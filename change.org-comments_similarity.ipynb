cyber abuse inspires change to public safety to save lives https www.truehollywoodtalk.com amber heards story cyberabuse inspires change public safety save lives amber heard took photos texts recordings and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted. heard who tried to lead and speak against abuse such as supporting a sexual assault survivors bill of rights and going to the united nations general assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet. domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in america yet no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. there are up to 900 000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the usa. then retaliation such as seen against amber heard makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change. when people tabloids or agendas on the internet attack amber they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map you cannot see first responders coming or when they ve arrived. you cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. there s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims. by criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities they re preventing progress. when witnesses reporters businesses and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24 7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support and to even make people afraid of testifying it s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that amber heard first wrote about in the washington post in december 2018. two audios were framed on the internet in february 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life that she was kicked repeatedly that bodyguards said that she would be killed and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn t worked on yelling. it s rationalizing harming women

      "change culture so that women can say they re victims of domestic abuse. those saying they re victims while attacking amber are fake... maybe i didn t get beat up or sexually abused physically but i could have been. then it s so scary to ever say that because it s silenced and retaliated. women cannot just leave their homes or get away from abusers. abusers continue to harm women even when they put distance between them. it s happening right now with amber s example too. men often are richer then they use this power and leverage to harm women that leave them and their children such as myself. the stalking the phone calls of breathing this and that. now depp can harm amber the same way but using others since he s rich enough. now they want to invalidate 12 times of domestic violence really when we see this how many more years will it be in the united states until people like myself can ever say we were victims when i see this how can i say i m a victim or others because harassment didn t lead to violence when it could have because we avoided it amber heard is a victim and it s so great that she spoke out. i know there s fear in saying that but i definitely call her a victim as a 3rd party. she went through extreme violence. it s horrible enough to think of what could have happened let alone what did. 2 1\n",

      "amber heard inspires us we support her life her role in aquaman 2 her humanitarian work and any work she has. we support her evidence and public safety to save lives. amber is not only powerful as mera but she is also an activist for human rights. she was the first american actress to be named human rights champion to the united nations human rights office. she s an ambassador for the aclu donor to women s rights groups protector of refugees and does charity. she has spent years helping children. she s an inner philanthropist and advocate who should have a voice. we want to see her in more films movies shows modeling and work in the entertainment industry. we want to see more equal rights advocacy she s a positive influence on us and we should see more of her we want powerful women who can be respected and treated equally. we created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. we want her humanitarian work and leadership to continue... would you stand up to prevent or stop domestic abuse the social question is also would you save her we support amber heard s life and her humanitarian work... amber heard was domestically abused by her ex husband and is still abused by johnny depp and his followers with coercive control threats incited hate financially emotionally and online daily. we would rather not refer to him but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims. amber heard wrote in the washington post as an ambassador for the aclu about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from depp fans and how she supports rights amber heard i spoke up against sexual violence and faced our culture s wrath. that has to change. amber heard is innocent and we support her leadership such as her advocacy with the united nations and american civil liberties union being a spokesperson for l oreal her contracts with businesses nonprofits and causes and her largest movie role as mera in aquaman. we should be able to speak out to create change. we can change culture to improve lives... the abuse against amber includes choking her repeatedly a concussion over a dozen physical experiences of violence pushing control of travel isolation losing weight and physical health while with depp losing confidence and intimidation. in deposition videos in 2016 she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered. society is not only not victim centered to tell women to protect themselves it isn t proactive to tell us to help victims. gathering data and leading for change is exactly what amber heard should have done amber heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos texts audios videos data medical references and descriptions of abuse threats injuries distress and violence from depp in her legal filings in her dismissals in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused and in court. she has extensive evidence supporting her uk judge nicol ruled on november 2 2020 that the abuse against amber is valid. he validated 12 physical assaults against amber with a winning case for her ngn in the united kingdom and that depp put her in fear of her life. 129 pages . her first april 2019 dismissal has photos texts and descriptions https www.documentcloud.org documents 5835867 amber heard motion to dismiss.html her detailed statements and citations of evidence including her injuries in uk s july 2020 ngn trial statement 1 statement 2 statement 3 statement 4 statement 5 statement 6 and statement 7. ngn s evidence in closing submissions for the uk trial. videos of amber heard is innocent video one video two and video three on our channel. also her side of audio two where she feared for her life. see over 16 videos including audio which was cut out of leaks on incredibly incredible s channel such as jd telling amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... io tillett witnessed amber s blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. io was the first to call 911 to protect amber from her husband https www.latimes.com entertainment gossip la et mg amber heard io tillett 911 call 20160608 snap story.html according to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex jd staff on social media march 29 to april 2019 staff were on ndas witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering and would check on amber after their fights. they supported amber and said she was kicked repeatedly hit and crying but they were too afraid to witness. screenshots google folder and video. in the july 2020 uk ngn court trial s exposures showing strong support for amber heard the
