    <blockquote>I am not a bot! I am a 46 year old, 3x Domestic Violence Survivor. 2 men, 2 separate relationships, I was their verbal punching bag and yet I found a way to survive from the love my sons provided. The third came from the hands of my own brother, a man I loved & trusted and he nearly killed me. Amber Heard does not speak for me, not now, not ever!!</blockquote>
