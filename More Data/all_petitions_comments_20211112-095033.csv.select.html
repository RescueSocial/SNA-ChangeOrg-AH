    <blockquote>People have to be held accountable for the terrible things that they put on other people. And not hide behind the fact that they're a woman or that they're gay. Don't insult other women. Women are not victims we're not going to whine and cry because we're stronger than that and we have come a long way, but people like Amber Heard are pulling us back after years of progress for women. I hope the general population understand that we aren't a bunch of Amber heard's we are so much better than that.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>As a recovering victor of sexual, physical and emotional abuse, I am appalled that Amber Heard has continued to be rewarded, despite her vindictive, manipulative, narcissistic behavior. Mr. Depp was nearly destroyed by her lies.  He lost multiple contracts and has had to fight for his character. <br />Because of woman like her, many innocent victims go unheard, and have to be victimized even more by investigators. Some never find the justice they deserve.  #justiceforjohnnydepp #boycottaquaman2 #justiceforabusedmen</blockquote>

Elle est clairement l'abuseure et utilise depuis des années les médias pour mentir, se faire passer pour une victime quand.en fait elle est l'abuseure. Johnny a déjà perdu 2 rôles majeurs à cause de.ses mensonges... tout ça est déjà allé trop loin... elle mérite de payer pour tout ce qu'elle a fait et être bannie d'Hollywood. Ce qui ne serait pas une grosse perte! Elle ne sera pas connue pour son talent ( qui est absent!!) Mais pour être une narcissique-menteuse- abuseure et manipulatrice.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Amber Heard was secretly recording fights she instigated with Johnny. Only to save them all to use in court against him. Her very sad attempt at making herself look like a victim. This premeditated act of deceit, not only proves how she's manipulating the court, but that this has been a hidden agenda for her for quite some time, which in turn states, she NEVER loved Johnny Depp, she's been using him from the beginning. If anyone in Hollywood should be requested to leave, it should be her. Place discard this greedy, manipulative, talentless whore.</blockquote>

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. <br /><br />Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.<br /><br />Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. <br /><br />Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.<br /><br />As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. <br /><br />Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.<br /><br />Do the right thing. Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2.</blockquote>

Despite all evidence to the contrary, men are still treated as guilty even after being proven innocent, while false accusers are left with no repercussions for maliciously falsifying statements to hurt the accused's career and reputation. Amber Heard has just watered down and exploited a movement that was supposed to help actual victims of domestic abuse and sexual harassment. She is a pathological liar and manipulator. She needs to be held accountable.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Mr. Depp has been innocent all along yet had to go through hell, humiliation and hatred of the masses even without any significant proof or evidence that he was the abuser. He didn't deserve any of it and it's about time Amber Heard goes through the same and gets what she deserves. You know, fair, equal treatment and all. A manipulative liar and gold digger like her doesn't get to be in a spotlight and to be a star after she intentionally trashed his name and reputation. Unfortunately for herself, she chose to mess with a wrong man - a talented genious like Mr. Depp has billion of fans and admirers all over the world that believed him from the very beginning and they stand true and strong in his fight against his perpetrator. I'm so glad that she didn't get away with it and the truth surfaced. #Ibelievehim , #IstandwithJohnnyDepp , #JohhnyDeppisASurvivor, #AmberHeardisAnAbuser<br /><br />So now, I believe it's time we demand justice for Johhny Depp! He lost his role as Jack Sparrow because of Amber Heard's false accusations of domestic abuse and lies. Please, follow the link below to sign the petition to keep him in POTC franchise. Together, we are strong and powerful and can change the course of events. Disney will have to hear us and consider the fans wish . They are making movies for us, the audience, and they must consider what we want. After all, Mr. Depp is a victim here and hasn't done anything wrong to lose one of his most epic roles. Besides, POTC movies are not POTC without him. Just waste of film and time. Please, sign, share and support to make Heard really mad and not let her destroy his career he's been building all his life with hard work, unlike her. #JackSparrowforever #JohnnyDeppisJackSparrow<br /><br /><a href="https://www.change.org/p/disney-keep-johnny-depp-as-jack-sparrow-56940bb8-c877-482f-bf8a-ec2c57ccb32f" rel="nofollow">https://www.change.org/p/disney-keep-johnny-depp-as-jack-sparrow-56940bb8-c877-482f-bf8a-ec2c57ccb32f</a></blockquote>

The fact that she referred to Johnny as a 'baby' and told him he 'needs' to grow up because he spoke up to her about her abuse pisses me off to know end. There are TOO MANY Amber Heard types in the world and I refuse to sit idly by and watch an innocent man's life be destroyed because of a sick twisted daemon of this calibur!</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Johnny Depp is my favorite actor of all actors and of all times. If he is not on movies like Fantastic Beasts, Alice in Wonderland, Pirates of the Caribbean anymore than why would I want to monthly subcribe to a fucking movie platform with double standards. Amber Heard is no angel an is setting a bad influence for young girls. An influence of victimisation, getting away with lies that can ruin a man's career but not yours. Where a woman can be the abuser with no punishment. Jonny Depp is not guilty and he should be now back making movies.!!!! Fuck HBO Max and Disney+ if Depp is not back in business!!!!!!</blockquote>

This is confirmed by tape recordings that both Depp and Heard made of each other discussing their problems while they were trying to mend their marriage.  Also, a man does NOT just suddenly become an abuser of women in his 50’s.  Johnny Depp’s former partner of 14 years (and mother of his two children) has spoken out stating that Johnny was never abusive to her in any way.  Other women that Johnny had been in long term relationships with have also denied that he was abusive to them in any way.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Listened to the recordings of Amber heard's abuse towards Johnny despicable. I've heard the same words from my abuser "I was hitting you not punching you." she assaulted him  when all he was trying to do was find a safe place in the bathroom to hide from the anger and daily abuse likely. Women it's never okay to hit a man. just like men should never hit a woman. you should never hit anyone except to protect yourself from the harm you are receiving from some one and have no other choice. being a survivor of abuse seeing the exact same behaviors in the recordings from amber as my abuser it's clear she abused johnny.  she messed up by divorcing johnny because she sabotaged her own cycle of abuse and manipulation. she did him a favor and turned to fictitious claims of abuse when her act backfired. it's textbook abuse from a female perpetrator.  If johnny did hit her it was likely in self defense from one of her "hitting" sprees. There is nothing more terrifying then seeing the deranged look on the face of some on you love as they "hit" you as hard as they can pretending they are "play fighting"  there is no difference between "hitting" and punching. And there is no weaker feeling then telling some one to stop hitting you and they won't even if you are stronger and able to get a hold of their hands and pin them down so they can't hit you. they will just wait and hit you again. No matter how many times you tell them to stop. You can hear the insecurities that are the center of amber's abuse. She's afraid that if she stops abusing him that johnny will split and leave her. So she stages anger fits and pushes him to try and resolve the situation of her anger to keep him in this cycle of dealing with her shit so he can't think of anything else. it's very evident that no other ex of his would expect him abusing some one and that they never received any abuse while with him that any physical abuse that johnny depp "did" was likely self defense from physical abuse from Amber. she is textbook abuser. And johnny reacts reacts to the violence is textbook male victim. he acknowledges that injury he caused her was wrong in the recording and when he tries to open her eyes up to the abuse she freaks out and runs takes off. knowing she got his attention that effectively she won and achieved her goal. subconsciously that is what she did. no accountability for hurting depp. you can't chase some one down when they are trying to get away  force yourself on them and hit them and not be an abuser. If some one needs space give them space.<br /><br />Any ways domestic violence happens to men so much but people rarely acknowledge it. empower men to get out of abusive relationships. Depp we are with you.</blockquote>

And this case may be a joke to some but to those of us who can know this is not right. Johnny Depp was accused by many reporters and his ex-wife Amber Heard claiming he was a wife beater. When we all know it was a lie that it was the other way around.<br /><br />Johnny Depp was beat by pots and pan 24/7.  It went so far as that he had to set up security cameras in his own home. His home was supposed to be his safe space but it wasnt. Johnny Depp deserves better then this he is not a wife beater but Amber Hear is a husband beater. And if the filmed evidence is enough for you how about the videos of her admitting to it. So yall can call him what yall want but he in innocent and those of us who care will sign this petition till he is hear.</blockquote>

Hollywood and Disney are now having unprofessional behaviour and political correctness that are all plaguing the quality of potential films that make me refuse to buy them. All of these feminazis, snowflakes, and virtue signalling celebrities from the Disney company and the Hollywood industry are making me realise how the entertainment industry is being controlled by people who are pretentious idiots. Which is why I feel sorry for Johnny Depp when he has to deal with these feminazis, snowflakes, and virtue signalling idiots who aren't being accountable for their actions because this world has crazy fans who act crazy towards their celebrities instead of people acting like civilised adults that treat their celebrities like the flawed human beings that they really are. When there are crazy fans supporting celebrities blindly, this tells me that there are parents who probably aren't raising their children to behave like civilised adults. This tells me that society is doing something wrong. Johnny Depp is a flawed person who has feelings and thoughts. He has had his friends and ex say that he would not be an abusive person in a relationship despite what Amber Heard has said. From what I have witnessed, Amber Heard probably fabricated everything to make Johnny Depp seem like he was the abuser. Even though Johnny Depp says he knows how to lie, especially since he's an actor, I'm not convinced that Johnny Depp actually abused Amber Heard. There's absolutely no evidence that Johnny Depp really harmed Amber Heard, which is why there is no evidence that justifies Johnny Depp being fired from future Disney movies and future Hollywood movies. Virtue signalling idiots, feminazis, and snowflakes can support Amber Heard all they want, but they don't have logical evidence to justify making Johnny Depp lose his career in the Hollywood industry nor the Disney company. If allowing predators to abuse men because of some petty revenge game to fight against patriarchy is happening in the entertainment industry, then I'm done with Disney and Hollywood altogether because it's just showing me that Hollywood and Disney are not being controlled by professionals but petty drama queens that I don't want to waste my brain cells on.</blockquote>

I don't know him personally even though I wish I did, but he never seemed like the type of person to do that. So it broke my heart when this scandal came out and it makes me sad that people still want to believe the abuser over the victim. Amber Heard is an abuser and Johnny does not deserve the hate that he has been receiving. #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AbuseHasNoGender</blockquote>

And now all the evidence shows that SHE was the actual abuser and he was falsely accused! He's lost his reputation, his career, his money - and his finger, no less! Meanwhile she's gotten more famous, gotten bigger film roles, became a spokesperson for L'Oreal, and became a face in the MeToo Movement (the irony). This whole situation is a farce!

    <blockquote>Justice for Johnny. He's innocent and seeing the facts & evidence unfold. We're observing the pattern of a sick, vindictive, diabolical 'I'll poop-on-your-bed' sociopath: Amber Heard - is clearly the actual physical, emotional, verbal abuser, guilty of faking evidence (bruises), perpetrated a hoax not even that well mind you – weaponized her female-gender victimhood to gain fame, attention, sympathy, financial gain via movies, appearances, pats on the back by deluded people. Women who lie about men are the worst kind, b/c they easily can and do take complete advantage of laws that are there to protect actual victims of abuse; weaponize to destroy an ex &/or men in general whenever they feel like they need the upper hand, feel powerful, in control, or for some other self-righteous gain, seeking to sabotage, destroy, get revenge or just man-haters in general. This is becoming FAR TOO COMMON. <br />Doesn't even have to be an ex, some do it for political reasons or to someone they just don't like. I've seen women falsely accuse men, even entice them/bosses into affairs to use against them to get ahead, some even admit it. Let's not be stupid, women also know how to use and abuse men, with such ease & no consequence or repercussions, in fact other women often even encourage these demented behaviours these days. And who would believe the man over the woman!? Who would even dare! Doesn't Amber herself even say this to Johnny? - to not even try going to court or say she abused him - b/c she's a (meek, weak) slender woman.? By evidence text msgs with Johnny, her own parents know her well, are scared of her and of pissing her off.<br />It is the cruelest for any person to be FALSELY accused. Not all men have the financial means to sue or even fight back. Liars, hoaxsters, who make false accusations truly diminish and anger real victims. I hope she goes to jail for making false accusations. Obviously she won't ever be punished for physical abuse perpetrated on her victims. # justiceforJohnny</blockquote>

To the person who told Lilly rose Depp she should not be born ( I usually do not say mean  things to people ) but I have to say this to that person today ..  Just like her father who I've known in my heart like forever and her mother mother she is the best loving kind sweet and innocent child that could be ever born and graces this earth with her poise her beauty her kindness her love and strength and to the person who said that mean thing to Lilly rose Depp should look at her self and see that she has nothing to give to this world ans she is useless I this works .. As for Amber heard she could never touch Venessa paradise who have everything beautiful that she has not and she reminds me of my mother who is just like her not a nice person and the only bad thing that this most loving man Johnny Depp ever did wrong was hurt his wife and children a little with that no good heartless ugly witch of an who knows what Amber heard is .. I know my mother clawed abuse where they was no abuse only for she to gain sympathy when it is Amber heard who is the abusers ..  In reality Amber not only hurt veanesaa paradise and Lilly rose Depp by dating and marrying Johnny Depp and then lying on him and hurting him him.. Amber heard also hurt the only person Johnny Depp who loved her and give a lot to her . Amber heard is ungrateful and this is not good for me to say but this world could do with less people like Amber heard and more people like Johnny Depp , Lilly rose Depp and Venessa paradise  </blockquote>

Oh, and what about that extra 7 million Amber was demanding Johnny send to the charities because he would get a deduction and supposedly would only have paid half the settlement??  Johnny signed the checks in the name of Amber Heard anyway, so that went away pretty fast. Thank goodness.  Now?  Harry Potter, a boy beaten by his aunt and uncle and messed around by Voldemort more than once...is used as an example of hypocracy by BLIND FAITH in the words of someone who lies about abuse just to get back at Johnny for not  being the "fantasy" she had as a teenager...and his money didn't hurt!  But people need to let this shit go, and stop boycotting all Johnny's hard work, while calling him a  "has been" or whatnot when his movies 'fail" because of these ridiculous boycotts.</blockquote>

Remove amber as the spokesperson to send a message that no abuser will go without consequences.</blockquote>

Someone like this deserves to be behind bars, not continually being on the front page of a magazine. She took advantage of the #MeToo movement, and people like her give it a bad name when there are actual people that have participated in the movement who have been abused. The double standards are absolutely disgusting, and this shouldn’t be a problem at the current age we are in. It is literally something you learn in Kindergarten, “treat someone the way you would want to be treated”. This is so ridiculous...</blockquote>

As it has been obvious for a long time now that JD was the victim of both physical and emotional abuse from Malignant Narcisist Amber Heard (who needs serious psychological help, assuming she is not beyond help), it is outrageous that L'Oreal has not dropped her. Or is "L'Oreal. Get the look of a Narcisistic Abuser!" the image they are trying to convey?<br />If L'Oreal seriously wanted to show support for victims of abuse, both female OR male, they would immediately drop Heard.  Abuse is abuse, and the terrible impact such abuse has on victims is far reaching and is not dependent on the sex of the abuser or the abuses. In this case, even worse as the abuser was almost successful in destroying her victim's career. Heard is a monster and a liar, and should be in prison rather than promoting L'Oreal</blockquote>

    <blockquote>As an actual victim of dv, it hurts me deeply that Amber Heard maliciously lied (and continues to do so) about suffering abuse at Johnny Depp's hands. Because of women like her who fabricate tales of violent abuse, it makes it so those of us who have actually suffered through abuse worry that no one will believe us and unfortunately some victims are looked at as liars. Worse still, because of this, some victims lose their lives at the hands of their abusers. They DIE!  What makes what Amber did all the worse on top of all of this, SHE was the abuser! L'Oreal should be ashamed and embarrassed that they continue to support Amber Heard given how her actions have made it harder and unsafe for actual dv victims to be believed, get help, and be protected. Since your company supports her, L'Oreal also impacts victims of violence, sexual assault, and abuse the same damaging way Amber Heard has and continues to. We expect more and given all the money we've spent on your products, I don't think it's too much to ask for you all to stand with us and against what Amber represents. She chose to do these things. Just as you chose to support her nonsense. Make the right choice ffs. Thank you.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Amber Heard is truly two-faced: <br />"Lovely on the outside, ugly on the inside." <br />"Her beauty is just skin-deep.".  <br /><br />She has given herself and Loreal a "black eye". <br /><br />Amber Heard has consistently and continually demonstrated, by her documented history of inflicting abuse on others while playing the martyred vicitm, that  she is psychologically addicted to this predatory, destructive, manipulative, narcissistic, "spoiled brat/self-entitled" behavior. <br /><br />It has become clearly evident that she seems to enjoy inflicting pain - psychological, physical, emotional.  <br /><br />In the true nature and spirit of an addict, <br />she defers blame to others and refuses acknowledgement or responsibility for her own behavior.<br /><br />Court-ordered psychiatric therapy, counseling treatment, mandatory community service at abused men/women's shelter AND an animal cruelty shelter AND a homeless shelter, a 12-step program, celibacy - <br />what will it take to reach her? <br /><br />Does she know, realize, recognize or have the willingness to discover if she has the capacity of humbleness/humility, empathy, sympathy, and selfless caring of others?  Does she have the personal fortitude and willingness to make amends to her victims?<br /><br />NO AMOUNT OF MAKEUP can disguise a person's ugly, cruel and hypocritical, narcissistic selfishness.<br /> <br />Loreal - please do not support her anymore, ever. I believe she is no longer worthy or deserving of any public status or public attention.<br /><br />I strongly urge Loreal to permanently remove Amber Heard from all of their brands as soon as possible.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>“Why I am boycotting L’Oreal/Paris”<br />L’Oreal/Paris makes tons of money from women.<br />The company is insulting our collective intelligence, by hailing Amber Heard as a role model for women.<br />Never mind that she put a cigarette out on Johnny Depp’s face, she viciously verbally abused him, cut his finger off (when he plays guitar in a band), and then she lied about it, in order to manipulate a friend to get TMZ to falsely report that Johnny cut it off.<br />Due to the time it took to get divorced, her both tempestuous and contemptuous marriage to Depp lasted 14 months, during which time, she had secret affairs with at least three people that have been named in court documents.<br />Despite her abusing Depp, she lied about it and filed court papers, in which she falsely claimed that he abused her, knowing that said statements would be made public.<br />She wrote an editorial, and commented at women’s events that she was a “abuse survivor,” falsely intimating it was Depp that abused her.<br />She has carried on this malicious campaign of hate, knowing that Depp would lose his lucrative Pirates of the Caribbean role, as well as others, that supported Depp and his family members.<br />Not to mention the many others that worked with this film franchise.<br />It is difficult to pinpoint how many people she has hurt with her lies.<br />While pretending to be a “victim” of abuse, and pretendinf to represent representing abused women, she has continued to lie about Depp.<br />This hoax perpetrated by Ms. Heard has caused so much damage to the Me Too movement, and to real women around the world that actually have been abused.<br />In a further hoax, perpetrated by Amber Heard, with both public relations and financial help from L’Oreal/Paris, I am supposed to believe that Ms. Heard is a “role model” to me.<br />L’Oreal/Paris must really think the women who buy its products are stupid.<br />When I was 15, I could take three hits of L25, and have more sense than to believe a scam like this.<br />I could say volumes more about the matter than this, but Loreal/Paris has insulted women all over the world with this sociopathic advertising campaign.</blockquote>

Also, people who actually people who saw what happened weren't believed while Nicol totally ignored their testimony over the word of Amber Heard when she clearly had no evidence of her own, just her word. She told five different stories before testifying in court all different from the testimony in court while Johnny Depp's story has never changed ever since the beginning. His evidence of abuse of her by him totally outweighs anything she says. He has corroboration she has no corroboration at all.

This truth can be seen with great clarity, as we have born witness to her scheming ways.  As far as I know, this is a country where men (and women) are innocent until proven guilty.  There is absolutely no proof that any of Ambers allegations against Johnny Depp were true.   The police have thoroughly investigated this matter and found that no crime has been committed.  Johnny's ex's all came forward with their testimony as a testament to his character and integrity.  Amber, in fact, used manipulative and dishonorable methods to put forward a story that is as full of holes as her own feeble mind.

That was epic!<br /><br />A blood-sucking tick lol... that's just how I would describe my incredibly jealous, cheating, narcissistic last girlfriend/ fiancé -- whom I made the huge mistake of bringing into my home. She did to me something very similar to what Amber Heard did to Johnny Depp. In some ways even worst, though... just without all the suing back n forth. In my case I had to take all the abuse and the cheating on her part for years; and then she added insult to injury by demonizing me even further in court after sticking me with a highly damaging restraining order when I couldn't take it any more and decided to pack her bags and remove her from my home. After that, she proceeded to vilify me with her incessant "abuse" rant at work and on social media. That was her vengeance for me breaking up with her and "kicking" her out. Oh, she made up so much sh*t! That's why I no longer believe everything that's made public in these so-called domestic violence cases. Yes, there are always some truths mixed in, but always sprinkled with plenty of atrocious lies to make things appear out of the ordinary and to render the man "abusive". Then there's the real truth that never comes out to the public... what truly happened. But the court never wants to hear that, oh no.... They are just focused on making the man appear "abusive" and deserving of punishment. Nothing but nonsense.<br /><br />Anyway, yeah..., Amber Heard should get the boot for being an annoying crybaby and a truly abusive person (in many ways) and for her never-ending lies. And that dude.. whatever his name is... the dude that's been protecting and supporting her all this time, he too needs to go ASAP. No place for abusive people and ultra-feminist idiots in society. It's time for a change. All I know is that I won't be watching any of their productions any time soon if those two are in them or involved in any way.</blockquote>

To hook him, take advantage of her marriage status to him as a tool to advance her career and then destroy him personally and financially with pathological lies and faked pictures. The evidence is overwhelming, and there’s so much more out there that hasn’t been tapped yet. She emotionally and physically abused Johnny throughout their marriage, leaving him having to fight for his sanity and career. And to see Disney and Warner Brothers turn their back on a man that’s made them millions hand over fist. While they side with an untalented, no body actress because she is a woman. Hollywood has know Johnny, his acting talent, box office appeal, and his personal character and work ethic. They know how highly respected he is professionally and personally. They turned their backs on him, not even listening to his side. Now they’re all regretting their decisions because the truth has come out, and it’s gonna cost them millions and the respect of the people.  Johnny has been through enough pain. It’s time he gets justice, and Amber gets a jail cell. So I will not watch Aquaman 2, along with about 200 friends and family. We boycott because our voices were not listened too regarding Ambers participation in the film. And myself and the same family and friends have stopped buying any products by L’Oréal and any of the companies that are affiliated with them. They all could have stepped up and fired her, yet even with all the proof of her deceptions and lies, they stay loyal. They’ve made a stupid and costly mistake over a pretty face with definite mental health and criminal issues.</blockquote>

There is so much evidence against her. She had a history behind her of abusing others. She abused her own sister,  her Ex girlfriend, and so many other people besides Johnny.  Johnny just got the worst of it. The whole world sees through her nonsense. Warner Brother's is making a terrible mistake and their name too will be forever tarnished. Give Depp his roles back and let Amber lie in the bed she has made for herself. She needs to take responsibility for her liars and actions by doing some prison time.</blockquote>

She is an abuser and should not be put on a pedestal just because she is a women. Women are just as capable to be abussers and criminals. She's abused him and has used her power as a women to manipulate the court into thinking it isn't possible that she did it. This way of thinking where a women can't comit a crime is tone  deaf and outdated. Men and women where born the same ways, and can do anything. She wants his money, and she wants to put him through hell. Do you want to see Johnny live a peaceful life, and provide the world with unforgetable content ?

Which is why Amber Heard is still going to be on Aquaman films until justice is served. I'm tired of seeing and hearing Amber Heard trying to act in films and in real life.</blockquote>

Fame whore and gold digger. Heard the audiotapes, she is legit crazy & not like anyone is perfect but Johnny Depp was the voice of reason and calm. She kept egging him on and he kept calm while she berated him for an hour on how terrible he is for walking away from her when she is violently fighting with him to escape her insanity.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Fools! Are you run by men or pussies? Scared of the screaming feminists? Completely out of touch with what the actual public thinks and you live in a Hollywood bubble, the public utilizes Twitter, Instagram and YouTube and the amount of content out there that supports Johnny Depp and is carefully and thoroughly explaining the evidence that contradicts Amber Heard's claim and proves her lies, and in her own voice everyone can listen to her shrill screams and threatening intimidation and admission of physical aggression against Johnny. Surely there are enough of you old crones at Warner and Disney that remember a time when journalists had to properly investigate and find evidence before printing an article. The word "alleged" seems to have lost importance and the mainstream media machine is hellbent on scandal. The Sun is tabloid garbage  . Johnny Depp was not arrested, charged or convicted of domestic violence. So the term wifebeater was incorrect, not based in fact, not accompanied by the word "alleged" and based only on the word of a vengeful and malicious woman looking to gain media attention and sympathy. Look into her history, you'll find its not so nice. She is hated, Johnny is loved and you made a very impulsive and bad decision in asking Johnny Depp to resign from his role in Fantastic Beasts. Congratulations, you now have a turkey on your hands because you've just all lost public support and the only reason anyone would have gone to see Fantastic Beasts.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>I'm signing because I am sick of this! Why won't she just leave him alone??? The bitch HAD her time and say! She's been proven to be a liar and guilty of EVERYTHING she's accused him of doing not just to him but to a lot of people! I hope Amber Heard is fucking proud of herself. Johnny deserve better than this and he deserves as much love and support and if he loses this then I hope she loses her whole career too!  I can't believe she's so hellbent on killing his career just to get attention while real victims like Johnny are penalized or ignored</blockquote>

    <blockquote>In the audio tapes that have surfaced  you can here Amber Heard complain that he ALWAYS runs away from her and won't stay and fight. She does not sound like somebody in fear for their lives, or somebody controlled and threatened. It sounds like the complete opposite! She talks about it like it is a common thing for her to get physical with him. Then she taunts him for not letting her hit him!  She also says she <br /> cannot promise SHE won't get physical again! Whether man or woman nobody deserves to be struck in a relationship, or belittled for trying to avoid conflict. As for his part it seems at most he likely had to push her off him to move past her to escape her attacks. This does not make him an abuser. If he is fleeing her he is not the abuser! She actually brags nobody will believe him! He has lost a lot because of her. Emotionally, and financially. Even now people still think he is to blame! Is it Just because she is a woman? So what! It is shameful she gets a pass when he sure didn't and he is the victim. Also It is a disgrace that anybody would have her be a representative for victims. She seems beautiful on the outside but in reality her behavior is just ugly, she is a liar and a manipulator, she is an abuser.</blockquote>
