Let’s make them hear us again!</a><strong><br><br>WE DID IT! Sort of.</strong><br>The Million American Petition has gathered over <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/the-people-impeach-donald-j-trump"" rel=""nofollow"">720,000 Signatures to Impeach Trump</a>! Every one of our petition signers should be proud that Trump has officially been impeached and their voices really did contribute to that decision. Donald Trump’s presence in the white house will always be a stain on American History. While we are proud to have pushed this effort into the spotlight across multiple platforms, we know our fight is not over. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>Mile Stones for the Million American Petition</strong><br><strong>Highlights from our journey together over the last 4 years.</strong><br><br><strong>This all started in 2016 on the night of Trumps inauguration.</strong><br>We knew early on Trump was unfit to serve as President of the United States. A small group of artists from multiple online communities banded together to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump. Doing this early on – as soon as he was inaugurated – was an important step to drawing a line in the sand between right and wrong.  We launched our petition with overwhelming support. Even a few celebrity callouts – from both friends and foes. – Which allowed our petition to grow into something much more than just a cry for help. It became a voice of truth for thousands of our petition signers.</p>
<p><strong>2017 brought the first ever Woman’s March on Washington.</strong><br>A needed effort to show our elected officials America does not stand for a sexism at the highest level. This was a big win for The Million American Petition also. Taking our efforts offline and into the streets. Participating in marches throughout the country in support of Woman everywhere. It was here that our Anti Trump T-shirts and signs gathered an abundant amount of attention. A whole new way to “turn out” which lead to signing up thousands of more petition supporters for Trump’s impeachment. By doing this we garnering everlasting friendship and support from people across all political spectrums and ideology. People who stuck with us through the hard times ahead.</p>
<p><strong>2018 was a hard year</strong><br>2018 was hard. People were frustrated nothing was happening. Even though impeachment finally was a hot talking point in the media. It seemed like Trump was allowed to get away with whatever he wanted and those responsible at the top would do nothing to stop him. People started to lose respect for our elected officials for doing nothing. They stood by while Trump continued to make a mockery American laws and ideology. People started to give up on the idea of a Trump free America. People simply started moving on with their lives in 2018. We don’t blame them. The fatigue was real. We were giving up also…</p>
<p><br><strong>2019 our voices were heard</strong><br>2019 rolled around and The Million American Petition came out with a new tone. One of anger and frustration. With just over 300,000 purely organic American signatures to back our message. We started calling out our elected officials for doing nothing while Trump continued to break the law and compromise national security. Calling out by name the leaders of the democratic party for being complacent in impeaching Trump. The American people wanted impeachment and that was clear. We were committed to make them hear us.</p>
<p>It worked! We were reached out to by multi-million-dollar interests to combine our petition with other impeachment efforts throughout the country. With one giant push from the efforts of Change.org, MoveOn.org, The Woman’s March on Washington, Need To Impeach, Democracy for America, Free Speech for People and last but not least The Million American Petition (That’s us!). We delivered over 10 Million combined impeachment signatures with U.S Representative, Lawyer, Mover &amp; Shaker Rashida Tlaib to the heart of the capital building.</p>
<p>After this, the topic of impeachment exploded in the Media. Our representatives started to realize that every moment Trump remained un-impeached was a direct reflection on their characters as leaders of this nation. If they were to do nothing it would sure amount to a disaster for the democratic party in the upcoming elections.</p>
<p>Signatures to The Million American Petition started piling in. In just a couple months we tripled the number of average signatures we were getting and gaining support from not just Americans but the entire world! It was crystal clear the pathway to impeachment was wide open and it was only a matter of time before impeachment was inevitable. So we pushed and continued to call out our representatives in all forums we had access to. Backed by our petition signers.</p>
<p><br><strong>And Finially… Christmas came early! Barely.</strong><br> On December 18th 2019 impeachment inquiry was wrapped up in a bow and delivered to the American people. An official announcement of the Impeachment of Donald J Trump was finalized. His presidency will be nothing but a mockery for centuries to come. An unfortunate stain on America.</p>
<p><strong>Impeachment does not mean Trump will be removed from office. All his power remains.</strong></p>
<p>Impeachment is similar to an indictment in criminal law. Therefor it is essentially the statement of charges against the president. A necessary step to removing Trump from office and charging him with his crimes.</p>
<p>We need to ensure Trump is removed from office. With the upcoming election we need to make it clear Trump is not only unfit to serve another 4 years in office. But that he needs to be fully removed from office and charged for his crimes. Impeachment was an important step to this. Now its time to walk the walk people!<br>Trump, an impeached president. Ordered the assassination of a high-level Iranian military official. Killing him without congressional approval and sparking outrage and potential cause for war. With thousands of troops already headed to Iran. People have begun speculating about WWlll. Which is the last thing we need.</p>
<p><strong>“We have an impeached, crazed president with the most powerful military in the world at his fingertips. Ordering assassinations of key military powers risking the lives of us all!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>– Ian Shannon-Garvey (Founder of The Million American Petition)</strong></p>
<p>Moving forward in 2020 we are starting a new petition. DEMANDING CONGRESS REMOVE DONALD TRUMP FROM OFFICE.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,22127469,2017-12-12T16:06:06.000Z,"Trump’s Tax Plan – Steal from the poor, give to the rich!","https://dumptrumpdumptrump.com/2017/trumps-tax-plan/

In less than a year of being in the white house Trump supporters are now fully doubting their elected president, his campaign promises of taking on the corrupt establishment seems to have disappeared into thin air. Now, with his proposed tax plan, he wants to do a reverse Robin Hood – steal from the poor and give to the rich.

This latest proposal is just one in the slew of hilarious proposals that have come from the Trump Presidency. It is also one more nail to add to the coffin of his presidency, ultimately leading to his impeachment.

Who does the Tax Plan Benefit?
President Trump’s tax plan was initially named the “cut cut cut Act” although it has now been reformed to the saner “Tax Cut and Jobs Act”. Still, it just points to the fact that the proposed tax plan has a lot of tax cuts – for the rich...

According to Politifact.com, a non-partisan website, 80% of the tax cuts in the proposed tax plan would benefit the top 1% by the 10th year of the plan. However, it seems that the cuts in this tax plan only apply to the wealthy. In 2018, middle income households are going to get an average tax break of $660. However, by 2027, more than one in every four middle-income families are going to pay more taxes than they presently do.

Eliminating estate tax
One of the ways President Trump hopes to favor the top 1% is by eliminating the estate tax. This is the tax the US government collects on inherited property. As it stand, the inherited wealth is a tool for widening inequality and creating a modern day American aristocracy. So, it is only fair that the US government taxes the wealth of the top 1% to run the state for everyone.

Sadly, President Trump, in his perceived wisdom, moves to eliminate the estate tax.

However, what President Trump and his cronies fail to mention is that estates currently get a tax break. Upon death, assets are written off to the higher market value or cost. This means that heirs do not pay any capital gains tax.

For example, if you buy a share at $10 and it rises to $100, you owe capital gains tax on the $90 profit. However, if your heir sells the stock at $100, there is no capital gains tax on the profit.

Before President Trump’s tax plan, this loophole has been checked by the estate tax. If the Trump tax plan sails through, there would be no capital gains tax for the top 1%, and there will be no estate tax.

To put this in proper perspective, imagine that two people own an asset at the same cost. One person makes a sale on the deathbed, while the other’s asset is sold on his demise. While the deathbed sale would be largely subjected to normal taxation, the inherited asset would have no capital gains tax or estate tax.

The Problem of Carried Interest
Another handout to the rich is President Trump’s refusal to fulfil his campaign promise to kill the loophole for carried interest. Carried interest is a term used to describe the fee income earned by hedge funds and other similar entities.

In the present tax code, this is treated as capital gain rather than income, meaning that they get a far lesser tax rate. This is despite the fact that the income the hedge fund managers earn is not from their own assets but on other people’s investment. Leaving things as they are is just an extra benefit to the top 1%.

Who benefits from the tax cuts?
President Trump and his supporters say that a major advantage in the tax plan is the slashing of corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. According to them, this will encourage American corporations to repatriate their profits and invest in the US economy, leading to more jobs and wage increase.

However, history has shown that this is just another way to benefit the top 1%. For instance, when George Bush enacted a tax repatriation holiday, the effects were disappointing. When the Senate studied the impact of the holiday in 2011, the results were not palatable:

“The report looked at the top 15 repatriating companies and found that, instead of spurring jobs and economic stimulus, the tax break was instead associated with increased corporate stock buybacks and executive pay.  The report also observed that the 5.25% tax rate created a competitive disadvantage for domestic businesses that chose not to engage in offshore operations or investments, and provided a windfall for multinationals in a few industries without benefitting the U.S. economy as a whole.”

 “There is no evidence that the previous repatriation tax giveaway put Americans to work, and substantial evidence that it instead grew executive paychecks, propped up stock prices, and drew more money and jobs offshore.”

In August, the Institute of Policy Studies looked at the US companies that paid the lowest tax rate. If there is wisdom in what President Trump suggests, these companies should pay higher wages and hire more workers. Instead they discovered that:

“Our calculations have revealed that the 92 firms [that pay a tax rate of 20% or less] in our sample had median job growth during this period of negative 0.74 percent, compared to the 6 percent job-growth rate of U.S. private sector firms as a whole.”

All this goes to show that when given huge tax breaks, corporations do not hire more workers or increase existing wages. Instead, they give their CEOs fatter paychecks.

Who Pays for the Tax Plan?
The US government surely needs funds to keep on running. Since the tax cuts and other features of the tax plan have taken a chunk of US revenue, where does the Trump government get its funds? The answer is straightforward, the middle class and other hard working Americans.

Targeting students
President Trump plans to fund his tax cuts and exemption by adding extra burdens on a hardworking class of Americans – students. The tax plan proposes to remove tax deductions on student loans. This is in addition to the other horrible ways the tax plan burdens this demographic.

A headline in the New York Times describing the plight of students read, “The House Just Voted to Bankrupt Graduate Student”. The plain irony is that this is impossible since students can’t declare bankruptcy for their student debts. This in a country where billionaires like Trump can declare bankruptcy six times. A country where the Fed can spend $29 trillion bailing out corporations that caused the 2008 financial crisis.

Slash Medicare and Medicaid
The Trump administration has also targeted another vulnerable demographic to help fund its tax plan. It plans to cut $473 billion from Medicare in the next 10 years. A painful blow to about 55 million Americans who depend on this program to take care of health care costs.

President Trump also applauds the budget cuts of over a $1 trillion from Medicaid within the next decade. This is the height of cruelty. Medicaid is a lifeline for about 77 million Americans. Most of them poor, disabled, children, or senior citizens. All just to make the rich get richer.

Eliminating local and state tax deduction
President Trump also plans to fund his tax cuts by ending federal tax deductions for local and state taxes. This means that Americans would be taxed double on the same earnings. For instance, if you pay a $1,000 tax to Sacramento, you’ll still owe $300 to the feds, on money that is already gone.

President Trump’s proposed tax plan is just the latest in his series of failings to the American people. His proposed health care plan was also a terrible contraption that was thankfully not allowed to see the light of day. Hopefully, this proposed tax plan goes that way.

The road to impeachment
Over time, President Trump’s series of blunders will lead him to his deserved destination – away from the White House. He seems to be one step closer to this. In the past week Michael Flynn, a major member of Trump’s campaign team and former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with the Russians in the lead to the elections.

With Michael Flynn’s cooperation, special counsel Robert Mueller will be able to uncover Donald Trump’s collusion with Russia – an enemy state – to bring him into power. In the end, the people of the United States will see Trump for what he is, and he will be impeached.

StarterPetitionUpdate,22090918,2017-12-03T05:18:42.000Z,MICHAEL FLYNN IS PAVING THE WAY FOR TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT,"Donald Trump very well may be the third sitting President in United States history to be impeached. These odds are looking much more likely following the Michael Flynn scandal which hit the news stands Friday. Resulting in Trump’s former national security adviser pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. A crime that can carry up to 5 years in prison. Admitting that Trump’s transition officials (lead by Mike Pence and Eric Kushner) directed him and his contacts with the Russians. This raises questions and concrete doubt that Trump was unaware of such handling and deals involving Russia. Directly lying to the American people. What is going on?

Scholar Noam Chomsky says this may be the most important moment in human history. (And he was born in the 20's)

The grounds for demanding a full investigation of impeachable conduct by the President-Elect are growing every day. 

We have four lines of defense against this new administration and there are already petitions for each, links are shared below. We need as many bites at the apple as we can get so please share these links and encourage others to share them too.


1st Line of Defense- Election Audit Petition. Some guys from MIT did some math on this and they strongly believe an audit will show that Hilary Clinton won the necessary Electoral College Votes as well as the “popular” vote. They have posted a petition here and it’s urgent! 
It’s especially important to share this link because it will not show in the Change search engine as being “about Donald Trump” 

Election Audit Petition :

2nd Line of Defense- Electoral College Petition. This is the petition that most people know about asking the electoral college to vote for the candidate selected by “popular” vote. It’s a chance so please sign if you haven’t already.
