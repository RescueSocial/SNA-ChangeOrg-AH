Having hit the 5000 mark today I've drafted the email and downloaded all signatures and comments (as of this morning) and will be sending the email today.  My communication to the ACLU will include a link to our petition, so feel free to continue to share the message, hopefully they'll check it out and see that people feel strongly about removing Ms. Heard from the list of ambassadors.  I will post another update tomorrow with the content of that email.  PS - signatures came from 77 countries!!

The fight is far from over though. I’m sure many of you have heard that Warner has decided to keep Amber as Mera. We cannot, and WILL NOT stand for this. Johnny not only lost his job as Captain Jack Sparrow, but as of recently lost his place as Gellert Grindelwald. She has continued to affect Johnny and his career. It’s wrong, and cannot be tolerated. The evidence is clear. So let’s continue to pursue and make our voices heard! Thank you! </p>",,,,warner-brothers-amber-heard-does-not-deserve-to-play-mera-in-the-next-aquaman-film,,against

Now, I'm Going to Go for MORE Signatures","In twenty-four hours, I've reached my goal of getting 128 people to sign my petition, Support JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts--Remove Ugly Slur on Johnny Depp!   However, wonderful as that accomplishment is, we need a lot more supporters to gain even better leverage on this very real issue. Johnny Depp was accused of something he did not do. He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter are calling him.  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny  Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others.  However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed!  Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.  Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face.  It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar...although he was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  However?  Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push  Johnny Depp's buttons.  It was malicious.  Once Amber learned of all the ammunition  Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up.  No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry, and not in character.  They took that video and assumed the worst. However, the camera filming the video was BEHIND  Amber Heard, not held in her hand.  Why else would we see her?  What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps  Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be?  He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera.  But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.

The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.  

NOBODY took into consideration that despite  Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible.  Why didn't anyone consider that? 

The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused.  Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial.  As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides.  Once I learned what was really going on, I went to town on social media.

But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other. We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans.  We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists.  Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work.""  This is not about that.  Johnny Depp is INNOCENT.  Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty are having trouble getting back to work. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT.   We can't allow him to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.

Let's stand strong against violence,  lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse!  Let's remember that all celebrities are not conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.

Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.

I will keep going until I get a million signatures if I can. :)

Thank you ALL for your wonderful support!!!",,,,kate-quinn-support-jk-rowling-s-fantastic-beasts-sequel-remove-ugly-slur-against-johnny-depp,,against

<p>The Sun have a reputation for falsely reporting media with an agenda and completely fabricating stories. </p>
<p>It seems this monopoly Rupert Murdoch has over the media is completely corrupted.</p>
<p><em>Keith Rupert Murdoch is an Australian-born American media giant. Through his company News Corp, he is the owner of hundreds of local, national, and international publishing outlets around the world, including The Sun and The Times in the UK, The Daily Telegraph and The Australian in Australia, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post in the US, book publisher HarperCollins, and the television broadcasting channels Sky News Australia and Fox News (through the Fox Corporation). He was also the owner of Sky (until 2018), 21st Century Fox (until 2019), and the now-defunct News of the World</em>.</p>
<p>In July 2011, Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the News of the World, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty, and public citizens. Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. </p>
<p> Many of Murdoch’s papers and television channels have been accused of biased and misleading coverage to support his business interests.</p>
<p>The sun has a long history of printing fake news, some of which has been so damaging and offensive it will never be forgotten, such as the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The sun ran a front page headline and blamed the fans for the Hillsborough tragedy, stupefying journalistic failure, it has become the public symbol of the lies at the heart of the cover-up. The editor still claims today that he was ""duped"" by corruption involving the sun, and a cover up to ""smear fans and protect the police"". </p>
<p>It wasn't that long ago that The Sun ran a story about how kind hearted Johnny Depp is as he visits children's hospitals regularly dressed as Captain Jack sparrow. It is clear and obvious, that they would do anything to sell a story, true or false as they would suddenly make these allegations against Johnny. </p>
<p>So with such a corrupt, evil and disgrace of a tabloid and news empire, and with the evidence so high against them, how did Johnny lose? Well now the connections between the judge, his son, ex wife and Rupert Murdoch are beginning to come to light. Collision? The judges son working for Rupert Murdoch? This entire case has seemingly been the biggest scandel of our recent years. </p>
<p>How is Rupert Murdoch not in prison? How is the judge not being investigated? So many questions. Only time will tell. </p>
<p>For major companies such as Disney and Warner Bros to fall behind this lies and corruption one can only guess as to why ��� </p>
<p>Let's show them that we know the truth. We stand by Johnny. Please help to share this petition and sign others that you can find to support him.</p>

<p>Upon reviewing the court documents, evidence and the verdict I can say that I do not feel this verdict was decided upon appropriately, and was quite frankly unfair. </p>
<p>The abundance of evidence that Depp presented was not taken into account, and in short the Judge said he agreed that Depp was assaulted by heard however he believes heard and therefore ruled in her favour despite her having no tangible evidence at all. In fact, all of her steaments and aqusations were contradicted by witnesses, even by heards own friends. </p>
<p>Further to this, there has been some information regarding the judges possible personal connections to Heard which has only made this case more strange.</p>
<p>Depp will hopefully appeal this decision, but in the meantime we must also fight for justice in the ways we can. Let's show our support and share this petition. Disney appear to be under the impression that they made Depp famous, when in fact he made pirates of the carribbean famous.</p>

<p>I want to say thank you to everyone who has signed the petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2. It’s been astounding, seeing so many people raise up their voices to let Warner Bros know that we didn’t want a known and proven abuser to play a superhero, or a role model that children could look up to.</p>
<p>However, our voices were not listened to.</p>
<p>So I’m asking you to sign this new petition to let Warner Bros, the studio responsible for supporting a known and proven abuser – Heard – while firing her victim – Depp – know that we refuse to support a franchise that continues to support Amber Heard.</p>
<p>We are not just faceless names on a petition, here. We’re the people who keep them in business with ticket sales. The primaries in the film have already been paid. They won’t be hurt at all by having the masses boycott the film. The only ones that will be hurt are the folks at the studio. Our ticket sales are essential for them to be able to afford to make more films, and stay in business.</p>

<p>The Jury also found that Adam Waldman made one defamatory statement against Heard in a Twitter post, with that being held against Johnny because the argument was made that Waldman was acting as Johnny's agent.</p>

The two were at the movie’s after party, and Amber Heard was singing the praises of her then boyfriend Johnny Depp for all to hear. Probably for attention, since using his name is about the only way she can get it.</p>
<p>At least one person at the party wasn’t impressed with Heard’s name-dropping.</p>
<p>Kevin Costner called her out, saying: “When you broke up with him for a day or two though it didn’t take you long to find your way into my trailer naked though did it?” He said it in front of ten people or more.</p>
<p>This has reportedly been confirmed by other people who were at the party.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Applause goes out to Costner for having the cojones to stand up and speak out to Amber Heard’s face, when it seems the rest of Hollywood are spineless and silent about her. If more people who know the truth about her had the guts to speak up, maybe she wouldn’t hold such a reign of terror over Tinseltown. And we know they’re out there.

13,StarterPetitionUpdate,29999379,2021-12-26T22:24:49.000Z,,Attack on Bettany,"<p>It seems that a floodgates of desperation and abuse has been opened.</p>
<p>Friends of Johnny Depp have come under fire from Amber Heard supporters, with Paul Bettany taking the worst of it. En masse, as if orchestrated to do so, Amber Heard supporters have begun to bombard Paul Bettany with abusive messages stemming from a conversation he had with Johnny Depp while Johnny was still in an abusive relationship with his how ex-wife Amber Heard.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of this conversation, Johnny Depp vented his frustrations about his abusive (ex) wife to his dear friend Paul Bettany, saying: “Let’s burn Amber!!!”</p>
<p>To which Bettany responded: “Having thought it through I don’t think we should burn Amber – she’s delightful company and easy on the eye, plus I’m not sure she’s a witch. We could of course try the English course of action in these predicaments ­– we do a drowning test. Thoughts?”</p>
<p>Depp responded: “Let’s drown her before we burn her!!! I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.”</p>
<p>It’s not pretty, but we have to keep in mind that Johnny had been abused by Heard for years, including incidents during which Heard threw a bottle at Johnny Depp, cutting his finger off, punching him in the head, kicking a door into his head and putting a cigarette out on Johnny Depp’s face. It’s not uncommon for victims to vent against their abusers to friends or family. Besides which, what isn’t often mentioned about these texts is the last one that Johnny sent, which said:</p>
<p>“I am admittedly too f-cked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love… for little reason, as well as I’m too old to be that guy. But pills are fine!!!”</p>
<p>That’s right. After everything she had done to him, he still loved her. It wasn’t until some time later that he realized that she didn’t love him anymore, if she ever loved him at all. At that point, his heart still didn’t want to give up on her.</p>
<p>Point being, that’s the text exchange that Heard fans are up in arms about, Johnny Depp venting to his friend about being abused. These people seem to conveniently ignore the abuse that Johnny’s venting about. Texts sent in private that were never meant to be seen are being hailed as Johnny Depp being “abusive” but the mountain of evidence proving that Heard was actually the abuser is swept off to the side, ignored.</p>
<p>No, Heard’s fans insist, the fact that the text exist at all is proof that Johnny is the abuser. Clearly, they say, the texts are threatening toward Heard and he must be held legally liable for them.</p>
<p>The court disagrees. In response to Heard’s counterclaim, the texts are irrelevant and inadmissible saying that: The remaining two allegations of computer usage fail under the third prong of the VCCA because Ms. Heard has not alleged that they were made with the intent to ‘coerce, intimidate, or harass.’ See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Rather, it appears that Mr. Depp texted those statements privately, to two of his friends, and Ms. Heard has not alleged that Mr. Depp intended for her to see them. Accordingly, this Court sustains the Demurrer to Count III since none of Ms. Heard’s allegations satisfy the prongs of the VCCA.”</p>
<p>She TRIED to say that those texts were a threat, coercion, or intimidation toward her in some way, but the court slapped it down.</p>
<p>Still doesn’t stop her supporters from using them, though. They’re inundating Bettany with a litany of Tweets today, saying things like: “Believe me</p>
<p>@Paul_Bettany, <a href=""https://twitter.com/CoraMelodie/status/1474801755074539529"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">this was waaay less unpleasant</a> than Amber Heard finding out that her abusive ex-husband Johnny Depp and his druggie buddy were joking about killing and raping her Sorry but, I'm having a hard time shedding a single tear for you.”</p>
<p>Depp supporters are stepping up, though, defending Bettany, saying: <a href=""https://twitter.com/FMGiveMeTruth/status/1474818032195313667"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">“these texts were never sent to amber heard</a>, it was dark tasteless humor between friends and they don't change the fact that amber heard is a lying, abusing sociopath who steals millions from dying children.” A reference to the fact that Heard has claimed many times, on television interviews that she donated 3.5 million of her divorce settlement to a children’s hospital, when in fact she never did.<br>And:<br><a href=""https://twitter.com/roaringrapids22/status/1475165213557207048"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Conveniently,</a> the media never mention the text exchange between Johnny Depp &amp; Paul Bettany is taken from a Monty Python sketch, nor do they usually publish the end of the text, where Mr. Depp says, ""I could never do this to someone I love.""</p>
<p>If you ask me, Heard’s supporters ganging up on Bettany is no better than what they’re accusing Johnny Depp of. Johnny Depp’s texts were private and understandable, while they’re attacking a friend of his publicly and without provocation. And they’re doing it at Christmas. Bettany is a family man, making this an especially devious time to harass him.</p>
<p>But, as appalling as this behavior is, it is not surprising. April 2022 is rapidly approaching, and Heard will have to face the music in Depp’s $50 million defamation suit. I suspect that the closer that date gets, the more devious antics we’ll see from Heard’s camp. If they weren’t so cruel, they’d be comical in their predictability. We can only cringe to think of what Heard and her buddy Eve Barlow will come up with.</p>

So let’s take a deeper look at the auction. They should be clearer in the headline.</p>
<p>What you can expect to bid:<br>Right now, there’s only one bid, even though the auction has been posted for days. And that bid is for $1,050, by someone called ‘Unsparing Bidder.’ Weird, but whatever.<br><br>The next minimum bid you can make is $1,300.<br><br>So, if you really have a burning desire to talk to Amber Heard, you can expect to spend thousands. According to the auction page, this package is worth $5,000.<br><br>And here’s what you get:<br>“Join Amber Heard for a Zoom Call to discuss Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and receive an autographed comic book signed by the cast of the upcoming Aquaman sequel!<br><br>The comic book signatures include Amber Heard, Randall Park, Patrick Wilson, Jason Momoa, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Dolph Lundgren, and Director James Wan.”<br>So the comic IS signed by most of the cast. Good to know.</p>
<p>So, if you’re an Amber Heard fan, it looks great, right? Well, wait. There are a few caveats.</p>
<p>The Zoom meet and greet will only last 10 minutes. <br>So plan your chat accordingly. Have those questions planned out, because you’re not going to have her all day. You’re not even going to have her for an hour.<br><br>Experience expires on Dec 17, 2022. <br>So get it in while you can.<br><br>Experience blackout dates: Holidays. <br>So be sure there aren’t any holidays taking place when you schedule your chat. That might keep you from getting your prize.<br>And further:</p>
<p>The auction is valid for 1 person. <br>So it looks like your spouse, bestie, whoever, can’t sit beside you and chat along. Just you.<br><br>Participant must be at least 18.<br><br>This is a private virtual meet and greet via Zoom. <br>I’m sure glad they cleared that up, since they said in the headline that the meet and greet is via Zoom.<br><br>Approximate duration: 10 minutes. <br>APPROXIMATE duration? That means that your chat could be cut short. Instead of 10 minutes, you could get 2, and since the word APPROXIMATE is right here in the rules, you won’t be able to complain or get your money back.<br><br>Photos are not allowed. <br>Wait. If I get to talk to Amber Heard, I can’t take any pictures? Well, that’s a rip. I’d REALLY like to get a snap of her face when she realizes it’s me she’s talking to.<br><br>Sharing of login information is forbidden and can result in cancellation of the experience. <br>This looks like a convenient way for you to get stiffed If they even THINK you shared their login information, they can cancel your experience.<br><br>Recording, screen grabs, or distribution of the session is strictly prohibited unless otherwise approved by the donor. <br>So, no snaps, grabs, or recording of any kind unless Amber Heard says it’s okay? What do you think the odds are of that?<br><br>Zoom will be scheduled based on Ms. Heard's availability and potential alignment of time zones. <br>This all kinds of slippery. The chat will be scheduled according to Ms. Heard’s availability? So all she has to do is say she’s busy and you could be out thousands of dollars and have nothing to show for it.<br><br>Description of the merchandise is as follows:<br>The item is new. <br>Well, one would certainly hope so.<br><br>Does not include a certificate of authenticity. <br>For collectors, not having a certificate of authenticity might be a deal breaker, since you can’t prove that the comic and signatures are authentic.<br><br>The rules and regulations state that the prize:<br>In condition as donated. <br>Wait. Didn’t they say a minute ago that the prize is new? What’s up with that? Or do they mean the condition Ms. Heard is in? Given her reported chemical proclivities, that could turn out to be one hilarious chat. Too bad you can’t record it.<br><br>Cannot be returned or exchanged. <br>So, no matter what happens, you’re stuck paying thousands of dollars with no guarantee of what you’ll get. That’s something to think about.<br><br>Experience cannot be resold or re-auctioned. <br>So you’re stuck with it. Remember that.<br><br>Cannot be transferred. <br>So even if you think someone else is more deserving, you can’t let them have it. Kind of a shame.<br><br>Blackout dates may apply. <br>Again, slippery. WHAT blackout dates, and who gets to decide? This is yet another red flag that you could end up paying thousands of dollars only to get stiffed.<br><br>Additional shipping charges may apply based upon the location of the winner.<br>We expect all winning bidders and their guests to conduct themselves appropriately when attending an experience won at Charitybuzz. Polite manners and respect for the generous donor and adherence to any rules or parameters are a must.<br><br>What behavioral guidelines does SHE have to follow, eh? Sounds like they can cut your experience short if they even think you’re looking at her the wrong way. Another way for you to not get what you paid for.<br><br>To be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon date, based on the donor's availability. <br>They already said that part. Why the need to double down on it?<br><br>So there you have it. That’s the great prize for paying upwards of $5,000 or more.

<p>Wow. What petition are they looking at?</p>
<p>Oh. It's mine, since they call me out by name and refer directly to the petition to <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2</a>. </p>
<p>While I wish I could say that the headline is true and that she's been fired, I'm afraid I can't back this one. Not exactly. While it's true that her filming time seems to have been severely limited compared to the rest of the cast, and the fact that the film has moved filming locations from London to Hawaii, while Heard didn't relocate with the rest of the production. It looks like it's possible that Heard's role may be MUCH smaller than she'd have us believe. </p>
<p>Time will have to tell whether that's true or not.</p>
<p>But I do have to set the record straight. The petition has not reached 20 million signatures. Not even close. But we HAVE nearly reached 2 million, making it one of the biggest petitions on Change.org. </p>
<p>For a while, the <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2</a> wasn't searchable. Not on Change.org, and not on Google. The numbers stagnated and didn't really move at all.</p>
<p>But I'm happy to say that the petition is searchable again, and those numbers have started creeping back up, slowly but surely. We average about 100 new signatures a day. That's not going to break any records, but it's slow and steady progress. It's proof that there are still more and more people out there that do not want to see Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. They don't want to see her in anything, honestly, but this petition only pertains to Aquaman 2. </p>
<p>And, sadly, we cannot confirm that she's been removed. Her role might have been reduced, maybe even filmed in such a way that she can be edited out and replaced, depending on how Johnny Depp's 50 million dollar defamation suit against her goes. But, as of right now, it looks like she's in it. For now.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is there a chance that Heard will be edited out if she loses the defamation case against her?

They were ordered to “produce the books, record, electronically stored information and tangible things designated and described” — including “verbal conversations, telephone calls, letters, emails, memoranda [and] reports” — by January 17, 2022. The documents request that any communications between the men and Heard, 35, relating to allegations of physical injuries or harm sustained by her as a result of alleged conduct by Depp, 58, and allegations of physical abuse or domestic violence committed by either party be turned over.</p>
<p>Musk is scheduled to be deposed on January 24, 2022, while Franco is scheduled to be deposed on January 26, 2022. </p>
<p>The question is whether or not they’ll comply.</p>
<p>Musk has notoriously evaded giving any testimony throughout Johnny Depp’s ongoing legal woes with his ex-wife Amber Heard. Will he show up to sit for his deposition? Will he turn over all of the communications described above?</p>
<p>Musk is on CCTV being snuck into Depp’s condo to spend quality late-night time with Heard while Depp was away working. He was seen in Heard’s company on or about the dates that Heard claimed to have been abused by Depp. And I’m willing to bet that he, Musk, saw Heard up close and personal. So he’s in a position to say whether or not he saw any actual injuries on her. What will he testify if asked that question? Other people have already said that they saw her on and around those dates with no injuries. Will Musk say the same? Is he willing to perjure himself for her?</p>
<p>If they actually get Musk to sit for his deposition, I guess we’ll see what he says.</p>
<p>As for Franco, he also spent quality time with Heard in Depp’s condo while Depp was away, so he also got what I’m guessing is a very good look at her. Besides which, he lived in the same building, so he had lots of chances to see Heard with or without injuries. What will he say?</p>
<p>Depp vehemently denies that he ever abused Heard, and insists that he’s dedicated to clearing his name. He says: “Ultimately, the truth will come out in all of this and I will be standing on the right side of the roaring rapids. I hope other people will be too,” he said, adding: “I will never stop fighting. I’ll never stop.”</p>
<p>The 50 million dollar defamation suit is set to get underway early in 2022. In the meantime until then, motions are being heard and depositions are being collected.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Musk sit for his deposition? What will Franco have to say? Will Johnny Depp be cleared, or will Heard score another win against him? Drop by Twitter and let us know.</p>

There’s no proof to back up this claim, but there is <a href=""https://jambernews.wordpress.com/2016/06/30/mug-shot/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> – a mug shot of heard being arrested for driving on a suspended license in 2003. That would have made her 17 years old. </p>
<p>The photo shows her leading with her jaw in her typical arrogant manner, with apparently no remorse whatsoever for why she got arrested. I guess some things never change.</p>
<p>In the comments on that post, people recall that a Texas teen had her license suspended for 5 years as a result of a fatal drunk driving incident, but none of them specifically name Heard.</p>
<p>So, what did she do to get her license suspended? Was it because of drunk driving? Did she cause the death of a friend of hers? Does anybody out there know for sure? I’d love to know. And you can believe that it’ll show up here as an update if you do.</p>

<p>Judge Penney Azcarate has handed down a ruling that refused to allow Amber Heard’s lawyers to petition the Virginia Supreme Court to become involved in the case. Basically, Heard wanted the Supreme Court to throw out Depp’s defamation case because he lost the UK libel suit against the Sun tabloid, which labeled him a Wife Beater.</p>
<p>Judge Azcarate had previously ruled against Heard’s dismissal attempt, so Heard tried to go over the judge’s head and have the Supreme Court do it instead. It didn’t work.</p>
<p>If Heard’s appeal had been approved, it would have meant the end of Depp’s defamation suit against her.</p>
<p>Filed in March 2019, Depp’s defamation suit contends that Heard defamed him when she wrote an op-ed describing herself as a domestic abuse survivor. The op-ed didn’t name Depp, but followed months of Heard’s allegations that he had abused her.</p>
<p>Depp lost his role in Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise four days after the op-ed came out. Depp is asking for $50 million in damages.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Heard has filed a counterclaim against Depp asking for $100 million, alleging that Depp orchestrated a smear campaign against her – including allegations that Depp is/was responsible for this petition's creation.

<p>But if hearing that she abused Johnny Depp in her own words isn’t enough to convince you that her victim act is just that, an act, there’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/Marussia15/status/1426161911117324288"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">this audio of Amber Heard telling Johnny Depp why she lied and accused him of abusing her</a>. It’s not new, but it’s circulating lately so I thought I’d share it with you again. You may not have heard it before, or there might have been new evidence that’s got you ready for another listen. It’s the truth, and it’s out there. In print, in audio, online, just about everywhere.</p>
<p>But, hey. Don’t believe the mass media. They’re just in it for the money.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me. I’m obviously biased. I think Amber Heard should be sitting in an Australian jail for cutting Johnny’s finger off.</p>
<p>Believe your own ears. Heard says it herself. Admits it, tries to weasel her way out of blame by pointing the finger at somebody else, as per usual. But she says it. All you have to do is listen.</p>
<p>Or, if you can’t be arsed to listen to the whole thing, here’s the transcription:</p>
<p>“Laura Wasser had proposed that I need to… not proposed, I’m sorry, said that I would have to leave. That I’d be kicked out. I’d be evicted. So Rock and Josh and everybody, evicted in 21 days.</p>
<p>“No,” Johnny answered that fear, telling Amber that she’d have however long she needed to get her feet back up underneath her. “But I told you the last time we talked, told you that you were fine, that you stay there two, three, fucking four months, whatever. Just fucking figure it out. We’ll figure it out. You stay there, you’ll be comf-“</p>
<p>“I got that too,” She interrupted him.</p>
<p>“Be in your home,” he tried to assure her.</p>
<p>“No,” She insists. “I thought that too. They told me 21 days. THAT IS PART OF WHY I ACCUSED YOU OF DOING THAT.”</p>
<p>There you have it. In her own words, from her own mouth. Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of abusing her so that she and her friends could stay in the penthouses at the Eastern Columbia Building. Not because he actually abused her. Not because she was afraid of him. Because she didn’t want to lose the apartment. Never mind that she had her own place, her dad’s place, friends’ places and countless other places she could have landed, she insists that she would have been homeless if she had to leave the ECB, so she had no choice but to lie about Johnny Depp and accuse him of domestic abuse.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t convince you that she’s full of it, I don’t know what else to tell you. Either you’re stunned by her beauty (snark mode off), you’re too stubborn to believe the truth when it’s placed in front of you on a silver platter, or you’re a troll hell bent on mischief.</p>

<p>The reason for the request is that Heard is claiming that Depp’s alleged abuse left her with damages to her reputation and embarrassment and humiliation, as well as emotional damage. That opens the door for Team Depp to question exactly what Heard’s emotional state was at the time, and what it still is, ongoing. It is absolutely relevant and timely, so an independent mental health evaluation is most definitely called for.</p>
<p>Team Heard will undoubtedly fight against the evaluation, pulling out all stops to keep it from happening. There are, however, many in the public that think that Heard should be evaluated. They think that if she’s properly diagnosed, perhaps she can begin to get some help.</p>

<p>Depp is suing Heard for defamation following an op-ed the actress published in the Washington Post claiming to have been the victim of domestic abuse. She didn’t directly name Depp, but it’s pretty obvious who she’s talking about, especially after communications arose between Heard and the ACLU discussing that very matter.</p>
<p>Heard sought to dismiss Depp’s defamation suit on the grounds that a similar libel lawsuit Depp filed against the U.K. paper The Sun had been tossed in that country. Basically, Heard wanted the American defamation suit thrown out because Johnny lost the UK libel suit against the Sun.</p>
<p>Judge Penney Azcarate, however, remained unconvinced. “Defendant argues she was in privity with The Sun because they both had the same interest in the case,” Azcarate wrote. “The Sun’s interests were based on whether the statements the newspaper published were false. Defendant’s interests relate to whether the statements she published were false.”</p>
<p>In other words, no. The UK libel suit wasn’t about Amber Heard. It was about whether or not the Sun believed what Heard told them.</p>
<p>The American defamation suit is about whether or not Amber is lying when she says that she was abused at the hands of Johnny Depp, an assertion she’s repeated doggedly since the couple split. Entirely different animal.</p>
<p>So, as of right now, Johnny Depp’s defamation suit can continue as scheduled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Johnny Depp is receiving awards in different countries for his body of work, recent work, and ongoing projects. Anybody who said that Johnny Depp was over is seriously mistaken.</p>
<p>Heard, on the other hand, has no scheduled projects on her <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB</a> page. Perhaps she plans to spend time being a mother to her recently acquired baby daughter. Nothing wrong with that at all. A precious new life is a gift that deserves to be taken care of with the very best of intentions.</p>
<p>Or Heard has fried all her bridges in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Heard’s film dance card is decidedly bare except for her dubious involvement with Aquaman 2 and a project called “Run away with me” that’s been languishing in limbo for years.</p>

28,StarterPetitionUpdate,29399423,2021-07-30T19:26:34.000Z,,Efforts to have Heard removed from AM2 carried no water,"<p>So says producer Peter Safran when asked whether or not the social media campaign by Johnny Depp fans for Amber Heard’s removal from the DC sequel ever had any influence on the production and their casting decisions.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure,” said Safran. “You gotta do what’s best for the movie.”</p>
<p>If Safran and the AM2 franchise had any idea what was best for the movie, they would dump a known domestic abuser the instant audio came out with Heard admitting in her own words to abusing Johnny Depp. Any man would have been canned on the spot. Anybody else would have been fired. Period. Yet here’s Amber Heard, acting like she’s bulletproof, with support from inside the industry.</p>
<p>What a travesty.</p>
<p>But what’s funny is that Safran neglects to mention the petition to remove Amber Heard from AM2 petition, which carries almost 2 million signatures from consumers who promise to boycott the movie if she’s in it. And, despite efforts to silence the petition, more and more people sign it every day.</p>
<p>Likewise, the apparent inclusion of Heard in AM2 has re-ignited the #JusticeForJohnnyDepp crew on Twitter again. There’s a whole world of people out here that don’t want to see Amber Heard in AM2, and it’s not just rabid Johnny Depp fans, as the slanted media would have you believe. A great many people opposing Amber Heard are survivors of domestic abuse who are outraged that Johnny Depp, the victim of domestic abuse, is still being treated like a pariah while his abuser continues to work in films.</p>
<p>In fact, a great many of them really didn’t care for Johnny Depp one way or another, but were outraged that there’s such a biased double standard when it comes to male victims of domestic abuse, and that Depp continues to face false allegations of domestic abuse when he is, in fact, the victim.</p>
<p>Like the front page of this petition says, men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>At this time, it appears that Amber Heard is, indeed, involved with AM2. But we don’t know in what capacity, or to what extent. She could be the costar from start to finish, or she could be cast in just a few scenes that could easily be reshot after some judicial decisions are made about her. After all, Johnny Depp was removed from FB3 after filming already started. The same thing could happen to Heard after court happens.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget, after all, that she’s not just facing Johnny Depp in court for Defamation. She’s also being investigated by the FBI, and it Australia for perjury.</p>
<p>Her legal woes aren’t “just” civil. They’re also criminal.</p>
<p>So she and her cohorts can pooh-pooh the internet and the millions of people out here in the real world that are rallying against her, but her world might not be all roses and sunshine like she makes it out to be. There could be serious legal and financial ramifications that she’ll have to face, not the least of which is a massive flop when those millions of people boycott AM2.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what becomes of AM2, Heard’s legal issues, and her career. But I, for one, don’t see a thriving future for her in Hollywood moving forward. She got the AM franchise when she was married to Johnny Depp, sure. But her dance card isn’t looking too good otherwise. There are no new projects listed for her on her IMDB page, and the rumor mill isn’t churning out anything of merit.</p>
<p>Heard might be mugging for selfies now, but I’m pretty sure she’ll be laughing out the other side of her face when the dust settles.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is she getting away with it footloose and fancy-free? Or is the end about to catch up with her? Drop by Twitter and let us know what you think.</p>

30,StarterPetitionUpdate,29319766,2021-07-11T12:57:04.000Z,,Depp fans call for boycott,"<p>Fans of Johnny Depp are furious that the actor has been fired from two major movie franchises while his abusive ex continues to work. </p>
<p>Depp has lost roles in the Pirates of the Caribbean and Fantastic Beasts movie franchises because of allegations by his ex-wife Amber Heard that he was violent during their tumultuous marriage. Meanwhile, Heard is apparently still involved with the Aquaman movie franchise opposite Jason Momoa. </p>
<p>Now, Depp fans have taken to social media in a last-ditch bid to get the actress fired from Aquaman 2, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and get Depp rehired to both Pirates and Fantastic Beasts. </p>
<p>If that doesn't happen, scores of fans have promised to boycott Aquaman 2, as well as anything else put out by Warner Bros due to the injustice. </p>
<p>I don't think fans need to worry, however. Amber Heard is still in AM2 because she had a preexisting contract, not because of any new negotiations. And, judging by Heard's IMDB, she's got nothing new coming up. And it's highly unlikely that she will get many new film projects, if any. Not only are there the ongoing legal woes with Depp, Heard was heard on tape admitting to abusing Depp without remorse.</p>
<p>Heard also has a history of domestic violence, including an arrest for violence against her ex-wife Tasya Van Ree. </p>
<p>There is an outcry among the public saying that if a man had committed these acts, with a history of domestic violence, he would have received much harsher penalties in Hollywood. Just look at what's happened to Johnny Depp based on unsubstantiated accusations.</p>
<p>I think things are going to turn around. I think Heard will face repercussions for her actions, despite her recently acquired motherhood. The public doesn't want to see her in movies, as her recent flop, Gully might testify to. And, sooner or later, the studios are going to have to pay attention. It's the public that pays for tickets. Or, in this case, it's the public who don't. </p>
<p>Heard has a history of domestic abuse. </p>
<p>Johnny Depp is one of the most beloved figures in Hollywood, with a loyal fan base and a history of being a genuinely nice guy. He'll continue to work, and, once he's cleared his name, this nasty business with his ex will be put firmly in his rear view mirror. </p>
<p>Heard may very well never work in Hollywood again.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see.</p>

31,StarterPetitionUpdate,29310494,2021-07-08T21:48:03.000Z,,More calls to fire Amber Heard from AM2,"<p>After it was revealed that work on the next Aquaman sequel had officially commenced, supporters of Johnny Depp relaunched a new Twitter campaign against Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Director James Wan revealed on Monday that production for Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom has begun, 18 months ahead of its December 2022 release date. Wan, who also helmed 2018’s Aquaman, uploaded a photograph of a clapperboard in an ice cave on Instagram with the phrase “day one.”</p>
<p>Instantly, the hashtag #JusticeforJohnnyDepp began trending on Twitter, as Johnny Depp fans voiced their displeasure that Heard is still potentially involved with the project.</p>
<p>There remains doubt among the Twitterverse about the extent of Heard's involvement, however, since she hasn't posted anything on social media about filming. For Aquaman, she posted behind the scenes stuff practically every other day. This time around, nothing. </p>
<p>She's posted plenty from London, with her walking around, visiting restaurants and practicing her abysmal British wannabe accent, but nothing about filming. So some detractors wonder if she's really even involved at all. </p>
<p>But let's assume for the sake of conversation that she is. there are a LOT of people that aren't happy about it. Almost 2 million that I could point at right here on this petition, and there are thousands more out there. Maybe millions. We'll have to wait until December 2022 to find out the extent of Heard's involvement</p>
<p>In the meantime, there's still the matter of Johnny Depp's defamation suit. It remains to be seen what effect the outcome will have on AM2, and on Heard's career, such as it is.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will be heard in April 2022.</p>

One indication of that is that he’s got more than 10 million followers on Instagram, and that number continues to rise. And that’s after sharing only 18 posts.</p>
<p>Another indication of Depp’ popularity is a veritable army of supporters on twitter who continue to share in the actor’s fight to clear his name.</p>
<p>Amber Heard, meanwhile, barely has 4 million followers on Instagram, where she is recently posting pictures and videos of herself with her newly acquired baby.</p>
<p>Depp’s character prior to Heard’s accusations is that of a kind, gentle, loving and generous fellow, and that’s the impression that continues to shine through.</p>
<p>Heard’s character prior to her relationship with Depp is that of someone who’s been arrested for domestic violence with a history of shady motives, and that’s the impression that’s hanging around her, despite new motherhood.</p>
<p>Heard supporters say that Heard’s a mommy now, so the whole thing with Depp should be dropped, and that his supporters should move on. Depp’s supporters, however, insist that he deserves to have his name cleared, and that she should face justice for her misdeeds whether she’s a new mom or not.</p>
<p>Regardless of public opinion either way, the two actors will square off early next year in a defamation case that Depp leveled against Heard after she labeled him as her abuser repeatedly after a divorce settlement that included an NDA.</p>
<p>We’ll just have to wait and see how that goes. And we’ll have to wait and see which of the two really is ready to put the issue to bed and move on, whichever way it comes out.</p>

33,StarterPetitionUpdate,29288233,2021-07-03T15:22:51.000Z,,Baby Backlash,"<p>Two days ago, Amber Heard announced that she has become the mother of a daughter named Oonagh Paige Heard via surrogate. In her announcement, months after the baby’s birth, Heard said: that baby Oonagh is ‘the beginning of the rest of my life’. And the backlash was immediate.</p>
<p>Now, there’s an article titled: Becoming a mother isn’t all about you, Amber Heard. In it, author Amanda Platell calls Heard to task, saying:</p>
<p>“Sorry, what? How about the beginning of someone else’s life? Having a child, Amber, is not about you. It’s about the tiny, helpless person you have chosen to bring into the world. Becoming a mother is the most selfless thing a woman can do. Forgive me if I have my lingering doubts that Amber understands that.”</p>
<p>And many Twitter denizens tend to agree. “Her post was compete all about her,” writes one sceptic. “She can’t hide her narcissism.”</p>
<p>“Me, me, me Heard,” says another.</p>
<p>One Twitter denizen is quick to point out that although the baby was born in April, Heard still hasn’t updated her twitter bio. As of this writing, Heard’s bio says that she’s a(n) “Actor and activist, semi-professional disruptor, ice cream advocate and shameless teacup Yorkie-lover.” Not a word about being a devoted mommy to a sweet little angel.</p>
<p>They get that Heard might have wanted some private time with baby Oonagh before making an announcement to the world, but she’s let the cat out of the bag now, and still not a word in her Twitter bio about her overwhelming joy at welcoming her new bouncing bundle of joy.</p>
<p>Likewise, there’s no category for Heard being a mother on her Instagram account. Just the same tired old categories that have been up forever.</p>
<p>One might argue that she’s too busy to bother with such trivialities, but she hasn’t been too busy to post pictures of herself, or to post the announcement itself.</p>
<p>One might, then, wonder where Heard’s priorities lie.</p>
<p>The day Oonagh was born, Heard posted a video of herself crawling around on the beach in a flimsy sundress, babbling about death threats. One Twitter user was quick to say: “So much concern for her new baby and the woman who actually birthed it.”</p>
<p>Another posted the video from that day with the caption: “The day her baby was born. On the beach Not with her child or surrogate.”</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the majority of the comments on Twitter show concern for a baby being raised by someone with a history of and arrest for domestic violence, posting the hashtag: #SaveBabyHeard.</p>
<p>While this concern is touching, Heard’s history of violence is against adults. She has no public record of a history of violence against children. And, while having a newborn can be a stressful and trying time, it’s almost certain that Heard has a network of nannies and family upon whom she can lean to do most of the heavy lifting. After all, Heard is in London, reportedly filming right now, and there’s no evidence that the baby is with her. There have been lots of photos and videos of Heard out and about in London, but none of them show evidence that she’s got the baby along for the ride. So somebody’s looking after little Oonagh.</p>
<p>So, not to worry. There are probably enough people in baby Oonagh’s life to ensure that she’ll grow up safe and happy. Let's all wish little Oonagh the very best that life has to offer.</p>

<p>People aren't soon to forget that Johnny Depp was removed from the Pirates franchise and fired from Fantastic Beasts while his abuser continues to work. It's a double standard that should and must be rectified.</p>

35,StarterPetitionUpdate,29159471,2021-06-04T15:39:25.000Z,,Heard's Australian Visa may be suspended,"<p>Is Amber Heard still in Aquaman 2? Nobody knows for sure, including possibly Heard herself. She hasn't shared any pre-production tidbits like she did when gearing up for the first one. No costume previews, no workout videos with studio professionals, hada. Her timelines are instead filled with old pictures of herself in precarious positions with questionable attire. </p>
<p>Even IF Warner Bros are still considering Heard for the film, there might be a huge monkey wrench set to be thrown into the works. Heard might lose her Visa to enter Australia, where the first one was filmed (and the second likely will be, too).</p>
<p>Heard, you see, is currently under investigation by the Australian department of agriculture for circumstances surrounding the time when Heard smuggled two teacup Yorkies into the country.</p>
<p>“The department is investigating if any criminal offences under Commonwealth legislation have been committed relating to the testimony provided to the High Court in London. Because of the nature of those enquiries we are unable to provide a timeline,” a departmental spokesperson told news.com.au late last year.</p>
<p>“The Department of Home Affairs has the right to reject any application if the individual is under an investigation by our government,” a representative told us. “Although we cannot go into the specifics of Ms Heard’s case, it is very much a possibility that VISA application may be put on hold until the investigation is over. It just depends of the severity of the offence.”</p>
<p>Providing a false document on entry to Australia under the Migration Act is a serious offence that attracts a maximum penalty of 12 months jail and a fine of $10,200. Furthermore, Heard didn’t just lie on her documents, she also lied to the judge and perjury is a far more serious offence and the maximum penalty is 14 years in jail.</p>
<p>She squeaked out of charges at the time, but those events are being investigated. So it's very possible that her application to travel to Australia will be denied, leaving Heard out in the cold for any filming that takes place there.</p>
<p>Is Heard important enough to the film for them to arrange for alternate locations this late in the game? That's questionable, but we'll have to wait and see. </p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is slated to start filming either this month or next (June or July 2021). </p>

Well, her lawyer says no.</p>
<p>The “Aquaman” star’s lawyer said the Los Angeles Police Department is not looking into if she faked injuries during an alleged altercation between herself and ex-husband Johnny Depp during a hearing in his case against her. The statute of limitations has run out for that incident to be investigated, she insists. </p>
<p>I'm no law expert, I'll admit, but I've heard it said that it's not 3 years from the date of the incident that constitutes the statute. They say that the clock starts ticking when the authorities become aware of the perjury. </p>
<p>I don't know which scenario is true, but we'll see.</p>
<p>It seems to me, though, that if the statute of limitations were up, the LAPD wouldn't bother starting an investigation, and they know a lot more about it than me. </p>
<p>We can add this investigation, if there is one, to the pile of Heard's legal woes. She's reportedly still under investigation for <a href=""https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/amber-heard-facing-perjury-charges-in-australia-over-dog-smuggling/WTF4PC42UJM5PUWNMDPWFWLMKE/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">perjury in Australia</a> regarding an incident where she smuggled the couple's dogs into the country in violation of Australia's bio-laws. </p>
<p>And let's not forget Johnny Depp's case against her for defamation, as if we could forget. There are hearings for motions scheduled along the way, but the main event is due to start in April of 2022. That's when it's really going to hit the fan.</p>
<p>If the public thought that the libel case against the Sun was a circus, they haven't seen anything yet. The only evidence that was relevant in the Sun case was admitted as it related to the libel case. </p>
<p>In the Defamation case, EVERYTHING comes into play. And make no mistake, there's evidence we haven't even heard of yet. The Eastern Columbia building, where the couple lived, has CCtv security cameras that capture everything. There are stories about Heard chasing Depp out into the hall. If that happened, there's footage of it. Not to mention whatever men might have visited Heard in the penthouse when Depp was away working. Including what times they arrived and left. </p>
<p>Plus, there's the incident where Heard accused Depp of spilling wine all up and down the hallway in a fit of rage. If that happened, it'll be on camera, too. If not, the unblinking eye of the camera will show the truth of what happened that night. Including who was where, and when. Did the other penthouse denizens pass Depp's security to get into PH3? If not, they had to have come in through the adjoining penthouse, which screams setup, and blatantly contradicts their testimony.</p>
<p>Let's see those Toronto tapes. </p>
<p>Let's hear more of those recorded conversations. </p>
<p>Let's see it ALL. </p>
<p>Oh, yes. There's so much more to come. </p>
<p>Point being, Heard's legal woes might not be over with Johnny's defamation case, win or lose. She still stands to face investigations in two countries for statements her mouth made that reality might not be able to back up</p>

<p>In the meantime, the public are making their opinions known about a film with Heard in it, as there are far more dislikes clicked for the trailer than likes Don't take my word for it. See for yourself, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twT_gV7H_1Q&amp;t=6s"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>As for Heard's upcoming roles, according to IMDB, there are only the doomed ""Run away with me"" and Aquaman 2, which seems dubious at best. We'll have to wait and see if more roles come her way. </p>
<p>Heard's future in film might rely heavily on the outcome of ex-husband Johnny Depp's defamation suit against her, and investigations in two countries against her for perjury. Depending on how those go, it might be quite some time before we see Amber Heard on film again.</p>

According to those sources, Heard has wanted to become involved with the Harry Potter franchise for some time, but wouldn’t broach the idea as long as ex-husband Johnny Depp was involved. Now that he’s been booted, she has the freedom to angle for a role.</p>
<p>They didn’t say what role Heard might be after, or even what part of the franchise she’s interested in. It could be a future film, or a highly anticipated Harry Potter series rumored to be coming our way via HBO. Who knows?</p>
<p>A series would give her potential longevity instead of a single movie appearance, and it would maintain some distance from the elements of the franchise that Johnny Depp was associated with.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not Warmer Bros wants to continue working with Heard, as her relationship with the upcoming Aquaman sequel is dubious at best. According to <a href=""https://poptopic.com.au/rumour/amber-heard-allegedly-has-not-been-contacted-about-aquaman-2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Poptopik</a>, she allegedly hasn’t even been called for AM2, and it’s supposed to start filming in just over a month.

<p>Amber Heard said: ""I had bruised ribs, bruises all over my body (...), two blue eyes, a broken nose, a cracked lip"" But these photos show Heard with no marks on her and a pristine skin. No bruises where those broken ribs would have been, no busted lip, and no contusions on her face that would be evident after such a savage beating.</p>
<p>BILD asked emergency phisician Prof. Peter Sefrin, member of the DKR Presidium: ""Both a broken nose and bruised ribs cause very severe pain. You don't necessarily see it on the outside, but the nose has to be operated if it's broken, a bruised rib only starts to heal after 14 days.""</p>
<p>NOTABLE: There is no medical certificate or X-rays of the broken nose from the incident of the alleged abuse on Dec 15th, 2015.<br>Amber's private nurse , who she called in two days after the incident, testified at the time that she could not see any visible injuries.</p>
<p>BILD asked Amber's Attorney Elaine Bredehoft to comment. She said Bild should look into the London Court ruling that supports AMber's account of the mistreatment and her explanation for contradiction of going onto private trip shortly afterwards: ""All the evidence has already been fully considered"".</p>
<p>Trouble is, these photos weren’t available at the London trial, or the outcome might have been very different. They will be available for the VA defamation trial, though.</p>

<p>Originally reported in the German news outlet BILD, the story is being picked up and spread around by American sources as well. This is good news in and of itself. </p>
<p>The press so far has been decidedly pro-Heard, posting every little thing she says and does, painting her in a favorable light, while largely refusing to print anything remotely favorable to Heard's ex husband, Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The two are embroiled in litigation that's already gone on as many as 3 years, and promises to continue into years to come. The two will face off in court in Fairfax, VA starting in April of 2022 in Johnny Depp's defamation suit against Heard. There's no telling how long that will take to play out. </p>
<p>One thing's for sure, though, it's going to be informative. CCTV footage of everything that happens in the hallways of the Eastern Columbia building in LA is recorded by security cameras. That, of course, is where the couple lived at the time of their explosive falling out. So, Heard's claims of Depp's behavior could very bell be confirmed or debunked by the building's own security cameras. </p>
<p>One claim has already been given a new light. Bodycam footage from two of the officers responding to 911 calls was recently released, showing no damage to the apartment, including the door, that Heard had previously claimed. </p>
<p>It remains to be seen what evidence will be forthcoming for the defamation trial, but I'm willing to bet it'll be newsworthy.</p>
<p>And with the media showing a willingness to report stories that may favor Depp, we'll be able to follow it in the media. Hopefully by then, it'll be completely acceptable to cover pro-Depp stories as well. </p>

<p>Okay.. a quick Google says that ""Perjury is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three or four years.""</p>

43,StarterPetitionUpdate,28983302,2021-05-02T19:01:50.000Z,,It Ain't Over Til It's Over,"<p>As of a few days ago, rumor from a trusted source has it that Amber Heard will, indeed, be appearing in Aquaman 2. This information has struck a lot of Johnny Depp supporters hard, because it seems like she can get away with whatever she wants and keep getting roles in blockbuster films. </p>
<p>But there's more to the story.</p>
<p>For one thing, there are millions of people bombarding @WBPictures on Twitter with their disdain for this decision. Amber Heard seems to get away with being this massive abuser and doesn't get fired, while Johnny Depp, who is overwhelmingly innnocent, gets canned from two major franchises. The Travesty! These millions promise to #BoycottAquaman2 and there are whispers of demonstrations at both the filming locations and the movie's premiers in assorted countries. </p>
<p>So things don't look so hot for WB for hiring Amber Heard back after reportedly buying out her contract so that she wouldn't be in it.</p>
<p>Plus, there are still legal woes plaguing Amber Heard. And, no. I don't just mean the defamation case brought against her buy Johnny Depp, which is set to begin in April of 2022.</p>
<p>Nope. I'm talking about Amber Heard reportedly being investigated by the Australian government for perjury in association with smuggling two dogs into Australia contrary to Oz's biosecurity laws. </p>
<p>That's nothing new, I know. It's been going around for years that they're looking at her for that, seemingly with no end in sight.</p>
<p>What's new is a claim by a Youbuter named <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=That+umbrella+guy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">That Umbrella Guy</a> that the FBI has been contacted to assist with the investigation. If that's true, it puts things in a whole different light. The penalty for perjury in Australia could land Heard as many as 14 years in jail, hefty fines, and possibly being banned from Australia for a number of years. </p>
<p>While it's disturbingly unlikely that Heard will do any jail time (though many of her detractors hope she will), being banned from the country could affect filming schedules from any movie being produced there.</p>
<p>Including Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>It's been said by cast and crew that AM2 will begin filming in London in June, 2021, but that's likely for the indoor scenes. It's very possible that the outside scenes will be filmed in Australia, like they were for AM1.</p>
<p>If that's the case, Heard would not be able to film in Australia. Granted, there may be legal loopholes they can jump through to make it possible, since the film is a preexisting project, or some such, but it presents an ever-growing headache for any studio that considers working with her in the future. Time will have to tell that tale.</p>
<p>Regardless, whatever happens in court, and in Australia, Johnny Depp's popularity and productivity continue to soar, while Heard's public opinion seems to be waning. </p>
<p>Will Heard be able to repair her public image? A LOT of people, myself included, doubt it sincerely, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>On the night of the blowout fight, a friend of Heard, who asked to remain anonymous had dialed 911, claiming that the actress was being ‘assaulted’ by her boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Hi, I need to report an assault right now happening at 849 Broadway at the Eastern building, it’s penthouse three,” the female caller says in the recording, referring to the luxurious home the former couple previously shared in downtown LA.</p>
<p>“I happen to know that it’s happening and I just need to remain anonymous,” she added.</p>
<p>“So what did she say that this guy assaulted her or hit her?” the LAPD operator replies, explaining she needs more detail.</p>
<p>“Physically assaulting her, yeah,” replies the caller ”Send somebody up there please,” the caller pleads, reiterating the location of the couple’s penthouse before the call abruptly ends.</p>
<p>Another 911 call was made by Heard’s friend iO Tillet Wright.</p>
<p>That means that two sets of officers responded to the scene. And both sets of officers have insisted from day one that they saw no evidence of violence, not on Heard’s face, and not in the condo.</p>
<p>Up until now, it’s been a matter of he say/she say, leaving judges, journalists, and the public to decide who to believe.</p>
<p>But now, the debate is over. In bodycam footage from the second set of officers, the condo is clearly seen as being tidy and undamaged. You can read the article from the Daily Mail <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9474979/Johnny-Depp-says-police-bodycam-footage-PROVES-Amber-Heard-lying.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Depp’s attorney Adam Wadman says the footage proves that there was never any wrecking spree and that Heard’s account of the evening cannot be believed.</p>
<p>“Amber Heard and her friends described a chaotic, messy crime scene but the newly released LAPD bodycam videos unambiguously show that the penthouse was utterly undamaged and that their testimony was one more grandiose lie,” Waldman told DailyMail.com in a statement.</p>
<p>Depp and Heard will square off in April, 2022 in a defamation suit that Depp filed against his ex-wife. It remains to be seen how this new footage will affect the proceedings, but it doesn’t look good for Heard.</p>
<p>It also remains to be seen if this new evidence will inspire perjury charges in previously offered court testimony in Depp’s recent libel suit against NGN and the Sun tabloid in the UK. That’s where Heard described the chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Heard is currently being investigated for perjury charges in Australia for testimony surrounding an incident in which Heard smuggled the couple’s dogs into Australia in violation of quarantine laws.</p>
<p>It’s possible that these mounting legal woes will affect Heard’s appearance in any upcoming projects, and could potentially land her jail time. Time will tell the extent to which this new evidence, and Depp’s impending slander suit will affect Amber Heard.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard shrug this evidence off? Or is this the mic drop moment for Depp in his quest to vindicate himself?</p>

Unlike Atlantis, its placement is unstable, meaning the location of the city constantly changes, never to be found in the same place twice. Apparently. So, while the working title could just be a fun nod to lore, it could also mean Arthur may interact, or even fight, Mongo. It’s safe to say that Black Manta will return as Aquaman’s nemesis.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa will return as the titular character, and despite fans’ protestations, Amber Heard is still clutching the notion that she will once again be the queen of the deep. However, there’s also been constant speculation that a new major female character is being written into the script, as a means to both increase diversity among the ensemble and reduce Heard’s screen time in the event of a worst case scenario. WB has yet to confirm that, but insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that Aquaman 2 will have four female leads, though the tipster doesn’t offer any further details to elaborate on his intel.</p>
<p>Heard’s Mera, the aforementioned mystery character and Nicole Kidman’s returning Queen Atlanna will presumably make up 75% of the quartet, leaving one position unfilled. But with filming set to start a mere two months away, we should start to get some answers soon, both about the new mystery character and Heard’s dubious chances of returning as the film’s primary female lead.</p>

50,StarterPetitionUpdate,28770580,2021-03-25T10:25:22.000Z,,Appeal denied,"<p>Johnny Depp has FAILED in his application to appeal the libel judgment which found The Sun newspaper’s allegation he engaged in domestic violence against Amber Heard was “substantially true”.</p>
<p>Rubbish. I'd like to use a stronger word, but refrain.</p>
<p>As much as this is a blow to Johnny Depp, it's more of a defeat for male victims of domestic violence, particularly in the UK. This kind of finding tells them that, no. they won't be believed, so just shut up and take it, and don't you dare speak up. It shouldn't be that way. I must change.</p>
<p>The thing to remember at this point is that this verdict is not a win for Amber Heard. This case wasn't against her. It was against NGN and the Sun.</p>
<p>What we can do now is look forward to the Defamation trial in VA. That one is directly between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. I'm a little nervous about that one because Heard never named Depp in her WaPo OpEd, the reason he finally sued her. On that basis alone, it could very well go her way, even though it's obvious who she was talking about. </p>
<p>But no matter how it goes, the truth about Heard will come out. There's evidence we haven't even seen yet. No matter how court goes, she loses in the court of public opinion, which will directly impact upon her career. Let's remember that she doesn't have any active projects coming up while Johnny Depp and his production company is directly involved with no fewer than 20 projects coming up. </p>
<p>This decision today is beyond ridiculous but it's one battle, not the war. Let's try to stay positive and look forward to the Virginia trial. It's a different court, a different case, and is more than likely to come out a different way. </p>

55,StarterPetitionUpdate,28633362,2021-03-01T18:23:47.000Z,,Amber Heard facing jail time?,"<p>According to <a href=""https://www.distractify.com/p/is-amber-heard-going-to-jail"" rel=""nofollow"">Distractify</a>, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail time if the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor.</p>
<p>Amber Heard could be going to jail if Johnny Depp wins his lawsuit.<br>Basically, Amber Heard claimed on the stand in Johnny’s libel suit against the Sun tabloid that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused her.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, Heard showed up in court with a black eye seeking a restraining order. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this. She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.”</p>
<p>Since then, Johnny Depp has fought back against every bad word against him with libel and defamation lawsuits, so far against The Sun (which he lost), and against Amber Heard, which has not yet been seen in court. According to Deadline, the latest update is that their court date is once again pushed back to at least April 11, 2022. If Amber Heard loses, she could face jail time for tampering with evidence.</p>
<p>Even though it’s possible Johnny Depp could win his upcoming lawsuit in the coming years, there’s no confirming whether or not Amber Heard will face jail time. Regardless, this puts Warner Bros. in a tough spot. Even though fans had petitioned for Warner Bros. to force Amber Heard’s resignation from Aquaman 2, WB hasn’t announced any plans for change.</p>
<p>However, in December 2020, a lifestyle article in Forbes about Emilia Clarke’s home let the cat out of the bag that Emilia Clarke had signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in Aquaman 2. Sadly, though, there’s still no confirmation. It could just be wishful thinking on the fans’ part.</p>
<p>It’s not clear according to that article why Amber Heard could be facing jail time if Johnny Depp wins his appeal. They mention tampering with evidence, but don’t say clearly what evidence, or how it was tampered with.</p>
<p>I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that if Johnny wins his appeal, Heard might be on the hook for some very serious perjury charges. She’s already being investigated in Australia for Perjury charges for falsifying statements about smuggling their dogs Pistol and Boo into the country. So it wouldn’t be a far stretch if she’s investigated in a London court for the same crime. Not for lying about the dogs, this time, though, but for potentially lying on the stand during Johnny’s libel case against NGN and the Sun tabloid.</p>
<p>It could be for something else altogether.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that there’s no statute of limitations in Australia for grievous bodily injury requiring medical attention. And that’s where Heard cut off the tip of Johnny’s finger with a Vodka bottle. And, no. I’m not making a wild accusation there. Heard herself was recorded on audiotape admitting that she did, saying “I didn’t mean to do it!” and begging Johnny not to leave her.</p>
<p>The point being, if Johnny wanted to, he could always file a report with Australian police and have her put behind bars for a long time. And if her were the vengeful monster she keeps trying to say he is, he would have done that already.</p>
<p>All Johnny’s interested in is clearing his name. He’s said it time and time again, and the fact that Heard’s not cooling her heels already in an Australian prison proves it.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard face jail time if Johnny wins his appeal? Or if he wins his defamation suit? Should Johnny press charges in Australia over his severed finger?</p>
<p>Yeah. I do too.</p>","{'id': '225270885', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/yp/om/ahyPoMgOnXIvGwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614623031', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
56,StarterPetitionUpdate,28619185,2021-02-26T19:57:00.000Z,,Amber Heard Physically unfit?,"<p>It’s looking more and more like Amber Heard really won’t be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>This petition has reported long since that Heard’s contract has been bought out by WB and that she won’t appear in Aquaman 2. But the masses want proof, rightfully so. Well, the more time goes by, the more it looks like we might actually have been properly informed.</p>
<p>It’s being reported lately that Emilia Clarke might have signed on to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. But, again, there’s no confirmation, though an article in Forbes seems to be as legit a source as it gets. So we can’t be sure about that part of the speculation about Amber Heard’s dubious future in AM2.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>Recently, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf2AgE2eE8M"" rel=""nofollow"">Popcorned Planet</a>’s Andy Signore went on record saying: “The part of this story that is true is that, yes, Amber Heard is fired from Aquaman 2. Now, from what I’ve heard so far she’s been fired from Aquaman 2. From what I’ve heard through a source, though other people that are involved in the production is that it already happened.”</p>
<p>Previously, we’ve heard that WB bought out Heard’s contract because she might not be bondable (due to alcohol and drug use, perhaps?). If she can’t be insured for the duration of filming, she can’t film.</p>
<p>But the reason might be something completely different than what we thought.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/movies/amber-heard-aquaman-2-contract-terminated-for-health-fitness-reasons/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sausage Roll</a>, Amber Heard might not appear in AM2 because she ‘s not physically fit enough. They say: “Amber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She’s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.”</p>
<p>True to form, Heard manages to blame Johnny Depp for it, throwing Covid in for good measure. “Heard allegedly blamed Johnny Depp and COVID-19 for her deteriorating health, saying that she’s been under tremendous amount of stress and has been suffering from depression but she insists that she will get back in shape.”</p>
<p>Filming for Aquaman 2 is set to start filming in June (2021), so it remains to be seen whether or not she’ll get back in shape. We’ll also have to wait and see if she is, or becomes, bondable for filming.</p>
<p>That seems like a lot to happen in just a few months.</p>
<p>Also, according to another industry insider, Heard may have failed to report an injury. If she were injured, failed to report it and got further injured during training, which is quite rigorous, the studio would have been on the hook for it. So, it's entirely possible that this is the nature of Heard being physically unfit.</p>
<p>Whichever the reason it seems more likely than not that the rumors about Amber Heard not appearing in AM2 are true. I don’t know whether it will Emelia Clarke or not that takes over, but I’m totally on board with it if it is.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard fit back into the fish suit again or will we see somebody else taking over screen time in AM2?</p>

57,StarterPetitionUpdate,28613653,2021-02-25T21:01:42.000Z,,Johnny Depp pissed off?,"<p>The latest story coming from leaker Daniel Richtman is saying that <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/johnny-depp-reportedly-furious-amber-heard-job-offers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Johnny Depp is furious</a> that his ex-wife Amber Heard’s star appears to be rising as his falls. According to Richtman Depp is “pissed” that she keeps getting work.</p>
<p>Heard recently appeared in CBS’ The Stand and is about to film Aquaman 2 despite multiple <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/petition-amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-closing-2m-signatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">fan campaigns</a> trying to get her fired (Mera will also play a minor role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League next month, a movie that’s already been filmed).</p>
<p>But it’s the latest rumor doing the rounds that must seriously enrage Depp, as reports say that Heard is in contention to portray <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-reportedly-play-liveaction-rapunzel-disney/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rapunzel</a> in Disney’s live-action version of Tangled.</p>
<p>The actress potentially being hired by the House of Mouse for a big role just as they drop Depp from his most iconic part (Captain Jack Sparrow, of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) must really stick in his craw.</p>
<p>But this story isn’t over yet, as Depp is mounting an appeal to the verdict in his failed libel suit against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, and there are lawsuits filed in Virginia that could go more favorably for him.</p>
<p>Still, According to Richtman, right now, Heard is going from strength-to-strength and Johnny Depp is suffering major career damage. So even if he’s eventually vindicated, he might never again be the A-lister he once was.</p>
<p>Where to start.</p>
<p>First, the sober truth is that Heard is a little long in the tooth to portray a Disney princess. Those girls are usually in their mid-teens, and Heard is twice that age now. It’s highly unlikely that she’s up for any such part.</p>
<p>Second, after Heard has pestered Disney with subpoenas and legal shenanigans, it’s not likely at all that they would line up to sign her for anything, let alone a role half her age.</p>
<p>Third, Johnny is not hurting for work. If you look at Depp’s <a href=""https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000136?rf=cons_nm_meter&amp;ref_=cons_nm_meter"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB pro</a> page, he’s lined up to be involved with more than twenty projects.</p>
<p>Heard has <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" rel=""nofollow"">2 projects</a> on her books. Aquaman 2, which she probably won’t appear in. Strong rumor has it that Emilia Clark will replace Heard in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>The other project is “Run away with me” a project which was abandoned years ago. Two movies she will most likely not even appear in. That’s it. That’s all she’s got scheduled for future projects.</p>
<p>Finally, but not least, it’s looking more and more like Johnny Depp is going to be vindicated in both court proceedings, leaving him in a much more favorable position than Heard.</p>
<p>So it’s not quite as bleak for Depp as Richtman would have you believe. Either his information is faulty or he’s just plain wrong.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard’s star rising? Or is Depp coming out on top?</p>","{'id': '225257223', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/pj/sq/bdpJsQhkPxDtqNI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614286904', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
58,StarterPetitionUpdate,28602060,2021-02-24T00:26:36.000Z,,Trial date pushed back,"<p>The defamation suit Johnny Depp took out against his ex wife Amber Heard was scheduled to on May 7th, 2021. But, probably due to Covid, the trial date has been pushed back to April 11th, 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that Johnny will get word back about his appeal to overturn the verdict in his libel suit against NGN and The Sun tabloid before he even sets foot in the courtroom for his defamation suit against Heard. He might be vindicated on the British front first.</p>
<p>Heard has been worried in the past about how the defamation suit will affect her filming schedule. But if she's found to have lied in a British court, and if Australia has their way about her lying in one of their courts, her filming schedule might be the last thing she'll have to worry about. </p>
<p>Instead, the courts might have to figure out how to het her from jail to the courtroom. That could make for some interesting travel plans.</p>
<p>Somehow, I doubt that the flight they'd put her on would have Champaign and caviar.  </p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard go to jail for lying to a British High Court? Or will she get out of it somehow?</p>

59,StarterPetitionUpdate,28560793,2021-02-16T19:45:28.000Z,,Amber Heard a Disney Princess?,"<p>According to ""Insider"" Daniel Richtman, Amber heard is in talks with the House of Mouse about playing a live-action Disney princess.</p>
<p><a href=""https://insidethemagic.net/2021/02/amber-heard-tangled-ad1/"" rel=""nofollow"">One article</a> says that she's negotiating to play princess Rapunzel in Tangled. <a href=""https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/amber-heard-disney-princess.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Another one</a> backs it up.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how seriously to take these revelations. </p>
<p>First, there's the messy legal battle that's warring between Amber Heard and her ex-husband Johnny Depp. It's a sordid affair, and Heard has dragged Disney into it by demanding a plethora of documents from them, pretty much any dealing they ever had with Johnny Depp, his schedule, his contracts, his alleged drug use or bad behavior on the set, anything she can get her hands on.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that Disney would be too quick to negotiate with somebody who's causing them so many legal woes.</p>
<p>And second, there's the demographic of Disney princesses. Traditionally, Disney princesses are in their mid-teens, just coming into their own. Amber Heard is 34 years old, and not getting any younger. That's just about twice the age of the average Disney princess. </p>
<p>I suppose it's not impossible that Heard could be in talks with Disney to portray a princess, but I think it's highly unlikely.</p>
<p>A lot of frivolous press has been floating around about Heard lately, but I personally think that this is among the more amusing. </p>
<p>What do you think? Would Amber Heard personify a Disney princess? Or has the time for kind of role come and long gone for her?</p>","{'id': '225220517', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/lw/xn/KIlwxNJYTqhbTMN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613504731', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
60,StarterPetitionUpdate,28555166,2021-02-15T20:49:24.000Z,,Amber Heard wants Aquaman 3,"<p>Often when putting together a franchise, the powers that be offer the principal players a three picture deal. That cuts down on scheduling conflicts and keeps actors from negotiating for a better deal in-between each picture. But that’s not always the case. Just as often, they take it one film at a time.</p>
<p>In the case of the Aquaman franchise, it looks like they opted to do one film at a time. If that is indeed the case, no actor is guaranteed a part in the second or third installment.</p>
<p>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Amber Heard is already scrambling to try to secure her place in Aquaman 3, even though AM2 hasn’t even begun to film yet.</p>
<p>There are doubts about whether or not Heard will even appear in AM2. Almost 2 million people have made it clear that they don’t want to see Amber Heard in any further AM films, and it’s possible that WB is paying attention. One rumor has it that Heard’s screen time in AM2 is being severely curtailed, with another female lead taking on more screen time.</p>
<p>Other rumors whisper that Heard’s contract has been bought out, meaning that while Heard got paid, she will not appear in the film at all.</p>
<p>There are several factors that will likely determine whether Heard comes back in any subsequent Aquaman films. First, there are the court cases going back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. Depp is suing Heard for Defamation for portraying him as a domestic abuser who physically abused and terrorized her throughout their marriage. Depp is having none of that is on a legal crusade to clear his good name and prove that it was Heard who was the abuser the entire time. Heard has a lot of sob storied and the support of her friends to back up her abuse storied, while Depp has video and audio recordings of her admitting to abusing him. Unlike Heard, Depp also has medical evidence, including a fingertip that got severed and a burn on his cheek from a cigarette being put out on his face.</p>
<p>The two are also embroiled in litigation in England from a libel case that Depp leveled against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, for calling Depp a wife-beater. Initially, the judgement favored the Sun, who repeated that wife-beater claim again. But Depp is appealing the verdict, and will likely prevail.</p>
<p>If these two cases go Depp’s way, it doesn’t bode well for Heard’s continued presence in the AM franchise. Most films have a morals clause in their contracts, and if Heard is proven to be a domestic abuser again, that clause might very well be invoked.</p>
<p>I say “again” because Heard was arrested in 2009 for domestic abuse against her then wife Tasya Van Ree.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of whether or not Heard is bondable. That is to say, whether or not she can be insured for the duration of filming. If she can’t be insured for any reason, like a preexisting medical condition, excessive drug or alcohol abuse, she can’t and won’t be hired for any future AM project.</p>
<p>Heard supporters insist that she’ll be in AM2 and 3 because there hasn’t been any official announcement from WB about her being dropped. But that’s not the way it works. If Heard has been dropped, there likely won’t be any announcement. The movie will simply come out without her in it. So fans who want her dropped who are waiting for an announcement won’t get one. We’ll just have to wait for the film to come out to see whether she’s in it or not.</p>
<p>Time will have to tell whether or not Amber Heard is in Aquaman 2, let alone Aquaman 3. We’ll have to wait and see how those court cases come out, and whether or not Heard is bondable. As ever, I’ll bring you the latest as I find it.</p>

61,StarterPetitionUpdate,28550493,2021-02-14T20:58:00.000Z,,Amber Heard is a nobody,"<p>Amber Heard is a nobody, at least according to Amber Heard. In one of her latest court filings, Amber has a fit about people calling her that.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard filed in her original $100 million dollar counterclaim to Johnny Depp’s $50 million dollar defamation suit against her, that there was an army of bots under Depp’s command torturing her. Even creating and/or signing this very petition. An investigation found less than a dozen questionable Twitter accounts that might be bots, blowing that claim out of the water.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Heard has shoved forward, trying to obtain personal data about 200 Twitter users, to prove that they’re bots and not real people, I guess.</p>
<p>Now, she’s down to two. TWO people that she’s upset at for: 1) saying they’re proud of Johnny Depp for fighting to clear his name, and 2) refer to the defendant (Heard), a movie star, as “a nobody.” And she had to put that in there, that she’s “a movie star.” She needed to point that out, I suppose, in case anybody forgets that she got lucky off the back of being married to Johnny Depp and scored Aquaman. Would she have gotten that movie on her own? Anybody? Bueller?</p>
<p>She’s throwing everything she can at the wall with regards to Twitter users, hoping that something will stick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of the statements she’s throwing around by Twitter fans are protected opinions of celebrities. People just don’t like her, and there’s not one single thing she can do about it.</p>
<p>What I suspect, however, is that she doesn’t really expect any of this Twitter bluster to stick to the wall. I think it’s a diversionary tactic, intended to direct attention away from the avalanche of evidence Johnny Depp has that’s bearing down on her.</p>
<p>And it works. For a minute. But she’s deluding only herself if she thinks that the people who support Johnny Depp are about to lose sight of the big picture. They might point fingers and laugh at her folly when she tries some new antic, but they’re steadfast to the case at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>What will she pull next? What new filing will she throw at the court to try to filibuster her way out of the inevitable? We’ll have to wait and see. One thing that’s sure is that it’ll bring out more finger pointing and giggles, at least until the final verdicts come down. Then it will be Johnny Depp that gets the last laugh.</p>

You know, the one where Heard claimed that Depp struck her in the face with a phone.</p>
<p>iO has been very vocal in his support of Heard, claiming to bear witness to the after-effects of many violent episodes where Heard said that Depp brutalized her. Blood on a pillow, hair on the floor, that sort of thing. Mind you, iO never witnessed any violence, just saw that (staged?) scene afterwards.</p>
<p>Now, iO is trying to quash the subpoena calling for him to appear for a deposition.</p>
<p>In his motion to quash, iO says: “I am not a party to the above-referenced actions. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would completely do so.”</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“I have never been served with any subpoena in this action (Case No. 19stcp04763) or in the Virginia Fairfax County Court Action (Case no. CL-2019-0002911). Rather, I understand that Mr. Depp’s lawyers emailed copies of the subpoena to my lawyer, Lee Brenner, on January 20, 2021.”</p>
<p>“I do not reside at the address of 6144 Panorama Street, Joshua Tree, CA 92252, and I have never resided at that address. I have no ownership interest in that address.”</p>
<p>I understand that a man named Anthony was at the address that day, and I have spoken to him. He said that he spoke to a process server that day (Jan 19, 2021) who left a pile of papers on the front step.”</p>
<p>“I declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.”</p>
<p>“Executed this 8th day of February 2021, and Joshua Tree, California.”</p>
<p>And he signed it.</p>
<p>Further: “Here, Mr. Wright was not served with the subpoena at issue. See Wright Cecl. At ¶ 3-5. First, he does not reside at the address listed on the Subpoena nor does he have any ownership interest in that address. Id., at ¶3, Mr. Wright has spoken with a man named Anthony who was at the address listed on the “proof of service” on January 19 2021 and was told that a process server left a pile of papers on the front step. Id., at ¶5. Mr. Wright does not know why anyone would say that they served him because they simply did not. Id., at ¶ 4. In the light of the foregoing, the subpoenas are procedurally defective and should be quashed.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>First, if iO has no ownership or interest in that address, how does he know who was there on that day or any other? He clearly knows more than he's letting on, to have spoken with a man he says was there that day.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t care one way or another where iO lives, but this just doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>What’s iO so scared of that he’s trying to dodge his subpoena? Is he afraid that the hoax is finally going to catch up with him and that he could face charges of perjury if he lies to an American court? Fines can be hefty, and jail isn’t exactly kind to trans persons.</p>
<p>Maybe the time has come for iO to reconsider his position in the Amber Heard fiasco. Because, dodge as he might, that subpoena is going to catch up to him, like it or not.</p>

64,StarterPetitionUpdate,28508017,2021-02-07T17:17:38.000Z,,Russian Bots sign the Petition,"<p>In an interesting turn of events, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">new video</a> has surfaced of somebody using Russian bots to sign the petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">the video</a>, a nameless, faceless person uses a Russian website to create over 2,000 signatures.</p>
<p>According to the video’s creator, for over 16 hours his bot signed the petition over 2,000 times. It can do 3,000 a day from ONE bot channel and infinitely more from multiple channels.</p>
<p>The fact that the bots in this case are being made to look Russian in origin plays right into Amber Heard's narrative that all or most of the signatures on the petition are fake. And it's important that they're of Russian origin, since great measures were taken to try to tie them to Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp's lawyer and friend.</p>
<p>According to this article: ""The bot’s Russian origin is a crucial aspect of this story. Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp’s attorney who was barred from his upcoming libel case in the United States, is a former lobbyist for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire, and Kremlin insider. It’s believed by some he was involved with or has insider knowledge, of the 2016 hacking of the US election.""</p>
<p>Laying it on really thick in the anti-Waldman crusade.</p>
<p>In recent history, two things have apparently bothered Amber Heard: Adam Waldman and this petition. She took care of Waldman by successfully lobbying to get him removed from Johnny Depp's upcoming Fairfax defamation case against Amber Heard. That backfired, though, since removing Waldman from the case left him free to discuss the case freely. And he has been. Check out <a href=""https://twitter.com/adam_waldman"" rel=""nofollow"">Waldman's Twitter</a> feed to read some delightful insights into the case.</p>
<p>And it's obvious that the petition bothers Heard, who mentions it prominently in her $100 million dollar countersuit.</p>
<p>It's not the first time action has been taken to try and get the petition removed. Not long ago, negative comments were posted on the petition, and then reported as violations to try to get the petition taken down.</p>
<p>That didn't work, and this isn't going to, either. I've already been in contact with Change.org, and rest assured. The petition is quite safe.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp has a hearing on 18 March regarding his appeal in the UK libel case against the Sun, and the defamation suit in Fairfax is due to start in May - if it's not pushed back due to Covid.</p>
<p>With these cases looming so large, it's possible that more shenanigans will pop up trying to further discredit Adam Waldman and attack the petition. Hopefully, both of these cases will reach fruition soon, and the matter can be decided, once and for all. </p>
<p>How do you think these cases will play out? Will Johnny Depp get justice? Or will Amber Heard prevail?</p>

For instance, Aquaman 2 could recast the entire ensemble from top to bottom and people would still be willing to check it out, as long as Jason Momoa remained on board as Arthur Curry.</p>
<p>Of course, there’ve been a lot of fans threatening to boycott the DCEU sequel entirely based on Amber Heard’s continued involvement in the underwater adventures, although she doesn’t care in the slightest and can’t wait to suit up as Mera again. However, there are reports making the rounds that a new female lead is being introduced as well, one that could potentially reduce Heard’s screen time in the finished product depending on how her next court case opposite ex-husband Johnny Depp plays out.</p>
<p>On that note, insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that the actress is furious after catching wind of the decision, and isn’t happy with Warner Bros. trying to essentially force her out of the spotlight as the female lead of the highest-grossing DC Comics adaptation in history. </p>
<p>We might take this report with a grain of salt, though, considering insiders in the industry have been saying for months that Heard won't be in Aquaman 2 at all. </p>
<p>Sources say that WB has bought out Heard's contract completely. That means that she'll be compensated for her contract without actually appearing in the film. </p>

She’s tying herself to Wood, including them together in her claims railing against men she seems to allege are getting away with abusing women, calling out the media, saying: “...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan &amp; I aren’t the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?”</p>
<p>It seems that Heard went on a bender last night, posting about how the media seems to be ignoring Marilyn Manson after Wood’s allegations.</p>
<p>What it’s got to do with her, one has to wonder. There are some Johnny Depp fans that really don’t want to see Johnny dragged through the mud in the Manson case, but it seems that Heard is desperate to make sure that he is, by association.</p>
<p>In her meltdown, at one point, Heard goes off on somebody that calls her a fraud, telling them to shut up if they haven’t been in a situation where they were being strangled and fighting for their life. And, true to fashion, she did it using the tweenspeak trend of using numbers to abbreviate words, making it that much harder to take her accusations and vitriol seriously.</p>
<p>Is she now saying that she herself has been strangled? Are these new allegations she’s coming up with against Johnny Depp, or did she at one point say that he was strangling her while he was brutalizing her. Is that part of the testimony she gave behind closed doors? Or was that “just” about being brutally raped? Is there anything she won’t come up with to throw at Johnny Depp to try and make her case stick?</p>
<p>In another post, she continues her rage against rich white men, which some might say is rather ironic since those have been the type of men she’s spent her intimate time with. Or, perhaps she’s just talking about the ones that have rejected her.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard’s former assistant Kate James revealed that Heard stole her story of being raped. Is she now appropriating Wood’s story about being strangled?</p>

<p>Heard amusingly refer to Johnny Depp fans as Wald-Mignons - referring to Depp's lawyer and friend Adam Waldman. I'm pretty sure she meant minions, but fell flat with the intended slight. One fan responded that Mignon actually means cute or pretty, ""...so, thanks.""</p>
<p>It seems that Heard is desperate at this point, especially with Depp’s appeal in the UK case looming so near in the future. We all thought we’d have to wait up to two years to hear anything else about that, but here it is, with a huge milestone in the case happening just next month.</p>
<p>Yes, she seems desperate. And with what could be a huge victory for Depp looming large on the very near horizon, it stands to reason that we'll likely see more from Heard, whether it's in the context of her own case or not. </p>

<p>Following a three-week trial in July last year, Mr. Justice Nicol ruled that Mr Depp, 57, assaulted Ms. Heard, 34, on a dozen occasions and put her in “fear for her life” at least three times.</p>
<p>Depp is challenging that ruling.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, Johnny Depp’s legal team is asking to submit new evidence that was previously unheard during the trial but has direct bearing upon Depp’s appeal request.</p>
<p>There’s some speculation among netizens as to what that evidence could be. Some hope for those salacious Toronto tapes, but more think that the new evidence has to do with proving that Heard lied about donating $7 million dollars to charity as a condition of their divorce. It was those charitable donations that caused Justice Nicol to decide that Heard was not a “gold digger.” If it can be proven that she didn’t donate the money, Nicol’s finding in that regard can definitely be challenged, and could affect whether or not Depp can continue with his appeal process.</p>
<p>There will be a two-hour hearing sometime between March 15th and 30th regarding that matter.</p>

The two got together when Wood was in her teens and MM was in his thirties.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who immediately believe Wood because of her history of talking about this alleged abuse, and because Manson is just so weird. Also because he wrote in his autobiography that he used to be an abusive piece of shit and that he used to imagine crushing her skull with a sledgehammer. And for saying that the song “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies” was inspired by one of their breakups.</p>
<p>On top of that, four other women have stepped forward with similar accusations of their own against MM.</p>
<p>All of that, along with Wood’s disturbing allegations have a lot of people willing to crucify MM on the nearest telephone pole.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with Amber Heard or Aquaman 2? At first glance, nothing. But if we take a closer look, the associations abound.</p>
<p>First, ERW is “close” friends with Heard. Wood has come out in <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/Evan-Rachel-Wood-defends-Amber-Heard-amid-her-feud-with-Johnny-Depp/articleshow/53280392.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">support of Heard</a>’s allegations against Johnny Depp since Heard first started to allege them – which is just about the time that Wood started talking about being a victim of domestic abuse. Coincidence number one.</p>
<p>Also, it’s a pretty well-known fact that MM is (or was) best of buddies with Johnny Depp. The two of them haven’t been seen together in about a year, but they have a long history of being besties. Whether or not that’s still the case isn’t really known.</p>
<p>It’s also a fact that as far as I know, none of the women accusing MM ever called the police or filed any reports. The only word we have is in the media and on social media. I’m not saying that makes them liars, far from it. A lot of victims never report their abuse. Johnny Depp didn’t call the police. He relied upon his own private security to protect him.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is that the allegations against MM are pretty severe, with women saying they’ve been violently raped, had their lives threatened, were locked in closets, were beaten, even whipped, and more. With allegations so severe, it’s easy to wonder why the police weren’t called, at least by one of them. It would certainly make the allegations easier to swallow.</p>
<p>I’m also not saying MM didn’t do it. His own words in his autobiography don’t bode well for him, certainly.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that we need to wait and see some proof, one way or the other. Until that happens, all we have is a she-say/he-say situation.</p>
<p>It could come down in a number of ways. MM could be the heartless, sadistic monster his self-proclaimed victims say he is, and he should be locked up for life.</p>
<p>Or it could come down that the girls are in cahoots. Wood and Heard, I mean. The two of them, friends, have been alleging abuse against MM and Johnny Depp for roughly the same amount of time, and now would be a great time to come forward with MM’s name, what with the legalities between Heard and Johnny Depp shaping up the way they are. It’s not looking too good for Heard in the Fairfax, VA defamation case Johnny has leveled against her. So what better time to cut the legs out from under Johnny’s bff with allegations of even more monstrous abuse?</p>
<p>Or the two cases could have nothing whatsoever to do with each other but coincidence.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s too soon to call.</p>
<p>One thing that is a fact is that Amber Heard has made it more difficult for victims of either gender to come forward with their stories of abuse thanks to her lies about being abused. Her sh*tstorm of mainstream media stories and crusade through the #MeToo movement have made it nigh impossible for anybody to come forward without enduring intense scrutiny. Gone are the days when we could #BelieveAllWomen. Heard’s completely ruined that.</p>
<p>So yeah. While there is a faction ready to believe her outright, ERW is being looked at with some skepticism by a large contingency.</p>
<p>The only real truth here is that time will have to tell the truth of what’s going on. My suggestion is to neither believe nor deny these allegations against MM until there’s some shred of proof to back them up, or to prove that they’re false.</p>
<p>That’s what happened with Johnny Depp. He was accused of domestic abuse and a lot of people believed it. Then proof came out that those allegations were false.</p>
<p>That’s what I’m saying we should do here. Wait for some proof. Reserve judgement until we know definitively, one way or the other. The truth always outs, and it will in this case, too.</p>
<p>What do you think? Hang the dude’s reputation on her word? Or wait and see?</p>","{'id': '225158142', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/rl/ds/fMrlDSKhJQkHUzj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612224157', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against

<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>Jason Momoa's total net worth is reported to be $14 million, and that's combined with his wife, former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet's net worth. It's not impossible that Momoa was paid a figure in the millions, but it's not likely. </p>
<p>Let's take a look at some examples for comparison.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr, a talented and well-respected actor was reportedly paid $500 thousand for Iron Man. </p>
<p>Gal Gadot was reportedly paid $300 thousand for Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>These two were the stars of their movies. And we're supposed to believe that Amber Heard was paid $7 million for a supporting role? It's not impossible, I suppose. But I suspect that pigs would sooner fly.</p>
<p>The same magazine clip claims that Heard will probably make closer to $10 million for her part in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at that, too.</p>
<p>Sources have confirmed that Amber Heard will not be in Aquaman 2. She hasn't been fired, exactly. Word has it that she was never re-hired. Being bondable is one concern. Morals clause infringements might very well be another.</p>
<p>Rather, her contract has reportedly been bought out by WB. So, while she might have been paid for the project, she will likely not appear in it.</p>
<p>Like other stories about Amber Heard, I suspect that this one is greatly exaggerated. </p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard dipped in gold and worth millions? Or is she on her way out the door from Hollywood?</p>","{'id': '225152561', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/3/bq/tt/uLbQtToFGCFlEYl-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612123406', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
72,StarterPetitionUpdate,28451726,2021-01-29T20:31:22.000Z,,Fairfax and Oz,"<p>It's entirely possible that Johnny Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard might get pushed back into the timing of when Heard claims she's supposed to be filming Aquaman 2. </p>
<p>Remember when Johnny Depp wanted to make arrangements for the trial to allow for his filming of FB? Heard successfully argued against it, refusing to let the court make any such allowances for him. That might, in part, have been why Johnny Depp was asked to step down from the franchise. His filming schedule would have been interrupted - partly by that three-day deposition she made him sit for that conflicted with filming.</p>
<p>Well, now the shoe is on the other foot.</p>
<p>Because of court's Covid-related scheduling conflicts, the case may very well be pushed back into what she claims will be HER filming schedule. And, since she already argued against scheduling court around filming for him, the same applies to her. </p>
<p>If .court couldn't be rescheduled for him, it can't be rescheduled for her.</p>
<p>Sauce for the gander is just as good for the goose.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of fact that filming for Aquaman 2 will take place in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to smuggling her dogs into Australia. </p>
<p>Given both of these circumstances, and the fact that reliable sources report that her contract has been bought out, chances are very slim (see what I did there?) that Heard will appear in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard be AM2? Or is she all washed up?</p>

<p>Right. There's no real answer to that. Because if hair on somebody's head is being violently yanked, whole clumps of it don't just break off, no matter how damaged it is.</p>
<p>No. There's no evidence to show that this clump of hair ""broke"" off during a violent tussle. And that begs the question: Where did it come from? Is it possible that this photo is staged to try to frame Depp?</p>

<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we? </p>
<p>Amber Heard recorded conversations with herself and ex Johnny Depp, in which she calls him a baby for ducking out of fights. She criticizes him harshly for leaving every single fight, admonishing him for not staying and fighting.</p>
<p>She also admits to being the one that starts physical fights. Johnny answers that when things get physical, they have to separate, and she berates him again, daring him to tell the world that he's a victim because nobody will believe him.</p>

<p>Now, you tell me. Does it sound like the action of a violent man to leave whenever fights get physical, started by Heard, by her own admission?</p>
<p>Of course not. But there are people out there that want to believe Heard because she's a woman, or who haven't bothered to educate themselves to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>That's why Johnny's case is so important. Not just to clear his own name, but to clear a path for abused men to be able to come forward as victims and be believed.</p>

<p>There's a subpoena issued for ""an executive"" from Disney, seeking: “all information relating to documents and communications of any nature” on Depp and “incidents of drug or alcohol use (including suspected drug or alcohol use).” Similarly, they are looking for any information about “any delays or tardiness caused by Mr. Depp,” “any incidents of violence or abuse by Mr. Depp,” any info on impute the actor had or “hiring, casting,” and “disagreements with the writers, directors or producers with the filming, editing and/or release of Pirates 5.”</p>

<p>Heard has said in numerous interviews in the last several years that the money was donated, split between those two charities. She also testified to it under oath, under penalty of Perjury.</p>
<p>Well, lately, things have gotten really interesting. Turns out the only contribution that’s been made to the Children’s hospital was the original $100,000 Johnny Depp made on her behalf. And there’s no proof of what, if anything, Amber Heard donated to the ACLU herself. Apparently there have been donations made on her behalf, but no proof that she, herself, donated a single red cent.</p>
<p>For one thing, it was part of a legally binding contract (her divorce), that she would donate that money. For another thing, she testified under penalty of perjury that she donated it.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the penalty for Perjury in the UK is up to 7 years in prison. Pile that on top of perjury charges she’s being investigated for in Australia, and those years are really starting to pile up on her.</p>
<p>In a truly amusing turn of events, Amber Heard, through her lawyer, is now claiming that she can’t make those donations because of Johnny’s ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>""However, Amber has been delayed in that goal because Mr. Depp filed a lawsuit against her, and consequently, she has been forced to spend millions of dollars defending Mr. Depp's false accusations against her.""</p>
<p>And never mind that Heard was supposed to have made those donations 3 years before he ever filed suit against her.</p>
<p>Heard plans to fulfill those donations “eventually,” her lawyer says.</p>
<p>So, basically, Heard’s defense against being accused of not paying 7 million dollars to charity is to admit that she didn’t pay 7 million dollars to charity, and blame it on Johnny.</p>

But the parts where she mentions this petition say that:</p>
<p>“The allegations that “Mr. Depp has initiated, coordinated, overseen and/or supported and amplified two change.org petitions: one to remove Ms. Heard as an actress in the Aquaman movie franchise, and one to remove her as a  spokeswoman for L’Oreal” fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See Countercl. Paragraph 6. Nothing in that allegation implies facts showing that the change.org petitions included obscene language, threatened illegal or immoral acts, or suggest or propose obscene acts. See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Likewise, the allegation that Mr. Depp “created, coordinated, controlled, and/or manipulated social media accounts created specifically for the purpose of targeting Ms. Heard,” also fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See VA code 18.2-152.7:1. The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Because neither of those allegations meet the second element of the VCCA, they cannot move forward in this litigation.”</p>
<p>So the court didn’t buy all that nonsense about Johnny Depp  being responsible for these petition and all us “Russian bots.” So even the court recognizes how ridiculous that claim was.</p>

<p>Me, I think it’s the calm before the storm. We still haven’t seen the majority of the footage from the Eastern Columbia building’s surveillance system, and we’re waiting with bated breath for the Toronto tapes. When those hit the public purview, nothing’s going to be the same.</p>
<p>Why didn’t we see this evidence in the Sun trial? Because the Sun had nothing to do with the Eastern Columbia building. The Sun had nothing to do with Toronto.</p>
<p>Too many people lost sight of the fact that the Sun trial wasn’t between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. It was against Johnny Depp and The Sun. Amber Heard was only a witness.</p>
<p>The Fairfax, VA trial is between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. As such, ALL the evidence comes into play. And I sincerely doubt that we’ve even scratched the surface with all the evidence we’ve seen so far. If I were on Johnny Depp’s legal team, I’d save the best for last, pulling out the aces when the time’s right. When it’s so damning that Amber Heard will have absolutely no defense. When it will well and truly screw her, finally revealing her for who and what she is, what she did, and holding her accountable for it.</p>
<p>We want to see the worst of it so that we can commiserate with Johnny and support him. But we also want him to prevail. We want him to win so that he can clear his good name, once and for all.</p>
<p>Wait for it, folks. Things might be quiet now, but I’m betting that the very best is yet to come.</p>","{'id': '225027246', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/cj/hy/cqCJhyftbHttrMb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609436145', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against

<p>“This year has been so hard for so many. Here’s to a better time ahead. Happy Holidays, everyone! My love and respect to you all. Eternally, JD. X” He posted it with a picture of himself looking happy and well with Shane MacGowan on the set of the documentary Crock of Gold, which Depp produced.</p>
<p>That post has received over  1,965,562 likes.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the same token, Amber Heard was interviewed by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uretrfMA-Io"" rel=""nofollow"">Access Hollywood</a> in a new video on YouTube talking about how she’s adapted and survived 2,000, including her legal troubles with Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>That video has received over 283,000 DISlikes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the comments on that video are heavily laden with sentiments supporting Johnny Depp, identifying with him as the victim of Amber Heard’s abuse. “They won’t believe you, because you are a man” many commenters post, due to an audio in which Amber Heard taunted Johnny saying that people wouldn’t believe that he was in fact an abuse victim. They call Amber out for portraying herself as the victim when the opposite is in fact true, by her own admission. “I was hitting you,” She confessed to Johnny on tape. And the public won’t let her forget it.</p>
<p>Considering the number of likes Johnny Gets compared to the number of dislikes and negative comments Heard gets, I think it’s pretty clear how the public feels about the two of them. </p>","{'id': '225018363', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/5/wo/hd/UnwOHdPdbybJVaq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609185161', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
85,StarterPetitionUpdate,28266946,2020-12-24T19:56:57.000Z,,Johnny Depp requests retrial,"<p>Johnny Depp has asked the Court of Appeal to order a retrial of his libel claim against The Sun over an article calling him a “wife beater”, which a High Court judge found was “substantially true”. Justice Nicol, the judge in the case, basically believed Amber Heard’s claims that she was abused, and found that the Sun, therefore, had every right to call Depp a “wife beater” on their front page.</p>
<p>Since this ruling, many tabloids, which I will not link to here, have run rampant, calling Depp a wife-beater and just about everything else in the book.</p>
<p>Johnny’s request for a retrial claims that he “did not receive a fair trial” and the judge’s ruling is “plainly wrong” and “manifestly unsafe”, according to documents filed by Mr. Depp’s legal team with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>Says David Sherborne, counsel for Johnny Depp: “The judge failed to properly assess [Heard’s] credibility by reference to documentary evidence, photographs, recordings or otherwise.” He further claimed that audio recordings of Mr Depp and Ms Heard while they were in a relationship demonstrated that “Ms Heard had not only been the violent one … but that she had also been untruthful in her oral evidence about the appellant’s violence”.</p>
<p>You can view the documents Johnny’s legal team filed on <a href=""https://www.nickwallis.com/courtofappeal"" rel=""nofollow"">Nickwallis.com</a>.</p>
<p>NGN will have to file a response and then a decision will be taken by a Court of Appeal judge on whether or not to allow the application (this can be done with or without a hearing). A decision could come down as early as January. If Depp’s request for a retrial is dismissed, it’s all over and Nicol’s judgment stands.</p>
<p>At that point, Johnny’s only recourse against his ex-wife (Heard) will be his upcoming defamation suit against her resulting from her op-ed in the Washington Post, in which she describes herself as a survivor of his domestic abuse. She doesn’t name him specifically in that piece, but she’s been naming him ever since their split in every other outlet, so her message was clear and obvious.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping the new year brings Johnny the vindication he deserves.</p>

86,StarterPetitionUpdate,28262754,2020-12-23T16:14:24.000Z,,Amber Heard AM2 role shrinking,"<p>Up until now, most of the fallout from Johnny Depp’s legal woes with ex-wife Amber Heard has been at Johnny Depp’s expense. Now, a lot of folks on the internet are campaigning to see Heard suffer the same treatment. In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 is nearing a staggering 2 million signatures. And while WB has yet to announce any plans to hire another actress for the role, it seems that they’re trying to come up with a compromise.</p>
<p>With all of this going on, it looks like WB is gearing up to either reduce Amber Heard’s role in Aquaman 2 or write her out altogether.</p>
<p>According to Grace Randolph, the host of the “Beyond The Trailer” YouTube channel, the studio is bringing on another female lead to ‘balance things out.’</p>
<p>“Some of you are asking re Amber Heard – as I told you before, they are bringing on this new female lead to balance things out, and writing the script so that Heard’s role can be cut down if needed. But as of right now she’s still in Aquaman 2,” the journalist wrote on her Twitter feed. </p>
<p>As we learned last month, Warner Bros. may not be able to fire the London Fields star if it comes to it due to her contract. What they can do, however, is find a way to sideline her character in favor of a newcomer in Aquaman 2. To what extent they’ll do so, though, is anyone’s guess at this point.</p>
<p>Another source has maintained that al of this speculation is pointless, as Amber Heard has already been removed from Aquaman 2. If those sources are to be believed, it’s true that Amber Heard can’t be officially fired, but that she’s been bought out of her contract. Pretty much the same situation as Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts. They fired Johnny, but paid his contract. That’s what it’s rumored happened to heard. They basically paid her not to be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is due to start shooting in Australia after the new year ahead of its scheduled release in December 2022. Time will tell if Heard will be involved. It’s entirely possible that the new female lead isn’t just being brought on board to “balance things out.” She might be Heard’s replacement.</p>
<p>Good.</p>

87,StarterPetitionUpdate,28247422,2020-12-19T17:12:14.000Z,,The latest,"<p>Two years to the day after Amber Heard published an editorial describing the backlash she faced as a domestic abuse survivor, a Virginia judge ordered the actress to produce her arrest record in the defamation case filed against her by ex-husband Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Her arrest record, which involves an altercation with a different romantic partner more than a decade ago, is “crucial to key allegations in Mr. Depp’s complaint,” said the actor’s lawyer, Benjamin Chew of Brown Rudnick, during a hearing Friday in Fairfax County. </p>
<p>Thing is, though, that I’m pretty sure there have been more arrests than Heard’s 2009 arrest for domestic violence against her wife Tasya Van Ree. As I understand it, there have been a couple of DUI’s and rumor has it that there was at least one other arrest for domestic violence. I don’t know against whom, but it looks like we’re going to find out.</p>
<p>If this is true and Amber Has multiple arrests against her for domestic violence, it could be crucial in helping Johnny Depp establish that it was Heard who was violent in their relationship.</p>
<p>On the same day, a subpoena was issued to the ACLU, one of the organizations to which Heard swears she donated part of her 7 million dollar divorce settlement. It  has long been rumored that Heard didn’t donate to these organizations as she swore in her divorce documents, legal court documents, that she would.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what could happen to Heard if she kept the money and didn’t donate it, or didn’t donate all of it, like she said she would. Contempt of court, maybe? Or would this even be grounds for the divorce to be revisited? Could she owe that money back to Johnny? We’ll have to wait and see what the fallout is, but the fact is that she will now have to prove in a court of law what she did with that money.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it goes to her credibility if she swore to donate that money and didn’t. Not that her credibility holds much weight anymore.</p>
<p>Three days later, the court issued a subpoena for iO Tillet Wright, longtime friend and flying monkey of Heard’s. <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/high-profile/depp%20v%20heard/cl-2019-2911-foreign-subp-prep-io-tillet-wright-12-18-2020.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The service notice</a> doesn’t say whether it was Heard’s side or Johnny’s that requested the subpoena. It would be interesting to see who called iO. It’ll be even more interesting to see how far iO is willing to go to perjure himself for Heard. It’s one thing to lie to a court abroad where they can’t touch you. It’s another thing to perjure oneself in America where they can easily find you and level perjury charges. It’ll be interesting to see how far any of her friends are willing to perjure themselves.</p>
<p>It bears note that some of those previously pro-Heard folks are deleting their social media en masse. I don’t know if it’s related to the defamation case that’s looming ever larger, but it’s certainly possible.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it looks like Amber Heard’s legal world is crashing down on her. I wonder what her response will be when Johnny wins his defamation case, and then wins his appeal in the libel case he leveled against the Sun tabloid and subsequently lost. I wonder what the whole world’s reaction will be. So many have been so quick to vilify him. I wonder how quick they’ll be to vindicate him.</p>
<p>Time alone will tell.</p>

<p>The agency has even made a statement regarding Amber’s entry into the agency. On their official website, Amber Heard is described her as “An outspoken advocate for women’s rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence around the world, Amber works with organizations that encourage survivors both personally and politically to come forward and reclaim their power. Amber makes frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence.”<br><br>If you’d like to hire her to speak at your event, she can be booked for the princely sum of $33,000. The agency describes her talks as “deeply moving” and says that hiring her is an excellent choice for a group or organization that’s looking for “some much-needed inspiration from a woman who walks day-to-day looking to be a contribution.”</p>
<p>There are, of course, those who would vehemently disagree. A large contingency of the public view Heard as a woman who abused her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as she admitted as much on audiotape. Those people find it ludicrous that Heard should dare to claim to be a spokesperson for survivors when she herself is an admitted abuser with a history of being arrested for domestic abuse against wife Tasya Van Ree in 2009.</p>
<p>Heard has already spoken at the Global Citizen Festival, the Social Good Summit and the L’Oreal Women of Worth awards, leading the reader to believe that Heard was paid to speak at those events. So, with a payday of up to $33,000 per appearance, her outpouring of heartfelt civic duty doesn’t exactly come across as altogether altruistic, does it? Rather, she seems motivated by the payday, which some would argue has always been her only impetus.</p>
<p>I for one will be interested to see how many people or organizations will hire Heard to speak for such a hefty payday. As more and more evidence comes out about the sort of person she really is, I can only imagine that this prospect will fail for her, just like all the rest of them do.</p>

<p>Instead, I suggest showing our support for Johnny Depp by watching something by Johnny Depp instead, whether it’s a DVD you already own, or picking a Johnny Depp movie on the streaming platform of your choice. There are lots of excellent movies to choose from, so it shouldn't be too hard finding a good one. Me, I'll probably be watching Pirates.</p>
<p>I like Stephen King’s work as much as the next guy, and I know that he didn’t personally hire Amber Heard, but I simply cannot support a project that she’s in. Nothing personal Steve. I just can't.</p>
<p>So if you feel the same way, let’s let the industry know that we’re having none of her by boycotting ‘The Stand’ and stream something by Johnny Depp instead. Let 'em know what we want: Johnny Depp. And what we don't want: Amber Heard. </p>

90,StarterPetitionUpdate,28195245,2020-12-09T23:53:53.000Z,,Johnny dropped the N bomb to Ex Lori Anne Allison?,"<p>“Sources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny.”</p>
<p>That’s just one of the many allegations put forth in an article published by The Hollywood Reporter. There are a ton of others, but I won’t dignify them by repeating them here. I’ll post the link because I have to cite my sources, but I’m hoping that you won’t give them any hits by clicking through to read it. It’s just all the same lies Amber Heard’s been spouting over the last few years.</p>
<p>I selected this statement to write about because this is the first time I’ve ever seen it. And because it’s so full of outrageous and flawed elements that I just had to pick it apart.</p>
<p>First, “Sources”? Really? Until or unless these “sources” are identified, it’s pretty hard to take anything that follows seriously.</p>
<p>Second, it doesn’t say WHEN this alleged payment took place. Johnny married Lori Anne more than 30 years ago. That’s a long stretch of road during which this alleged transaction could have taken place. They’re going to have to narrow it down a little more before it can be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Third, they also don’t say WHEN this long, ranting message took place. Was it back when they were together? Sometime since? Did he recently call Lori Anne out of the blue just to leave audio evidence of racial epithets nobody else on the planet has ever accused him of using? Just like I said a minute ago, they need to narrow down the timeline.</p>
<p>Fourth, when else has Johnny ever been accused of using language like that? Every? So we’re supposed to believe that he did it on tape just because some unnamed “sources” say so? Are we really supposed to be that gullible?</p>
<p>Fifth, where’s this message? If “sources” have heard it, why haven’t we? Are we supposed to believe that a tape like this exists and it hasn’t been leaked to the public?</p>
<p>Sixth, why in the world would Johnny Depp need to use a fake name to give his ex-wife some money? If Johnny wanted to give his ex some money, for whatever reason, there’s no reason whatsoever that he couldn’t just do so. He gave Vanessa money, too, and there’s nothing shady about it. By all accounts, he’s a generous guy. Why shouldn’t he be able to give his ex some money if he wants to?</p>
<p>I’m sorry, folks, but it doesn’t quite wash. They talk about scrutiny, but the fact is that there are far too few details for a claim like this to stand up to even the most casual scrutiny.</p>
<p>The point here, is that headlines like this are juicy and look damning on the surface, but you need to look a little deeper to determine if there’s any substance to back them up. This is just one among many allegations being tossed about in the press since the court in the UK ruled against him in his libel case against the Sun. The media’s been having a field day at Johnny’s expense, and there’s no more substance to those headlines than there are to this one. It’s just a bunch of fluffed-up rubbish set forth with no more justification than that someone said so.</p>
<p>Don’t take the headlines seriously, boys and girls, no matter how good – or bad – they look. There’s a good chance that it’s just a bunch of unfounded allegations being printed to sell papers. Or to get clicks online. That’s all. They, the papers, don’t care about the truth. If they did, they’d be exposing Johnny Depp’s abuser, proven by her own words, rather than serving the victim up on a platter the way they are. So don’t give them the satisfaction of giving their trash a second glance. Stick to the world of facts which have been proven, tried and true, by the abuser herself.</p>
<p>The truth will out in the end. It’s no coincidence that this article came out at the same time as Johnny applied to the higher court to move forward with his appeal to overturn the verdict in the Sun case. Like I said before, it’s all an agenda that’s being spoon fed to you. Don’t swallow it.</p>
<p>Keep your wits about you, folks, and keep fighting the good fight. We'll end up on the right side of the roaring rapids in the end.</p>

He posted a picture of himself and Amber Heard with the caption “Me trying not to get beat up every day on set for 3 months.”</p>
<p>Well, on December 2nd, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">that video</a> went up on YouTube. Steven and his buddy Jason were chatting away, and then, about 12 minutes in, Steven starts talking about Amber Heard. He described first meeting her as sex personified, and so charming and overpowering that if she’d told him to go out and kill somebody, he would have done it. Not really, of course, but he was illustrating how much influence she can have on people, even at first sight. At least back then.</p>
<p>He went on to talk about Amber and the fights that she used to get into with her wife Tasya Van Ree, saying that they were real blow up fights. He also hinted at Amber’s drug and alcohol consumption as activities that he saw with his own two eyes.</p>
<p>Steven also talked about how Amber Heard was when she worked with Johnny Depp on the Rum Diary. Heard wasn’t even remotely interested in Depp. She was married to Tasya, but was well aware of Johnny’s interest in her, he said. It wasn’t until after another couple of movies failed, a tv show failed, then all of a sudden you hear about Amber Heard being with Johnny Depp, and wouldn’t you know it, she started getting parts.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was with Johnny Depp to further her career. That’s what Steven said without saying it.</p>
<p>Steven beat around the bush about a LOT of stories he said he could tell, but he was scared to death of getting sued if he told them. Jason assured Steven that the truth is the ultimate defense against a law suit, and that maybe these stories need to be told so that the world has both sides of the situation, not just the one that Heard is telling the world. Still, Steven hesitated and ultimately refused to say any more. The two agreed to talk about this more off-screen and then come back and revisit the issue in a future video.</p>
<p>What strikes me the most about the whole thing is how scared Steven was to talk about events he saw with his own two eyes. And, he said, there are a lot more people with stories to tell that are afraid to talk, too.</p>
<p>Why? Why are these people afraid of her? Because she’ll sue them? Like Jason said, the truth is the best defense against that. And it’s not just a matter of he say/She say if multiple people are stepping forward to corroborate each other’s stories. And I’m sure there are some people with photos or videos to back their stories up. They just have to work up the nerve to step forward and speak up.</p>
<p>All it takes is for one person to say “enough” and stand up. Once that first brave soul makes a stand and speaks out against Amber Heard, I think the floodgates will open up and everybody else who’s been holding back stories will come forward too. And it’ll be high time. This no-talent would-be actress has held her reign of terror long enough.</p>
<p>And I think that with the VA trial coming up, her web is going to start falling apart. She’s having to subpoena people who were previously willing to talk about her freely. I think they’re starting to realize what they’ve got to lose, and that her ship is sinking. And it is. The USS Amber Heard is taking on water, more every day. It’s only a matter of time until those rats start hopping off. I think we’re seeing it already.</p>
<p>By all means, go have a look at Steven Crowley’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a>. See for yourself all of the stories he hints at being able to tell about her, and witness how afraid he is to talk.</p>

But a common theme is saying that the claims on the petition are unsubstantiated. So let’s take a look at one piece of evidence. Or have a listen. <a href=""https://www.courttv.com/news/amber-heard-witness-statements-depp-blamed-the-monster-for-physical-verbal-abuse/"" rel=""nofollow"">These</a> are the <a href=""https://www.courttv.com/news/amber-heard-witness-statements-depp-blamed-the-monster-for-physical-verbal-abuse/"" rel=""nofollow"">audio recordings</a> that were admitted into court, and were officially accepted into evidence.</p>
<p>Amber Heard admits in her own recordings that she repeatedly instigated physical fights with Johnny Depp and became enraged when he would often “split” to avoid the confrontation. She accused him of being a monster because he refused to stay and fight.</p>
<p>“The monster is back, this is him. Ran away at the first sign of trouble.” So the monster is not someone who hits her. The monster is someone who runs away at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>Hardly what Heard wanted the world to think, given her testimony. But it goes to show that not only is Johnny not the monster Heard apparently wanted everyone to believe, but also that the claims on this petition are also based in reality.  </p>

<p>Depp has been the face of the aftershave since it launched in 2015 with an advertising campaign that was criticized for its racist portrayal of Native Americans. But many were surprised to see an advert for the fragrance, featuring Depp playing a guitar, being shown on TV during The Great British Bake Off this week.</p>
<p>“We have received a total of 11 complaints about this ad,” a spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Authority said, “with the complainants believing that Johnny Depp shouldn’t be in the ad due to details concerning his recent court case.”</p>
<p>Depp was rumored to have been paid between $3m and $5m for the Sauvage advert.</p>
<p>Since the advert was broadcast, fans of Depp, using the hashtag #Justiceforjohnnydepp, have been posting messages of support on social media for the actor and Dior’s continued association with him. “Johnny Depp is still the face of Sauvage, because Dior aren’t idiots,” said one post. “Shout out to Dior for practically being the one sponsor left for Johnny Depp that hasn’t turned their back on him,” said another. “He’s still the face of their cologne Sauvage, definitely gonna get me a bottle to show my support.”</p>
<p>Asked if there was a chance Dior could use Depp again, Lauren Sherman, the chief correspondent for the Business of Fashion, said: “In the past, pre-social media, I would have bet on it. Now there is more to lose. It’s possible, but it’s riskier.”</p>
<p>Despite the shadow of “cancel culture”, Sherman said she thought Dior was taking the position of “all publicity is good publicity”.</p>
<p>“Most businesses like that take a long view, which is that growing awareness is good overall,” she said. “People will forget about the Depp association with time, but they may not forget the Sauvage name so easily.”</p>
<p>Dior has yet to comment, but ads continue to grace the airwaves. So I think we have our answer.</p>
<p>I, personally, am here to tell you that an overwhelming number of people have posted about their Sauvage purchases. Others have tried to purchase the brand, but have found it to be sold out. I think it’s safe to say that Dior made the right choice to keep Johnny Depp.</p>

94,StarterPetitionUpdate,28130001,2020-11-27T03:52:17.000Z,,Amber Heard in Pirates?,"<p>It’s not bad enough that Johnny Depp has lost the lead in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, has been asked to step down from Fantastic Beasts, lost his libel case against NGN and The Sun tabloid, and was denied his appeal. Now there are rumors that his ex-wife, Amber Heard, is in talks with Margot Robbie to appear in a remake of Pirates heavily laden with what Robbie calls “Girl Power.”</p>
<p>With this rumor about Pirates, what Heard insists will be her return to Aquaman 2 despite this petition that has more than 1.5 million signatures, and possibly a spinoff featuring Mera, her Aquaman role, it might look like Heard is riding high on a wave of professional success.</p>
<p>But let’s take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>First, there’s absolutely no substance to the rumor that Heard is getting anywhere near Pirates. Daniel Richtman said so on his Patreon account, and internet news sources have picked it up and run with it, but there’s no proof whatsoever. I could say that I’M going to be in Pirates, but that doesn’t make it true. Unfortunately, though, we live in a society where any tabloid rumor is considered news. But not everything you read is true, so don't take it on gospel just because it's on the internet.</p>
<p>Next, Aquaman 2. While Heard insists that she’ll be returning as Mera, there are a couple factors that make me doubt it. For one thing, the word through the grapevine is that WB bought out her contract. If that’s true, they paid her NOT to be in the movie. For another thing, the movie will shoot in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to when she smuggled her dogs into the country in violation of Australia’s bio-laws. She could get arrested if she shows up there. And the main cast usually knows exactly when production is going to start, and all she can say is “Next year.” Nah, I sincerely doubt that Heard’s going to appear in AM2.</p>
<p>A Mera spinoff? There’s even less of a reason to believe that this is happening, and that’s saying something. There might have been a time when this idea was bantered about, which is understandable considering the popularity of the original film, and WB might be looking to ramp up their own girl power front. But now, with Heard’s troubles, I sincerely doubt that a spinoff is going to happen. You can see all of the reasons I gave above regarding her return to Aquaman. And you can add the whispers that Heard is unbondable, which would mean that she can’t be insured for filming. No insurance, no filming. Not for Pirates, AM2, and definitely not for her own film franchise.</p>
<p>No, folks. These rumors of all these great projects are just that. Rumors. Spoon fed to the media by someone with an agenda. It sounds like Heard is trying to not only obliterate her ex, Johnny Depp, in courts and in the press. It looks like she’s trying to replace him. What’s next? Heard being prominently featured in a Harry Potter film? It wouldn’t surprise me if that rumor started floating around, too.</p>
<p>Be careful what you believe in the press, folks. Until those rumors can be corroborated, take ‘em with a pinch of salt. The proof is in the pudding, and I’ve got a feeling that Heard is going to leave us all starving.</p>","{'id': '224909480', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/0/cy/xp/ndCYXprYUnoLzox-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606449372', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
95,StarterPetitionUpdate,28123888,2020-11-25T21:23:15.000Z,,"Appeal denied, but there's still hope","<p>Johnny Depp was recently dealt a blow when he lost his libel case against NgN and The Sun tabloid. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 57, has also been ordered to pay £628,000 in legal costs to The Sun for his failed libel action against the newspaper.</p>
<p>But determined to see justice done, Johnny Depp wrote a note on his <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CHQXHimJvAC/"" rel=""nofollow"">Instagram</a> saying that he intended to appeal. </p>
<p>The first step in the appeal process is to get permission to move forward with the appeal. As promised, Johnny did indeed file for an appeal. But I'm sorry to say that permission to move forward with the appeal was denied. By the same judge that found against him in the first place, (in)Justice Nicol.</p>
<p>Got that? The SAME JUDGE that found against Johnny in the first place turned down his bid for an appeal, saying that he did not believe that Johnny's appeal had a ""reasonable prospect of success. In any event, I do not consider that the proposed grounds of appeal have a reasonable prospect of success (and that is also the case so far as the grounds of appeal suggest that I erred in principle or in law) and there is not some other compelling reason why permission to appeal should be granted.""</p>
<p>In his ruling Mr. (in)Justice Nicol wrote: ""The findings of fact by a first instance tribunal (particularly one, such as myself, who has heard oral evidence) are rarely open to challenge on appeal.""</p>
<p>But that's not the end of Johnny's appeal. Apparently, going through (in)justice Nicol for the first part of the appeal was just a step that had to be taken as a matter of routine. Now, Johnny can take the case directly to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>That's the good news. Most likely, Johnny's appeal has every chance of being victorious, meaning that the original court finding will be overturned.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the appeal process could take as long as 2 years. Anything can happen in that time, and that's a long time for an actor to wait between roles, if the verdict is held against him in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Rumor has it though, that Robert Downey Jr is talking about including Johnny in an upcoming project. And Johnny is reportedly in talks about upcoming projects with Netflix. So Johnny's acting future might not be as dismal as it might seem with him booted from both Pirates and Fantastic Beasts 3. It looks like he'll rise above this nonsense.</p>
<p>Still, up to 2 years is a long time to wait.</p>

I don’t know why they have to be RUSSIAN bots. Why can't they be Mexican bots. Or Japanese bots. There are a lot of countries in the world. She can take her pick.</p>
<p>She’s also tried dismissing this petition as having no basis in reality. Yet she keeps bringing it up in court documents, both in the UK and VA cases. Which is it, I wonder? Seems like the poor thing can’t make up her mind.</p>
<p>One thing’s pretty clear, though. This petition bugs the everlovin’ sh*t right out of her.</p>
<p>Our little petition is under attack. Somebody (wonder who?) started spamming my comments with nasty comments last week, then reporting them as violations, trying to get the petition taken down for violating Change .org’s terms of service. And it might have come pretty close to working. For a few days, features of the petition were removed and altered. Some people couldn’t find the petition at all, and others weren’t able to sign it if they could.</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t work.</p>
<p>I got in touch with Change .org and took control of the petition back. I asked them to hide my comments for a while so that they can’t be spammed and then reported as violations. I don’t like that the comments are off, I like for people to be able to speak their minds. It bugs me that freedom of expression is being curtailed. 99% of the comments were from decent people who felt the need to speak out against injustice, abuse, and bad acting.</p>
<p>But people haven’t been put off by these recent actions, and the petition is still standing strong. No matter how hard somebody’s trying to make it, people are still finding the petition in droves.</p>
<p>By signing the petition, millions of people are speaking in one voice, saying that they do not want to see Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. And if she doesn’t like that, it’s kind of too bad. she can only blame herself. All I did was turn on a spotlight.</p>
<p>People might not be able to leave comments, for now, but we will not be silenced. The number of signatures keeps climbing, and more living, breathing people are signing all the time.</p>
<p>That speaks louder than words.</p>
<p>Also, this petition isn’t searchable on change .org anymore – not my doing - so it’s more important than ever to sign and share so that people can keep finding it. Thanks a bunch for hanging in there.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it’s worth it to know how very much we’re bugging her.</p>","{'id': '224893509', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/bo/yg/rvboYGMNWdwzjms-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606070533', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
99,StarterPetitionUpdate,28102343,2020-11-21T15:05:10.000Z,,"Amber Heard can't be fired, claims.","<p>According to ScreenRant, WB can’t fire Amber Heard or even ask her to break her contract due to the legal issues involved in her dispute with Depp. In the United States, the plaintiff has to prove malicious intent by the reporter, as well as avoidance of the truth, in order to succeed in a defamation of character suit. However, in the UK system, the journalist in question has to prove to a court that they weren’t acting in bad faith and to justify the accuracy of their reporting.</p>
<p>So The Sun got away with it because all they had to do was say that they believed Amber Heard’s claims in good faith, not that she was telling the truth. And they’ve only gotten away with it until Johnny’s appeal goes through. When that happens, it’s going to be a whole different story.</p>
<p>When Johnny prevails in his upcoming defamation suit against ex-wife Amber Heard, it’ll be much harder for her to secure work, though word through the grapevine has it that she’s already unemployable already because she’s unbondable. So claims of her being case as the invisible girl, or appearing in a movie with Nicolas Cage (a LONG time Johnny Depp friend) are more than likely just that: claims. Unfounded in reality, to coin her phrase.</p>
<p>But then there’s her contract with WB regarding Aquaman 2. Perhaps it is true that she can’t be fired due to these legal proceedings. But that doesn’t mean she can’t be fired for other reasons. For example, most contracts these days have some sort of morals clause.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t mean that her contract can’t be bought out by WB. That’s a whole different circumstance. And reliable rumor has it that’s exactly what happened. So when you hear claims in the press that Heard’s position with WB is unshakable, or that she’s got ALL these roles coming up, take it with a pinch of salt. Just remember those claims that she was going to be in a live-action Hercules movie? Right. She and her PR team can cook up whatever claims they want. Doesn’t make them true.</p>
<p>And remember, when it comes to how things are worded in the press, just remember there’s more than one way to get things done. Take a look at the wording, then take a look around it. Just because she can’t be fired for one reason, it doesn’t mean she can’t be fired for another. And it certainly doesn’t mean that she’s going to be hired for anything new.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would Amber Heard make a good invisible girl?</p>

100,StarterPetitionUpdate,28091945,2020-11-19T18:54:31.000Z,,Heard and Howell,"<p>If you don’t know who Jennifer Howell is, she’s Whitney Heard’s former boss and friend. She was dragged into the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard case when Whitney testified that she fled the situation and slept on Jennifer Howell’s floor. Jennifer spoke up and corrected Whit by saying that she never made Whit sleep on the floor. Since then, it’s come out that Whitney regularly confided in Jennifer about everything that was going on, including Amber being the bully in the staircase episode, and that Amber Heard took Johnny Depp’s finger off. These are crucial points, since Amber Heard painted Johnny Depp as the aggressor in both cases.</p>
<p>Originally, Amber Heard subpoenaed Jennifer Howell, likely expecting her to support her version of events, but was faced with the fact that Jennifer vows to tell the truth. That’s not a good thing for Amber.</p>
<p>So now, Johnny Depp’s team has subpoenaed Jennifer Howell.</p>
<p>Amber Heard’s team jumped all over that, petitioning the court to deny Jennifer Howell’s testimony, calling it irrelevant. But the court has denied that petition, saying that Jennifer Howell can definitely testify. This is the petition that the court called disingenuous, and sanctioned Amber Heard $4,732.50 for wasting the court’s time.</p>
<p>Court said that if Amber Heard thought Jennifer Howell was relevant enough to subpoena in the first place, she can’t turn around and say that Jennifer Howell is irrelevant just because Johnny’s team wants to subpoena her.</p>
<p>On Jennifer Howell’s Instagram, she says:</p>
<p>I was recently subpoenaed into a court case to tell the truth, and I did so. Verdict came down on Monday and the actual truth was destroyed by an unjust system.<br>I share this now because I want to have faith in truth, dignity, love and integrity ultimately winning. My heart has been broken during this process as I have lost faith in so many people who have claimed to be moral and good yet lack the integrity to tell the truth when it might be “an inconvenience” for them.<br>Those same people have contacted old employees of the charity and told them not to speak to attorneys and to dodge subpoenas. Have questioned my integrity for actually telling the truth when I was called to do so and much more. Heartbreaking to lose faith in people. I write this as I am trying not to lose faith in humanity, in justice and in the greater good... Truth and goodness have to win in the end.</p>
<p>The VA case is going to be a jury trial, and I have a feeling that they’re going to give Jennifer’s testimony a great deal of weight, considering she’s friends with the Heards, but is willing to tell the TRUTH regardless of the personal consequences to herself.</p>
<p>I for one can’t wait to see what Jennifer Howell says on the stand. It seems to me that her testimony will be a lynchpin in blowing Amber Heard’s lies wide open, as well as everybody else who lied for her. That puts them ALL in the hot seat for perjury charges not just for the VA case, but also the UK case as well.</p>
<p>Heard keeps digging her own hole deeper and deeper, and she’s dragging people down with her.</p>
<p>I personally think that it’s only a matter of time before those rats start jumping off her sinking ship. I should take bets for who jumps first.</p>
<p>Heard’s little world is crumbling down around her and she’s the only one that doesn’t see it.</p>

And it bears note that the plaintiff issued these subpoenas. Johnny Depp's lawyers, not Amber Heard's.</p>
<p>If you don't remember, Tasya Van Ree was Amber Heard's domestic partner, who Amber was arrested for assaulting in 2009.</p>
<p>We've all seen Rocky and iO lie for Amber, and even Tasya Van Ree once issued a statement downplaying the domestic violence incident. </p>
<p>What we haven't seen is Tasya Van Ree on the stand, under oath, willing to lie for Amber. And, really, she can't. She can try to downplay the incident, but she can't deny that it happened. And if the arresting officer is also called to testify, the severity of the attack will be on full display.</p>
<p>So the question becomes whether or not Van Ree will be willing to outright lie for her former partner, under oath, risking a perjury charge.</p>
<p>Were Rocky and iO called to the stand in the UK? Was Whitney? Was Josh Drew? How many of them will be willing to take the stand in America and commit perjury? The date for the VA trial is getting ever closer. It'll be interesting to see how many of them are willing to keep lying, or how many of those little rats start to jump ship as the date gets closer. Presumably, iO, Rocky and Van Ree have lives and livelihoods they don't want to risk losing by going to jail. And Whitney has a baby son she certainly doesn't want to leave so she can go and serve jail time for her abusive sister.</p>
<p>Truth is, Amber's little make-believe world is closing in around her. Whatever power it is she thinks she's got over people is fragile at best. People have a self-preservation instinct that's stronger than whatever sword of Damocles she's got hanging over their heads. </p>
<p>And, when the first rat cracks, the rest of them will hit the water like Ethel Merman choreographed it. Make no mistake about that.</p>
<p>Now, while Amber might be celebrating what she thinks is a win in the UK, that story isn't finished. Johnny is certain to win his appeal, even if it does take up to two years for the process to run its course. </p>
<p>And let's not forget that Amber's being investigated for perjury in Australia, and they're serious about putting her behind bars. Which begs the question, how is she going to travel to Australia to film Aquaman 2, as she claims, with that looming over her head?</p>
<p>Nah. I've heard that Warner Bros bought out her contract, and that's the information I'm running with. I'd bet dollars to donuts that she won't be AM2. </p>
<p>And I'm waiting to see which rat will jump ship first.</p>
<p>Who do you think it will be? iO? Rocky? Tasya Van Ree? Whitney? Josh Drew? Elon? Somebody else I haven't thought of? Who will turn on Amber first?

Justice Nicol was a lawyer championing for freedom of press for The Times which is owned by Murdock Who employees his son. The Judge's son works with defendant DAN WOOTTON. This combined with other connections between the judge and Amber Heard set Johnny Depp up to fail from the beginning. That’s why Heard was so smug throughout the proceedings. She knew the whole time that she had it in the bag.</p>
<p>But Johnny is appealing the verdict, taking the decision out of Justice Nicol’s hands. Heard might be laughing out the other side of her butt when the appeal comes down in Johnny’s favor.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget the Defamation case coming up in Virginia. Unless that judge has ties to Heard, or has been paid off, that’s a slam dunk for Johnny. There’s a ton of evidence that wasn’t brought forth in the UK trial because it was the Sun in the Hot Seat, not Heard. She was just a witness in that case. In Virginia, she’s the defendant. A LOT of evidence and a myriad of witnesses will be brought that she’ll have a very hard time trying to disprove. Johnny’s got video, audio and witnesses. All Heard has is: “Because I say so.” That doesn’t fly in an unbiased court of law.</p>
<p>There are so many connections between Heard and  Justice Nicol that it would take me all day to chase them down. Stevie J Raw did a great job of it today in his live chat.

<p>There's so much wrong with this that reaches far beyond one role - or two, now that he's lost Pirates as well. In the end, Johnny will prevail. He's currently appealing the verdict against him. It's very likely that he'll win the appeal, and his upcoming defamation case against ex wife Amber Heard, too. He's still got film roles coming in, his band the Hollywood Vampires is rock and rolling along. Besides which, he has the love and support of the entire world. If anything, the verdict has brought the world closer together in their support of this wrongfully persecuted man.</p>
<p>But the damage is done. Not just to Johnny, but every male survivor of domestic abuse. By finding against Johnny and his preponderance of evidence in the face of Heard's abysmal lack of evidence, by saying that he believed Amber Heard because she's a woman, the judge has made it impossible for abused men to come forward in search of support.</p>
<p>And by dumping Johnny, WB sends the message that they support abusers, and have no support whatsoever for the true victim. That's not acceptable, and we must come together and raise our voices.</p>
<p>Let's send WB the message that we DO support not just Johnny Depp but every survivor of domestic support, including Men. Demand that Warner Bros do the right thing brings back Johnny Depp back in his iconic role of Gellart Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. </p>

<p>“Shut down this pathetic petition, Justice for Amber! Support women shame on you Jeanne.”</p>
<p>That right there is exactly what’s wrong with what’s going on right now. Amber Heard expecting people to believe her just because she’s a woman.</p>
<p>“Tell the world, Johnny. Tell them I Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim too of domestic violence... and see how many people believe or side with you.""</p>
<p>And at first, she was right. People did side with her just because she’s a woman. Even in the recent verdict in Johnny Depp’s libel case against the Sun, the judge ridiculously said that even though Johnny had the preponderance of evidence, he was choosing to believe Amber Heard. What woman would lie about being the victim of domestic abuse, right?</p>
<p>Well, we know the answer to that one, don't we?</p>
<p>Heard may be celebrating right now, but the libel case isn’t over. Not by a long shot. Johnny and his team have 21 days from the verdict date to appeal the verdict. And, according to Johnny’s legal team, the verdict is so absurd that it’s unthinkable not to appeal.</p>
<p>I can neither confirm nor deny that such an appeal will take place, so I’ll just suppose that it will. And if it does, the verdict must certainly be overturned.</p>
<p>Regarding Justice Nicol, it’s rumored that his wife is BFFs with one of Amber’s lawyers. If that’s true, can we say “conflict of interest” much?</p>
<p>As for me, no. I won’t support women just because they’re women. I will support VICTIMS no matter what gender they are. I support Johnny, a male victim of domestic abuse. I hope his verdict is overturned, so that men in the UK and around the world can feel safer coming forward seeking support. Nobody should feel so victimized by society that they can’t get help.</p>

<p>What absolute rubbish.</p>
<p>Netizens are in an outrage, calling for the removal of the judge (who I will not name here) to be removed from the bench and investigated for potential bribery. One Twitter user said: ""I smell a muskrat.""</p>
<p>We'll never know why the verdict came down the way it did. We just have to remember that this is just one battle. The war isn't over.

Waldman was admitted pro hac vice — for this case only — to Fairfax County Circuit Court in September 2019. That means the Waldman, who practices in Washington, was given permission to represent Johnny in Virginia.</p>
<p>That same month, Judge White signed a protective order governing the treatment of Depp and Heard’s personal information — passport numbers, phone numbers and the like, as well as medical records, including psychological conditions, diagnoses or treatment. </p>
<p>Heard had moved for sanctions against the Washington attorney last month, contending that the press leaks happened “on at least two occasions.”</p>
<p>She said Waldman was responsible for disseminating audio recordings, surveillance pictures and declarations from third-party witnesses to websites and Twitter users.</p>
<p>In court on Friday, Heard’s lawyers accused Waldman of spreading false rumors about their client.  </p>
<p>White, who is chief judge of the 19th Circuit, agreed Friday to revoke Waldman’s pro hac vice status. Despite finding that ethical standards were violated, the judge declined to issue a gag order against Waldman.  </p>
<p>While it’s easy to see this as a defeat, it’s not. Not at all. Johnny has be represented by Virginia lawyer Benjamin Chew throughout these proceedings thus far, and he’ll continue to do a fine job. After all, whoever presents them, the facts are still the facts, and Amber Heard is still sunk by them. She can’t get everybody fired.</p>
<p>Besides, now that Adam Waldman isn’t constrained by the orders of the case anymore, he can say and do whatever he wants. The judge didn’t issue a gag order remember, and Waldman knows EVERYTHING about the case. While I’m sure he wouldn’t do anything to hurt Johnny – he’s still Johnny’s lawyer – he’s now free to talk about any little thing.</p>
<p>Heard may see this as a victory, but the truth is that she may have shot herself in the food on this one. Waldman’s free to talk, now, and I for one can’t wait to see what he’s got to say.</p>

Hound lovers may recall that during the Pirates of the Caribbean star’s libel case against The Sun newspaper, Depp’s former employee told the court he was forced to lie under oath about the dogs’ illegal entry into Queensland. Heard’s former assistant also claimed the actor “deliberately smuggled the dogs into Australia.”</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Heard avoided conviction in April 2016 after she pleaded guilty to giving Customs a false document. But she and Depp were forced to film a hostage video, sorry, biosecurity apology. </p>
<p>The department is investigating if any criminal offences under commonwealth legislation have been committed relating to the testimony provided to the High Court in London. As the matter is the subject of a current investigation the department is unable to provide any further comment at this time.</p>
<p>The maximum penalty for perjury in Queensland? Fourteen years in jail. “Is the defense for perjury that you have got to be able to act?” Joyce zinged. “What is the point of having laws if they are not pursued?”</p>
<p>That’s right, folks. Heard could face up to 14 years in jail for one count of perjury alone.</p>
<p>That doesn’t even begin to touch the time she could serve if Johnny filed a complaint about his finger and had her thrown in jail for assault resulting in grievous bodily injury. If he did that, we wouldn’t have to be bothered with Miss Thang for quite a while.</p>
<p>I don’t know why Johnny hasn’t filed a complaint yet for that finger incident, but I wish he would, and make her face justice for it, once and for all.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should Johnny put Heard in jail for cutting off his finger? Or should he let sleeping dogs lie?</p>

119,StarterPetitionUpdate,27902300,2020-10-16T18:48:02.000Z,,Amber Heard bullies Johnny Depp,"<p>Johnny Depp is ordered to appear for three successive days in counsel for the defendant’s offices on November 10th, 11th, and 12th, beginning at 10am. And he has to pay her the cost of filing this motion, as well as whatever other reasonable costs apply.</p>
<p>So, basically, Johnny has to pay Amber for bullying him into interrupting filming in London in order to appear in Virginia for a deposition that easily could have waited until after his filming was concluded.</p>
<p>Let’s keep in mind that it’s not just three days at stake. There are quarantine periods as well. So it’s not just a matter of days that filming is being disrupted by. It could be weeks.</p>
<p>While I’m sure it’s Amber’s intention to jerk Johnny around – maybe even get him fired from FB3 – she’s also meddling with WB, forcing them to reschedule Johnny’s filming and having to film around him. Is this something she’d pull if she were still affiliated with Aquaman 2? I don’t think so. She wouldn’t risk her status with them if she still had the part.</p>
<p>Heard might be feeling all victorious right about now, winning this little battle. But one battle doesn’t win the war, and she will not win this one. The verdict will come down from London soon about Depp’s libel case against the Sun for calling him a wife beater, and when it does, the whole world will be put on notice that the courts aren’t buying her story about being a battered wife. The court in London won’t buy it, and neither will the court in Virginia.</p>
<p>She can enjoy what little bit of money she gets from Johnny right now, right up until she’s forced to pay him $50 million for his defamation case. Since she’s not worth that much to begin with, it’ll be interesting to see where she gets the money.</p>
<p>She can enjoy pushing him around for now, too. Because while she’s getting her way this time, she does no control Johnny Depp any more. He caught wise to what kind of a monster she really is, and kicked her to the curb. Sure, he’ll have to sit for the deposition, but she will not be the one asking questions. She shouldn’t even be in the room, though I’m sure she’ll find a way to insert herself so that she can stare him down and witness his defeat. But that’s the end of it. He’s moved on with his life and regained his happiness. And no matter how much she thinks she can push him around, she can’t take that away from him. Never again.</p>
<p>And she can go ahead and enjoy breathing free air, while she can. She’s got several chances to be thrown behind bars hanging over her head. First, there’s no statute of limitations in Australia for violence that results in grievous bodily harm. Like cutting off somebody’s finger. The only reason she hasn’t been brought up on charges is because Johnny hasn’t filed a claim against her. She owes the fact that she’s not in jail right now to the man she’s pushing around. She needs to think about that.</p>
<p>Second, Australia’s looking at her for Perjury in the case where she brought the yorkies, Pistol and Boo, into the country illegally. She lied in her statement to authorities, and now they know it.</p>
<p>And, depending on how the verdict comes down in London, she could very well be facing perjury charges there, too. She lied her ass off in her testimony to the British courts, just like she’s lied for the past four years about Johnny.</p>
<p>Will they seek perjury charges in Virginia after she lies there, too? They certainly could. So let her do her little victory dance at this perceived victory. She won’t be laughing when it’s all over.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will the London judge rule in favor of Depp or Heard? What do you think will happen in Virginia? Will Heard manage to pull another rabbit out of her hat? Or will Johnny prevail, clearing his name and forcing her to face justice? Drop a comment and let us know.</p>

<p>If I were so inclined, I could post pictures of the inane things Amber Heard's been up to, from riding her horse, and a lesson horse, badly with the wrong tack, to her hanging her nipples out for the world to see (again) in that same see-through top that she wore to meet Jason Momoa and a gaggle of kids for an Aquaman event.</p>
<p>But I'm not so inclined. It's not news, even if these base, nonsensical tidbits get posted in the Daily Fail (mail) tabloid.</p>
<p>I have to wonder who she's got on her payroll to get them to post her non-event, inappropriate photos. SOMEbody's got to be getting paid for that. It also makes me wonder who's footing the bill. She got paid not to appear in Aquaman 2, so she's got a little bit of money. But she lives outside her means, and somebody's got to be picking up the tab. </p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll hear a ruling soon. Then we can celebrate, since Johnny is certain to win. And then we can look forward to the Virginia case, which Johnny is also certain to win, hands down. Heard spend years portraying herself as the victim of Depp's abuse, when the truth is that she was the abusive one. He lost his job as Captain Jack Sparrow due to her allegations. It's only right that he should be compensated for it. </p>

<p>First, she fails to state a claim for declaratory judgement. In her opposition, Ms. Heard fails to state a single case recognizing the viability of a standalone claim for a declaratory judgement. Basically, she's outta gas because of anti-SLAPP statutes.</p>
<p>Second, Ms. Heard fails to allege computer crimes under the VA code. She can't cite where the alleged ""smear campaign"" is immoral or unlawful. Further, she can't prove that anything said by Mr. Depp was obscene or illegal as it relates directly to her.</p>
<p>And third, calling someone a liar isn't defamation. Especially if they've already been proven to be a liar.</p>
<p>In short, Heard's counterclaim is a whole bunch of her being butthurt, without any legal substance. </p>

128,StarterPetitionUpdate,27796435,2020-09-27T19:20:35.000Z,,Amber Heard goes after Johnny Depps attorney,"<p>In her latest motions, Amber Heard asks the court to sanction Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp’s lawyer, preventing him from communicating with the press, social media, or any potential third party witnesses about this case. In short, she doesn’t want Waldman to post on Twitter.</p>
<p>She says that “Throughout this litigation, Mr. Waldman has acted like anything but an attorney this Court has a right to expect.”</p>
<p>In her memorandum, Heard insists that Mr. Depp has defamed her through Mr. Waldman’s statements as Mr. Depp’s agent, and has orchestrated a robust social media campaign against her through the use of inauthentic social media accounts (i.e. not real accounts by real people) casting aspersions on Heard while often praising Mr. Depp and Mr. Waldman. The conduct for which Defendant now seeks sanctions is related but distinct from the conduct alleged in Heard’s counterclaims.</p>
<p>What that means is that this isn’t the same assertion she made in her counterclaim, this is a completely new motion asking the court to make Mr. Waldman stop posting on social media.</p>
<p>More than that, it looks like she’s trying to get Adam Waldman thrown off the case all together, saying that “the court has the right to revoke the pro had admission of Depp’s lawyer (Waldman), if his behavior on social media adversely impacts the administration of justice.”</p>
<p>Admission pro hac vice is when a lawyer from another jurisdiction is allowed to practice in another area. Virginia isn’t Adam Waldman’s normal stomping ground, so Heard wants him thrown off the case.</p>
<p>The reasons she says he should be dismissed aren’t just his actions on social media. She also blames Waldman for leaking Josh Dre’s deposition transcript. She goes on and on about Waldman on Twitter, having puppies and kittens about other “leaked” materials and laundered information.</p>
<p>What it really means is that Waldman’s doing his job, Heard can’t stand it, and she’s doing everything she can to get rid of him.</p>
<p>It also looks like she’s so jealous of Johnny’s popularity on social media that she can’t see straight. He gets hundreds of thousands of “likes” on his Instagram posts, none of which have had a single thing to do with her.</p>
<p>On top of asking for all these sanctions, Heard also asks the court to award her the cost of filing these motions in the first place. She wants to fling mud at Depp and his legal team, and she wants Depp to pay for her to do it. Talk about nerve.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will she be successful in getting rid of Adam Waldman? Or will the court tell her to sit down and shut up? Yeah, me too.</p>

Specifically, she’s going to have to prove how much of her divorce settlement was actually donated to charity, where it went and how much.</p>
<p>From court documents:  </p>
<p>“Second, discovery into whether Heard did, in fact, as she publicly claims, donate her $7 million divorce settlement to charity, is relevant to Ms. Heard’s motive in making the domestic abuse allegations against Depp. Defendant proclaimed to the world that “money played no role” in her divorce with Mr. Depp, promising that all settlement proceeds would be donated to charity, particularly to vulnerable and abused populations. Mr. Depp should be able to show that Ms. Heard’s false abuse claims were to leverage a larger settlement, that she did not donate the entirety of the proceeds. In connection with a third-party subpoena pending before the Hon. Stephanie M. Bowick of California, that court has already tentatively agreed with Depp that Heard put her donations at issue, and that the truth of Heard’s claims to have donated the settlement proceeds is relevant and discoverable. This evidence is directly relevant to Heard’s motives, and the motion is nothing more than a blatant attempt by Heard to end run a well warranted adverse ruling in California.”</p>
<p>Depp’s legal team submitted a motion to discover whether or not Heard had actually donated all of the money, and Heard’s team objected. But in yet another win for Johnny, a judge agreed with him. Details about the settlement are relevant to Heard’s motives in making abuse allegations against Depp.</p>
<p>So, in short, Heard is going to have to prove where the divorce money went. Did she donate it? Did she donate part of it and keep the rest for herself? Did she donate any of it?</p>

<p>Anticipated. Not confirmed.</p>
<p>While WB might never make an official statement that Heard has been bought out and dropped from the film, there are a LOT of clues that hint at it, from a statement on court that Heard was SUPPOSED to be in AM2 to this, a statement from the film's director that doesn't confirm that she's in it. </p>
<p>The biggest clue of all might come from her countersuit against Johnny Depp, wherein she claims to have lost a total of $100 million in salary and damages because of him. The only major payday she had on the line was Aquaman. So she's saying she lost Aquaman 2 because of Johnny Depp, right?</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is due to be released on 16th December 2022. We might have to wait until then for proof that she's not in the film.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will it take the film coming out without her in it before you believe that she's out? Or are the clues enough?

<p>Depp was in San Sebastian to attend the premiere of ""Crock of Gold, directed by Julien Temple. The film combines unseen footage from the Pogues and MacGowan's family and is described as a 'celebration' of the star.</p>
<p>Depp is also scheduled to reprise his role of Gellart Grindelwald, with filming on Fantastic Beasts 3 to resume filming any day now. Filming should be finished just in time for Depp to gear up for his Defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, now scheduled to commence on May 17th, 2021.</p>
<p>By all accounts, Depp is staying busy, staying healthy and looking happy as he interacts with fans and gets on with his life. Congratulations to him for coming out the other side happy and whole.</p>

<p>She doesn’t want much, does she? Basically, she’s asking for any communication he ever had with anybody on the planet during that time that was about her.</p>
<p>She probably thinks that she’s going to find some incriminating morsel that she can wave around as proof that he’s a monster. But more likely, I think this fishing expedition is only going to find correspondence that corroborates Depp’s version of events.</p>
<p>Even more likely, Heard is asking for this staggering amount of communication to create even more of a paper blizzard to try to bury the facts in this case, that she defamed Johnny Depp by calling him a domestic abuser. No amount of paperwork is going to eradicate the fact that she’s doomed when it comes not only to the verdict in London, but in the VA defamation case as well.</p>
<p>See, when it comes to light that she perjured herself in London, that fact comes straight to Virginia, and applies directly to Depp’s defamation case against her.</p>
<p>It’s my guess that she’s trying to get ahead of the London verdict, which looms near, and kick up such a paperwork dust storm that she can hide her apparent guilt.</p>
<p>Not gonna work. But she’ll have to find that out for herself.</p>

<p>That's 4 weeks to wade through all of Heard's ridiculous accusations against Johnny Depp, and Johnny's mountain of evidence proving that she's a liar. And, more than that, that she was the abuser in the relationship. I know it and you know it, but Johnny's got to prove it to the judge and jury. Is 4 weeks long enough for all that?</p>
<p>That's something else that's different from the London trial. This one's marked to be a trial by jury at the request of both parties. Looks like Heard thinks that she can convince them with her horrible acting and obviously fake testimony.</p>
<p>They're already looking at Heard for Perjury in Australia. It's possible that the UK will be looking at her for Perjury once the London verdict comes down. I wonder what the sentence for perjury is in the United States, particularly Virginia. Anybody know?</p>
<p>The statute of limitations is over in America for everything Amber Did to Johnny, Tasya, Kate James, Whitney, and all the other victims she's left in her wake, so she won't do any time for any of those crimes. </p>
<p>There is no statute of limitations in Australia, though, for any assault resulting in grievous bodily harm. She will have the possibility of serving time in Australia for cutting Johnny's finger off for the rest of her life. </p>
<p>And, more recently, she's racking up quite a list of places where she can and should be charged for perjury. Oh, how I hope they take turns locking her up for it. </p>

137,StarterPetitionUpdate,27709502,2020-09-12T19:55:15.000Z,,Defamation trial delay granted,"<p>Fairfax County Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White has granted Johnny Depp’s request for a delay in his defamation trial against ex wife Amber Heard. The trial was set for Jan. 11, which coincides with the filming schedule for another installment of the “Fantastic Beasts” series in which Depp will star, prompting his lawyers to request a continuance last month. But Heard objected to the delay.  </p>
<p>According to Heard, she was told that Aquaman 2 would start filming in February, 2021. See that claim <a href=""https://depplady.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/delay1.jpg?w=740"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Problem is that she’s all wrong.</p>
<p>WB wrote a letter regarding both FB3 and AM2, which says that they “require Mr. Depp to be in the United Kingdom from September 17th 2020 through the anticipated end of production in mid-February 2021.”</p>
<p>“As to Aquaman 2, that film will not start production any earlier that May 31, 2021.”</p>
<p>Notice how they name Johnny Depp and specifically address his filming schedule. But they don’t name Amber Heard or address her filming schedule. They refer to AM2 as “that film” and make no reference to Heard at all.</p>
<p>It also goes to show that Heard is completely out of the loop with regard to AM2 production. She thought filming was going to start in February, when in fact, production is going to start months later. Seems to me if she were going to be involved with the movie, she would have been informed by now. All the principals have to know these things early so they can schedule accordingly.</p>
<p>From the look of it, Heard has no idea whatsoever what’s going on with AM2. If she were returning as Mera, she’d be in the loop.</p>
<p>I’m taking it as a good sign that Heard’s out of AM2, straight from the horse’s mouth.</p>

These include:</p>
<p>1. All documents or communications with Mr. Depp that refer or relate to Ms. Heard<br>2. All documents or communications concerning the relationship between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard, including, but not necessarily limited to any violence or abuse between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard.<br>3. All documents or communications concerning any actual, alleged, or attempted acts of violence involving Mr. Depp.<br>4. All documents or communications concerning any actual alleged, or attempted alcohol or drug use or abuse by Mr. Depp from 2013 to present.<br>5. All documents of communications concerning any actual or alleged act of Mr. Depp that resulted in damage to property.<br>6. All documents concerning any decision to cast or not cast Mr. Depp in any future Pirates of the Caribbean films.<br>7. All contracts with or relating to Mr. Depp relating to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.<br>8. All documents or communications relating to any interviews, communications, or correspondence with press or entertainment trade publications concerning Mr. Depp.<br>9. All non-privileged documents or communications concerning any insurance policy or claims relating to any performance by Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>I hardly know where to start. So I’ll just start at the top. Any communications with Depp that relate to Ms. Heard. Why the hell would there be any communication between Disney and Ms. Heard? Does Heard’s team think that Johnny regularly chatted up Disney about his marriage? That’s ridiculous. Disney isn’t any one person, it’s a legal entity that exists on many levels, none of which includes marriage counseling. If there’s any communication, it’s from Disney telling Johnny that his wife was banned from the set because she was such a troublemaker during filming.</p>
<p>Number 2, same thing. There’s no reason there would be communications between Johnny and Disney about Heard at all, let alone anything about violence. But this is a slippery slope for Heard. IF there were any communications about violence, they are most likely about her being violent, not him.</p>
<p>Number 3, asked and answered by number 2.</p>
<p>Number 4, any actual alleged, or attempted alcohol or drug use or abuse by Mr. Depp. First, it’s ridiculous to think that Disney babysat Johnny while he filmed, to know what he did or didn’t do or drink. It would only be addressed if any such substance abuse became a problem for filming. Johnny is a consummate professional. We’ve never heard that he was drunk on set. Just that he’s a delight to work with. And secondly, what the hell is ATTEMPTED alcohol or drug use? That’s such an absurd phrase that I’m surprised any lawyer dared to put such a silly thing in actual court papers. Well, I guess they’ll do anything they’re paid to do.</p>
<p>Number 5, Damage. What do they think? That Johnny wantonly went around smashing sets? For one thing, we would have heard about it in tabloids at the time. For another, Disney wouldn’t have kept employing him if he were prone to smashing things up. They didn’t dump him until Heard branded him as a wife-beater.</p>
<p>Number 6, Any decision to cast or recast him in future films. That’s not a legal argument, it’s a personal fishing expedition. Yes, Johnny’s asking for 50m because that’s what he’s out for losing Pirates, but it reads more like she’s just desperate to know what work he’ll be getting.</p>
<p>Number 7, Asked and answered by number 6.</p>
<p>Number 8, This is far too broad a request to be feasible. Any interviews, EVER, relating to Disney? Besides, what has his interviews got to do with her defaming him? This comes across as Amber trying to create such a fuss with Disney that they won’t want to work with Johnny because of her. I hope the studio, and the judge, see through this abusive tactic and sent her packing.</p>
<p>Number 9, any insurance policy or claims relating to any performance by Mr. Depp. I find this one to be really interesting. The way filming works is that actors have to be bonded, insured, in order to film. Can’t film without being insured. So we already know that Johnny was insured for all past jobs with Disney or they wouldn’t have happened. So this is another fishing expedition to find out if Johnny is insured for future projects, Pirates or otherwise. She’s desperate to know what work he might have lined up with Disney in the future. It reeks of her wanting to know so that she can muck it up for him. I also think this request for his insurance information is highly ironic, since Heard herself is uninsurable. It reads to me like she's saying, “If I can’t work, neither can he!”</p>
<p>Remind me again, who was the abuser here? Her supporters would say that he’s the abuser by insisting upon these two court cases: the libel case in London and the Defamation case against her in VA. But let’s not forget that during negotiations for their divorce, he BEGGED her to finish it up quietly to avoid court. He didn’t want to hurt her reputation, he wanted to let her walk away. But it was SHE who kept running her mouth to any outlet she could think of, or pay for, labeling him as an abusive spouse and painting herself as the poor, embattled victim. She tried to ruin him, and she’s still trying to ruin him. Only now, it’s not just the public that gets to decide. It’s a judge and a court, and they’re not as gullible as I’m sure she hopes they are. A few flimsy lies aren’t going to hold up. They’re too easily debunked, and that’s what’s going on. Johnny is presenting evidence that he didn’t do what she says he did. She’s just hoping that if she throws enough paperwork into the air, it’ll distract away from the evidence.</p>
<p>Sorry, kid, but it doesn’t work that way. Those judgments are coming, sooner than later. And there’s not going to be anywhere to hide.</p>
<p>All she’s managing to do with this little stunt of hers is ensure that Disney will never want to work with her. Johnny will be just fine once she’s legally forced to shut her yap. I, for one, can’t wait for that day.</p>

<p>As things stand right now, Depp is scheduled to sit for his deposition on October 5th, most likely via video link, though that's almost certain to change.</p>
<p>Depp has filed for a continuance to allow for his filming schedule for Fantastic Beasts 3. Heard, naturally, is having fits about it. She thinks that Depp should be able to schedule his filming around court obligations, saying that Depp ""has made no effort to schedule around his deposition and this trial. The case needs to end, and end soon.""</p>
<p>That's not the way things work, of course, but there's no telling Heard that. She claims that Johnny and his lawyer Adam Waldman are waging a ""campaign of terror"" against her by posting on social media, and she calls for this abuse to end as soon as possible. And never mind that it is she who's been slandering him by way of every public platform that she can think of (or pay for) since they divorced. For her, it seems, it's ""Do as I say, not as I do.""</p>
<p>The thing is, they want five days for Depp's deposition, which Depp's side has argued is too long. They are also refusing to allow him to depo in London via WebX because AH wants a lawyer there, which would require 14 day quarantine period. </p>
<p>So while Heard is screaming about postponements, SHE'S the one making it difficult for him to sit for his deposition. </p>

<p>“My impression of him was a very loving and very sensitive and very trustworthy person,” Rylance said of Depp. “Intensely, intensely shy. You know? Like Daniel Day-Lewis and so many great actors are. The accusations that were around at the time we were making the film were of physical violence. And he obviously denied this and I found his denial completely believable. It didn’t seem to be part of his character at all.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Snoop Dogg is feeling the Johnny love.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see more and more people stepping forward with support for Johnny Depp. I think it’s finally sinking in that he was the innocent party, and that Amber Heard is the one who was abusive in the relationship.</p>
<p>Hell, she still is being abusive, asking to be informed about just about every minute of every day of his life. She’s even demanding his call sheets for filming, which are usually not even typed up until the day before filming. She’s contacting WB about him, demanding information. It seems to me that she’s trying to pester WB into firing Johnny because SHE’S too much of a pain in the arse for them to keep dealing with.</p>
<p>And that begs the question: IF Amber were still an Aquaman, how would this pestering bode for her. Nah, folks. This sounds like somebody who’s got nothing to lose from WB, meaning she’s already out of Aquaman.</p>
<p>It also comes across as Amber being insanely jealous that Johnny still has his blockbuster franchise, while she’s out of hers.</p>
<p>Maybe she should have thought of that before she beat the shit out of Johnny and then caused herself to be unbondable. She might still have the job.</p>

She says that his need to work is not “good cause” for a continuance, and that if the court grants one, it will set a “highly problematic” precedent. He could, and should have worked his filming schedule around his deposition instead. She thinks, apparently, that Depp has the power to make a multi-million dollar film, its cast, crew, and schedule revolve around him, at her whim.</p>
<p>Doesn’t work that way. It would cost millions for the movie to wait for him to go to court, if that were even possible. Court is flexible. Filming a movie is not.</p>
<p>Heard also says that it is of the utmost importance that the trial proceed as scheduled so that she can put a stop to Depp’s “daily” smear campaign of her through social media.</p>
<p>More than that, she bemoans the cost of maintaining her legal defense for an additional five months, the amount of time Depp is seeking.</p>
<p>She says that requesting a continuance, in part, because of Covid protocols, shouldn’t happen because even though it is good cause, it’s already been done twice. Apparently, she thinks twice is enough, and never mind that the pandemic is far from being resolved.</p>
<p>With regard to filming schedules, Heard says that she was told that Aquaman was going to start filming sometime in the spring – WB didn’t tell her exactly when. So, if she’s in the movie, a continuance would interfere with HER filming schedule.</p>
<p>We already know that she’s not in Aquaman 2, and she knows it, too. She’s pulling this out of her arse just to try to deny his request for a continuance. I mean, I can be TOLD that Aquaman is filming in the spring. That doesn’t mean I’ll be in it. Doesn’t mean she will, either. And for them not to tell her exactly when filming starts is a huge red flag. Johnny’s known for months ahead of time when FB3 was going to start filming. Certainly, if she was going to be in a blockbuster, she’d know when she was supposed to show up to film it so that she could arrange her schedule accordingly.</p>
<p>Heard went on to slam Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp’s lawyer, claiming that he’s done all sorts of things that are improper, maybe even illegal, based on social media posts that she doesn’t like.</p>
<p>I think my favorite line is when she says that she “intends to vindicate herself at trial.” Just like she did in London? Because that was just one big Charlie Foxtrot for her.</p>
<p>Every day that passes, she insists, provides further opportunity for Depp and Waldman to smear her good name, tarnish her reputation, and irreparably damage her career, which has long been Depp’s stated goal.</p>

<p>Will she name Aquaman 2 among the work she's lost, admitting that she's not coming back to the water world? Or will she hold fast to the flimsy rumor that she's still going to be in it?</p>
<p>Don't forget, we've got it on good authority that WB bought out Heard's contract, sending her to the bench. Meaning that she got paid, but will not appear in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>No, there hasn't been any official confirmation that she's out, and there likely won't be. The movie will simply come out without her in it. I wish there would be official word, but that's just not always the way it works, I'm sorry to say.</p>
<p>What other work will she be able to prove that Depp cost her through his false smear campaign to ruin her reputation on social media? Including the formation and manipulation of this very petition - according to her. What other movies did she have lined up that we bots have made her lose?</p>
<p>Word has it that she's unbondable. That means that she can't be insured during the production of a film. Without insurance, there's no part. Period. So, if that's the case, how is Johnny responsible? How are we?</p>

<p>The reason for the postponement is that Fantastic Beasts 3 is going to be filming from October this year until February of next year. So Johnny has asked for a postponement until May or June of 2021. </p>

<p>During the DCFanDome panel, Aquaman 2 director James Wan discussed how the second film would expand upon the world of Jason Momoa's Aquaman. The director also stated that he was excited to continue the journeys of their heroes and expand their world in the second chapter.</p>
<p>Actor Patrick Wilson, who played King Orm, also discussed what he wanted from Aquaman 2 during the panel at DCFanDome. Patrick Wilson mentioned that he wanted the second movie to explore more of the ocean and explore “some new worlds”.</p>
<p>neither James Wan nor Patrick Wilson spoke about Heard's role in the sequel. The director and actor noticeably avoided talking about Amber Heard and the current controversy surrounding her. For those unaware, many fans want Amber Heard removed from Aquaman 2 due to her ongoing legal battle with Johnny Depp. </p>
<p>In fact, fans even started a petition online asking for Amber Heard's removal from the movie. As of now, WB and the makers of Aquaman 2 have not yet commented on Amber Heard's role in the movie. Aquaman 2 is set to release sometime in December of 2022. </p>
<p>Throughout the panel discussion, clips of the first Aquaman showed, including behind the scenes content about the making of the movie. But not once did they show a single image of Amber Heard. </p>
<p>That leaves conspicuously unanswered the question of whether Amber Heard will return as Mera in AM2. We have heard from reputable sources, however, that WB bought out Heard's contract, quietly giving her the boot from the franchise. By all accounts, Amber Heard will not be returning for AM2. </p>
<p>Will they write Mera out? A<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u77M-oANRtQ"" rel=""nofollow""> teaser</a> for the Snyder Cut of Justice League shows Aquaman bowing out on Mera, like ""See ya"" - hinting perhaps that her exit will be predicted there. </p>

In it, she makes some pretty outlandish claims, saying that this petition is fake, and that so are many of the people who signed it. She calls you conspicuously fake and highly suspicious.</p>
<p>Remember when she called us all bots? Well, apparently she’s holding that position, while saying that not only are we bots, but that we’re bots on a Russian payroll.</p>
<p>She says: ""These accounts exhibit behavior which includes but is not limited to tweet to retweet ratios in numbers implausible for authentic human users; they are created, attack Ms. Heard, then are set to inactive to avoid suspension; they utilize common language, patterns, and timing indicating broad coordination; they often offer little or no personal information, suggesting computer-control or a single individual controlling more than one account at a time (and often many more); and they republicize the content of one another at rates and consistencies that bely authentic human control.""</p>
<p>Well, no kidding. They exhibit common language, timing and patterns because they’re all talking about the same topic, the TRUTH that Amber Heard abused Johnny Depp. There’s no collusion behind that. It’s the simple truth.</p>
<p>And as far as offering little to no personal information, it must REALLY bug her that she can’t find out who a few of you are. Good. Let her wonder who in the industry isn’t a bot and knows the truth about her that they aren’t shy to share.</p>
<p>She goes on to say: ""These accounts are designed to damage Ms. Heard and her livelihood without being directly traceable to Mr. Depp. For example, it appears that a significant number of the accounts signing the petition to remove Ms. Heard from the Aquaman franchise are conspicuously fake or highly suspicious. The use of fake signatures on these petitions is well outside the skill set of the average internet troll or disgruntled fan. They reflect a concerted effort to damage Ms. Heard. In addition, the change.org petitions were modified to make it appear that far more people signed the petitions than actually did.""</p>
<p>She says: ""There are a number of newly created foreign language accounts specifically or predominantly designed to damage Ms. Heard. Many of these accounts have Cyrillic signatures, reflecting Russian origin. Mr. Waldman, Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, is publicly associated with Russian individuals with the capability to organize such attacks.""</p>
<p>She’s also attacking netizens on Twitter, calling out accounts for being fake. These include, ReemDepp, MyGrindelwald, Mderndarkwizard, pomta5426, depp_oldiar, PerspectiveDepp, depphead_, RayRayDepp, Depplyyours, ILoveGellert, Jackiedepp1963, JDeppS_girl.</p>

Likewise, modest clothing should be worn at holy places. Heard wore what she calls a head scarf, but has half her hair hanging out. She also shows her neck and cleavage. To top it off, she’s braless in a sheer dress that clearly shows her nipples.</p>
<p>She got called out on it from netizens, most of whom found it to be extremely disrespectful for her to appear this way in a place of worship. Muslim commenters found her actions to be unforgivable.</p>
<p>Amber Heard has struck back. She writes: 'Nope. Apparently whoever paid 4 this to b “written” wasnt paid enough. 'Ill make it easy(ier): Mosques are real places. So are museums &amp; churches. So are head scarfs (where they are sometimes required n order 2 visit). Mystery solved.'</p>
<p>First, she calls out the reporter for how the article is “written” then goes on to babble incoherently herself in gibberish that’s barely legible. She has little room to talk.</p>
<p>Second, the plural of scarf is scarves. Scarfs is loose slang for when one eats rapidly. And, more importantly, it’s not a simple head scarf. It’s a hijab, which when worn properly has social and religious meaning. She is obviously clueless not just about what it’s called, but what it represents.</p>
<p>Further, yes. Mosques are real places. They are places of worship which should be treated with respect. That respect does, indeed, require “head scarfs” to be worn, not just as fashion accessories for photo ops, but to be worn properly to show the place and the people the respect they deserve. By refusing to do that, she shows a staggering level of disrespect.</p>
<p>Her dress is likewise abysmally disrespectful, with her nipples clearly showing through. She was wearing a jacket which she could easily have pulled closed around her chest for modesty. But it’s clear that she has none. And there’s nothing wrong with that bohemian attitude on the streets of Soho, perhaps. But in a place of worship where people were praying, a place where modesty is expected, it goes down like a lead balloon.</p>
<p>It’s clear that her trip to the mosque was nothing more than a photo op. And when she got called on it, she’s completely without remorse. She lashes out like a child at the people that criticized her. She had a chance to learn something and be humble, even apologize, but instead chose to show her true colors. Vindictive and childish.</p>
<p>I, for one, just can’t wait for the judgement to come down in London, the first nail in her career coffin. Then for the judgement against her in Virginia, which will be the finish of her. Not that she really needs those judgments to finish her off. Word has it that not only is she removed from Aquaman 2, but that she’s also blacklisted. Nobody wants to work with her. And I don’t blame them. She comes across as a spoiled, selfish, abusive brat. Who wants to work with that?</p>

<p>As you can see, Whitney Heard isn’t the sweet, innocent little victim of her sister’s abuse. I have no doubt that her sister treats her at least as badly as she did Johnny Depp, but she’s certainly not the sweet little angel.</p>
<p>Whitney’s a grown woman with the world at her feet. She’s got a husband and son at home, yet she chooses to traipse around the world with her sister, perjuring herself to try and clean up her sister’s mess. Shows where her priorities lie.</p>

156,StarterPetitionUpdate,27471763,2020-08-07T14:43:14.000Z,,Johnny orchestrated this petition?,"<p>I was surprised and laughed hysterically when Amber Heard's team accused Johnny Depp of orchestrating this petition in recent court testimony in London. Johnny Depp is suing the Sun tabloid for calling him a wife-beater, remember. And Amber's team brought it up. Johnny was forced to answer about it. </p>
<p>I didn't realize that Johnny or Amber were even aware of our little petition until then. </p>
<p>I keep seeing articles repeating the same notion, that Johnny Depp colluded with me to start this thing. <a href=""https://blindgossip.com/throw-another-log-on-this-legal-fire/"" rel=""nofollow"">Another one</a> came out just the other day. I still think it's hysterical, but the ore I see it, the more I wonder. Am I going to have to testify that I alone started this thing? The more she pushes, the more I think I might actually have to.</p>
<p>Not that I mind at all. I started this thing for a specific reason, and I still have a clear conscience about it. I do not believe that a serial abuser should be celebrated in the entertainment industry. I said it on the front page and I still believe it. If I'm called to the stand, that's exactly what I'll say. </p>
<p>And if they ask me why I write under the name Jeannie Depp, I'll tell them. It has more to do with me than him. (I simply didn't want my ex to see his name on my work anymore, so I chose another name to use, one that I hoped would best serve my work.)</p>
<p>If they want to twist that into something ugly, I can't stop them. All I can do is tell the truth. Unlike the defendant, I haven't done anything that I should be ashamed of.</p>

Especially considering the amount of time the movie will need in post to make it look like all those people are underwater. </p>
<p>So, will Amber be among the cast? Some sources say that WB bought out Amber's contract so that she got paid but won't be in it. (which I believe.) Others say that she's set to reprise her role as Mera. </p>
<p>There's another thing to consider. Filming will take place in Australia. And if Barnaby Joyce has his way, there might be perjury charges over Pistol and Boo waiting for her there if she returns. </p>
<p>And there's no statute of limitations in Australia for crimes that involve grievous bodily injury, so she can still face charges over what happened to Johnny's finger. </p>

158,StarterPetitionUpdate,27443101,2020-08-03T19:48:35.000Z,,Perjury over Pistol and Boo,"<p>Barnaby Joyce, Johnny Depp’s biggest fan (not) is demanding that Amber Heard be probed over statements she made when she was charged with smuggling the toy Yorkies Pistol and Boo into Australia. There are strict laws about bringing animals into Australia without a quarantine period, and Heard volated them when she brought the dogs into the country on the couple’s private jet. She got out of jail time by agreeing to make a public service announcement about how important the country’s bio-laws are. You can see the cringe-worthy video HERE.</p>
<p>Now, Barnaby Joyce is demanding that Amber Heard be probed for perjury after allegedly telling an assistant to lie about bringing her two dogs illegally into Australia at the time. <br>Depp's former assistant of eight years, Kevin Murphy, said Heard made him lie under oath when they were accused of bringing in the dogs illegally. Mr Murphy claimed Heard told him: 'I want your help on this. I wouldn't want you to have a problem with your job'. The assistant said he had told the actress several times over the phone, email and in person she was unable to bring the dogs. <br>Paperwork and the required ten day quarantine period had not been arranged for Pistol and Boo.</p>
<p>Barnaby Joyce is calling the whole thing Dodgy ', saying that Depp and Heard were “just treating the whole thing as a joke. They had no regard for the law as they had no regard for biosecurity laws,' Mr Joyce said. And now he wants Amber Heard to pay for it. He’s got no love lost for Johnny Depp, but it was Amber Heard that smuggled the dogs.</p>
<p>“The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is aware of recent media reports concerning the prosecution of Ms Amber Heard in Australia in 2016 and is consulting with the CDPP (Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecution) on this issue,” a spokesperson told Strewth. After a bit of sniffing around, senior sources informed us an investigation was potentially on the cards. The maximum penalty for perjury in Queensland? Fourteen years in jail.</p>
<p>14 years. That’s nothing to play with.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard be tried and convicted in Australia on top of her legal woes with Johnny Depp? Me, I hope so. I hope so a lot.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Barnaby Joyce was Agricultural Minister of Australia when Amber Heard was charged with smuggling Pistol and Boo into the country in October, 2015. He told the dogs to buggar off back to America and threatened to euthanize them.</p>
<p>Well, Barny obviously hasn’t forgotten about Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. He told 60 minutes Australia: “Hey, Johnny, look where your life ended up, old trout! They might be royalty in Hollywood, but we don’t give a toss about that.”</p>
<p>From the beginning, the Aussie documentary seemed heavily slanted toward Amber Heard’s version of events, showing pictures of Johnny sleeping on the floor and sleeping on the couc”h covered in her ice cream, her incessant blathering about how he beat her up and pulled out clumps of her hair.</p>
<p>I watched, waiting for the show to give Johnny equal time, but it didn’t really happen. While the show didn’t try to predict the outcome of Johnny’s libel trial against the Sun, they did say with certainty that everybody involved walks away “stained.”</p>
<p>Me, I disagree. Throughout the course of the trial, with all the evidence being made public every day, there has been an increasing outpouring of support for Johnny Depp, while Amber Heard’s public opinion took a heavy nose dive. People waited outside to give Johnny flowers, while all Amber got was boos. I think Johnny will walk away vindicated, win or lose. The world knows what she did to him, now, and there’s no going back from that.</p>
<p>I’ll give the show some credit, though. While they played Amber’s whining about being abused, they did show pictures of Johnny’s actual injuries, albeit fleetingly, and playing the tape where Amber admits to hitting Johnny repeatedly.</p>
<p>They made repeated use out of that TMZ video, where Johnny was kicking cabinets, as that’s just about the only “evidence” Amber’s team could present that he was ever violent. And I was less than thrilled when it was thrown out there that Johnny might have shat in his own bed and said that he was self-immolating by bringing the libel proceedings.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the show insinuated that both Johnny and Amber are guilty, and that they’re both damaged, no matter who wins.</p>
<p>What the show seems to forget is that this case isn’t between Johnny and Amber. THIS case is between Johnny Depp and the Sun tabloid. Amber was just a witness. So there’s no way that Amber Heard can win, here. I’m sure she’d claim victory for herself if the Sun prevails, but such really is not the case. Despite her narcissistic need for attention, not everything is about her.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest, I didn’t finish watching the show. With about 10 minutes left, I decided that I’d seen enough of the both-blaming game they were playing.</p>

In her statement, she said that after her divorce, she just wanted to move on with her life, and that reliving her marriage’s breakup was “incredibly painful.”</p>
<p>I cry BS. If she just wanted to move on with her life, she wouldn’t have made all those comments about being the victim of domestic violence, which we now know is completely untrue. She wouldn’t have written that WaMo op-ed that got her sued in the first place.</p>
<p>She also said that she would have preferred not to be here in court. Again, I say rubbish. She didn’t have to be there all day every day. She only needed to appear to testify. That was two or three days out of three weeks, but she insisted upon showing up every day.</p>

162,StarterPetitionUpdate,27399739,2020-07-28T13:45:48.000Z,,Team Depp's closing arguments,"<p>Here it is, folks, the final day of court. Amber arrived back in her school marm mode, all black from head to toe. She couldn’t resist trying to sex it up a bit though, with a sky-high slit up the front of her skirt. Johnny’s in a grey suit, looking in good spirits ahead of closing arguments on his behalf. Fans had flowers and artwork and chanted “Justice for Johnny!” in support for him. He, in turn, handed out thank you notes and bandanas to the crowd as a thank you for their support throughout this entire ordeal. What a sweetheart.</p>
<p>David Sherborne spoke out on behalf of Johnny today, starting with a much-needed reminder not to lose focus on why we’re all here. It’s not this Depp v Heard drama; that will be settled in Virginia in early 2021. What we’re here for is to decide whether or not the Sun tabloid libeled Johnny Depp when they called him a “wife-beater” on the front cover and continued to portray him as such in the article. That’s it. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>The burden of proof, Sherborne said, falls to the Sun to prove that the article was true. And frankly, everything they’ve tried to pull throughout the course of this trial just doesn’t fly. Every accusation of violence save one depends solely upon the fact that Amber Heard says so. They didn’t put forth a shred of evidence that wasn’t easily debunked.</p>
<p>The one accusation of violence is the “stairs” incident, at which Heard’s sister Whitney was supposedly present. And Whitney is obviously biased. Whether through loyalty to her sister or fear of retaliation, Whitney supported Heard’s version of events, even though that was easily debunked, too. Heard’s own medical history proves that she was never injured. All those doctors and nurses aren’t lying.</p>
<p>Heard was the abuser in the relationship, Sherborne points out. And Johnny’s not only got physical and medical evidence to support that, he’s got a myriad of witnesses who saw her being violent toward him. And, to top it all off, he’s got Heard on tape confessing to it. That’s pretty cut and dried.</p>
<p>Over and over throughout the course of the trial, Heard has gotten caught in one lie after the next. She lied about the dogs in Australia, she lied to Homeland security, and she’s lied about every single incident where she claims Johnny Depp abused her. Each and every lie was categorically debunked and exposed. That completely shatters any credibility she had going in, which wasn’t much to begin with.</p>
<p>Now it goes to the judge, and there’s no telling how long he’ll take to reach a decision. It could be tomorrow, or it could take weeks. Given the complexity and sheer volume of testimony and evidence there is to consider, I think it’ll take some time.

<p>Counsel for NGN basically rehashed everything that Team Amber spewed forth throughout the trial, that Johnny Depp is a monster, out of control on drink and drugs, potentially unaware of just how bad he really is. Depp really is the wife-beating monster Amber Heard made him out to be, they say. And, according to NGN, Depp is the deflector, accusing Heard of every terrible thing HE did, not the other way around.</p>
<p>That seemed to be their biggest tactic, deflecting all of Heard’s bad deeds back onto him. Aside from painting her as the poor little damsel in distress, that is. Another favorite fallback for them seems to be saying that poor little Amber was too tiny to have inflicted so much damage onto Johnny. She only weighed 115, they say. She COULDN’T have done it, they say.</p>
<p>Bullshit, I say.</p>

<p>Team Depp hit the ground running today. Of major interest, David Sherborne introduced evidence that proved that Whitney was lying when she testified that she did not know her sister to be violent. It’s a transcript of  a recording - given to his team last night - which shows that Ms Henriquez does have knowledge of Heard being violent. So, Boom. Whitney’s testimony is tainted. <br>Earlier in the week, Amber said that she rarely (Never?) goes outside without makeup, but testimony was given today by Amber’s acting coach Kristina Sexton that she rarely wore makeup in the daytime, if ever. And that when she did, it was light. Describing Heard's routine, Ms Sexton says: ""She wore very little. Just foundation, or lip or cheek tint if it was daytime... If it was an evening event, someone would do her make-up for her."" So, again. Boom.<br>I have a feeling we’re going to see a lot of those today.  <br>Sexton also shredded other of Amber’s testimony. For example, testifying that she never saw Johnny be violent, but only repeats what Amber said because she has no reason to lie to her. Bitch, please. Amber’s nothing BUT a lie. <br>Ms Laws says that Heard told Ms Sexton: ""Johnny will never let me go, he would rather destroy me than let me go"". Ms Laws asks Ms Sexton if she's aware that while Heard was telling her about the alleged domestic abuse, Heard was also contacting Depp and telling him he could stop the whole divorce process if he wanted. <br>Ms Sexton says she was not aware of this. <br>Ms. Sexton reported that Amber was worried about bad publicity over her split with Depp, because, sure. That’s what any normal woman would be thinking. Of course not. Any survivor of such horrid domestic abuse that she said she suffered at his hands would be relieved to be out of the line of fire.</p>
<p>Johnny arrived a half-hour late this morning, perhaps due to more meetings about an upcoming role.</p>
<p>Continuing with Ms. Sexton, she says that on the night of Amber’s 30th birthday party, she was told that Johnny was upstairs, refusing to come down, going so far as to say that Amber and Whitney said they went upstairs to try and get him to come down. Remember, that’s the night that Johnny was late to the party because of a business meeting. He wasn’t upstairs at all. <br>Ms. Sexton is supposed to be Heard’s witness, and does support some aspects of Heard’s story. But, by being honest about things like makeup-gate, she does a fine job of impugning the integrity of Heard’s testimony. <br>The video discussed earlier is finally shown. In it, a woman is talking to Whitney and examining several injuries, saying: “I can’t believe Amber beat you up.”  <br>Yep. That’s BOOM. Proof that Whitney had knowledge of Amber being violent, and being a victim of that violence herself. Busted. <br>Ms. Wass complains that this evidence, which was submitted only last night, is “an ambush” and asks for it to be excluded. But the judge allows the video. <br>Whitney is recalled to the stand. She insists that there was no physical fight between the sisters. It was just the producers trying to make the show more interesting. There are no bruises, she says. The lawyers are looking for injuries that aren’t there. Even though they’re clearly visible. She is so busted it hurts.</p>
<p>After lunch, Whitney was back in the hot seat, spewing out the same story that Johnny was violent when he wasn’t sober. And with that, she was done.</p>
<p>The next witness was Raquel (Rocky) Pennington, who confirmed that she lived rent-free in one of Johnny’s penthouses for roughly two years. Can you imagine? Living RENT FREE in an LA penthouse? And then turning around and betraying the guy that paid for it? I can’t. <br>Rocky did confirm that she’s never seen Johnny beat Amber, but insisted that she saw “deep” gashes on Amber’s arms after Australia and believed Ambers explanation that Johnny did it. She also said that she personally saw all those cuts on Amber’s feet. Ms. Wass suggested that this was a lie, because no cuts existed, but Rocky insists that such was not the case. She says she’s not lying for her friend Amber. <br>Except for insisting that she saw Amber’s cut feet, Rocky’s testimony seems to be toeing the line, saying that all the accounts of Johnny being violent are hearsay, what Amber told her. Not from anything that she witnessed. That actually goes to Johnny’s favor. In fact, throughout her testimony, Rocky seemed a bit wishy-washy, supporting Amber, but leaving a lot of grey area for interpretation. For example, Rocky says that she was best friends with Amber in 2014-2016, but that they aren’t best friends anymore. Just that they “remain close.” That could mean a whole lot, either way. Maybe she was trying to distance herself from Amber so it wouldn’t look like she’d lie for her, or maybe there’s a little bit of trouble in paradise. Like I said, it’s open to interpretation. <br>In the end, Rocky ended up backing Amber, confirming injuries that never happened, like the broken nose and bloody lip Amber says she had before the James Cordon show. When shown photos from the show, Rocky admits that there aren’t any visible injuries, but that her “eyes aren’t that good.” <br>Pitiful. <br>Rocky did trip Amber up a little bit, though, by testifying that Amber was so intoxicated at Coachella that she vomited. Amber earlier testified that she did not vomit at the festival. Woops.</p>
<p>And, like Ms. Sexton, Rocky didn’t know that Amber was in contact with Johnny trying to get him back. So it looks like Amber was doing some shady things behind her buddies’ backs, while getting them to set the stage for her to frame up Johnny. <br>Rocky contradicted herself when Ms. Wass redirected. She backpedaled about Coachella, saying that she did not see Amber Vomit. Too little too late. The damage is done.</p>
<p>Up next, iO Tillet-wright. We’ll find out what he did or didn’t know, whether he backs Heard blindly, or if he’s the first to cut and run. <br>Ms Laws, lawyer for Johnny Depp, will be the first to question iO. First up, iO was asked about outing Lily-Rose Depp and using her photo in his project at the time, even though she was only 16 at the time. iO confirms that Johnny wasn’t happy about it. They had a falling out over it and weren’t speaking at the time. But just like everybody else, iO never saw Johnny being violent toward Amber. He only knows what Amber Heard told him. <br>Ms Laws asked about iO slapping Rocky, but the judge put a stop to that. Pity.<br>Ms. Laws ends her questioning after establishing that iO and Rocky competed for Amber’s attention. iO called that an over-simplification, but didn’t dispute it.</p>
<p>Ms Wass began by asking iO about poopgate, and iO said that Amber couldn’t possibly be responsible for it because she’s poop-phobic and pretends that she doesn’t even poop in private, let alone in somebody’s bed. <br>Wait. Pretends she doesn’t poop? Sure, because that’s SO normal. <br>iO’s account of the Phone-throwing fight is pretty useless, as he was in New York at the time and only heard what Amber wanted him to hear over the phone. All he could really testify to is that he called 911.  It’s interesting that iO said the following: “A number of people who worked in the entertainment industry were afraid of speaking up and saying what they had seen as they feared they would be blacklisted."" Because I firmly believe this to be true, except that I don’t think it’s Johnny they were afraid of. Amber has reportedly left a swath of damage in her path of people afraid to speak up against her for fear of blackmail or other retaliation. So I do believe iO snuck the truth in there at the end. Just not overtly.<br>That’s the end of iO’s testimony, and that’s the end of testimony in this case. On Monday, the Sun will submit their closing statement. On Tuesday, Team Johnny will give their closing statement.</p>
<p>Amber’s team are undoubtedly claiming victory after her buddies testified, but I still think that the case is leaning heavily in Johnny’s favor. I don’t think anything said today really helped Amber at all. If anything, it shot her in the food. That’s my humble opinion, anyway.

166,StarterPetitionUpdate,27361763,2020-07-23T14:34:59.000Z,,"Amber's last day, sister Whitney's first","<p>Sasha Wass is opening questioning, telling Amber Heard we will be starting off with 'the painting incident' which took place in March 2013. We will also be looking at Heard's sixth witness statement, given on 6 July 2020.<br>Amber is wearing black this morning, and her hair is braided at the root, but wavy and loose around her shoulders. She is sipping from a water bottle as she flicks through a large black file of evidence, which in court is referred to as the ""trial bundle.”</p>
<p>We will be hearing about the painting incident which is alleged to have taken place at one of Depp's many homes, in Sweetzer Avenue which is in West Hollywood.</p>
<p>Heard explains to the judge that Depp owns several houses at the end of this road. <br>The painting incident was initially said to have occurred on 8 March 2013, after which there was some filming with Rolling Stone Keith Richards. However, in Heard's sixth statement, Heard wrote:  ""I have now realized I cannot be sure that the painting incident took place on 8 March 2013.” Heard tells the court she now believes the painting incident actually occurred on 22 March 2013. Heard says there were around three times there was filming with Keith Richards over that month. <br>Depp's lawyer Eleanor Laws QC interrupts at this point, saying this is a very important part of the evidence, and she requests permission from the judge to ask Heard questions about it too. <br>Depp is yet to arrive in court this morning. His lawyer has told us this is because he's in a ""film meeting,” so will be a little late. We are expecting him around midday. This means it's possible he may miss Heard's last morning giving evidence. Depp has been later in court a few times this week, which was also said to be due to ""film meetings.”</p>
<p>We are now looking at a text exchange between Heard and Depp's assistant Nathan Holmes on 22 March 2013. It begins around noon with Holmes writing: ""On my way to get him.” To which Heard replies: ""Trying to wake him now.” <br>Holmes replies: ""OK. Thank you.” <br>We then fast forward around six hours, and Heard says she has had ""success"" and has got Depp up. <br>Ms. Wass asks what was happening in those six hours. <br>Heard says he was ""snorting cocaine and drinking whisky.” She says they were talking about the relationship and Depp was jealous, believing she was having affairs with several people including her ex-wife, artist Tasya van Ree. <br>Heard says Depp wouldn't leave the subject alone. Heard describes Depp as being on ""a bender"" at this stage. She says she reached out to friends and her mother at the time. <br>There is another text exchange between Mr. Holmes and Heard in which Heard asks: ""Is he alright? Still upright?” <br>Mr. Holmes answers: ""Yes, OK. He's still upright."" <br>Heard says she asked this as Depp had been taking cocaine and drinking for around 36 hours, and at that point she wasn't used to ""his patterns,” so was worried about his health. She says she wanted to check he was ""still alive.”</p>
<p>We look at a text exchange between Heard and her mother Paige Parsons who died in May of this year. Heard's text to her mum says: ""Dealing with Johnny's spiral. It's terrible mom. I don't know what to do"" and goes on to say ""He's nuts mom. Violent and crazy. I am heartbroken that THIS is who I love.” Her mother says she should tell her father, David. <br>But Heard texts back to say ""I can't tell Dad.” Heard says she trusted her mother, but didn't know whether her ""dad would react violently.” Heard clarifies she means violently towards Depp. <br>A later text to her mother says: ""My heart is broken. I'm OK physically. JD didn't hit me or anything last night. I told him that would be it if he did and it worked last night. But I'm scared by what I see and who I see now. It's Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde -- on a binge. He's not violent to me"" (talking about Depp). <br>Heard tells Ms. Wass she sent this text to her mother as she had sent pictures of her of her bruises pictures to her mother, but didn't want her father to react badly. <br>Heard also sent another text in which she says there was no physical abuse, writing: ""It's OK Mom. He's not being violent with me. He's just even raging in general. And the crazy mood swings and binges are really difficult for me to handle."" She tells Ms. Wass she knew about that first hand as: ""My father was like this to my mother growing up.” Heard sounds emotional as she explains to Ms. Wass what she meant by a text she sent to her mother saying: ""I feel like I'm on a very fast train that's about to explode but I don't want to jump off and leave my love behind . So I stay on the train, even though I know it's about to explode.""<br>She goes on to describe what she says are two distinct parts to Depp's personality. She says when he was sober, he was: ""Generous, loving, a remarkable man when he's like that... The other side of him is a monster. I always held out hope he would get clean and sober.” <br>Heard again clarifies that in texts where she told her mother Depp didn't hit her, she was simply trying to stop her father from finding out about the alleged domestic violence. <br>Heard describes her father David to the court, saying: ""He's an addict and an alcoholic, and very violent, but I loved him very much.” <br>In a text to her mother, referring to Depp, Heard says: ""He makes dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon.” <br>Heard says over this period Depp had stayed at her house for weeks. She says: ""I couldn't get a moments sleep, I was either defending myself or trying to keep him happy... I don't know how it got so violent so fast."" <br>Heard says at one point, she was so exhausted she ""accidentally on purpose"" locked the dead-bolts to keep Depp out of her house, and says she had the best night's sleep she'd had in ages. She texted her mother to say she'd done this. <br>Heard's mother replies: ""Oh my baby, has he stayed this way since then?.” Her mum then asks what Depp's bodyguards are doing about it all.</p>
<p>We are now talking about Heard's sister Whitney Henriquez. In Whitney's first statement, she says Heard told her Depp had ""defaced"" Tasya van Ree's painting, altering the signature to make it read ""Tasya van Pee.” Ms. Laws is saying this is a ""detail to add into their [Heard and Whitney's] constructed account,” and that Depp's act was actually a ""lighthearted joke"" between all-three, then used as evidence in a bid to show Depp in a bad light.<br>There is now some faff in court as everyone searches for a picture. Possibly of some flamingos. No one seeMs. quite sure. <br>Okay, there is a painting of some flamingos, but it's not the one we're talking about. <br>The court is looking at a picture, which is said to include some bags and squares (unfortunately I can't see it to be more specific), and which Heard says was damaged by Depp. Heard says after it was damaged, it was put in the garage. <br>Ms. Laws says talking about this painting has reminded her that ""Mr. Depp was not asked about this painting at all.” She is not very happy about this, and says this topic has come up after Depp's stint in the witness box. Earlier this week Heard said Depp had damaged many paintings during their relationship, hence this slight confusion over exactly which art-work we're talking about.<br>Ms. Wass asks: ""Are any of these paintings the one that Mr. Depp asked you to remove from your bedroom.” <br>Heard answers: ""Yes, it's the one there, that's now sitting in my garage.” <br>The judge is asking for clarification as to which painting she means. <br>""It's the one with flamingos, and it's always been that one,” Heard answers. <br>Ms. Wass asks ""What damage, if any, was there to the painting?"" However, before Heard can answer there is some debate between Ms. Laws and Ms. Wass over whether this question is leading the witness. <br>The judge eventually rules Heard can answer. <br>Heard says: ""This is the painting he tried to burn. He tried to burn it when I objected to taking it down.” Heard says the picture is damaged on the back from this attempted burning.</p>
<p>Now we are moving on to the ""three-day hostage situation"" which is alleged to have taken place in March 2015. First, Ms. Wass asks Heard if she knew about texts between Depp and his assistant Mr. Holmes, dubbed the ""drug texts.” These got Depp into hot water ahead of the trial, when the judge found he was in breach of court for not disclosing the texts to The Sun's lawyers. <br>Heard says she had not been previously aware of these texts.<br>We are looking at texts describing the alleged damage to the house the couple were renting in Australia at the time of the alleged incident. Alleged damage includes broken glass, graffiti on mirrors and broken surfaces. <br>Ms. Wass asks Heard if she was responsible for any of the damage. <br>Heard replies: ""I broke a bottle, that is all.”<br>We now hear a quote from Depp's late head of security, Jerry Judge, in which he says an artwork in the house had been defaced and a penis had been drawn on to a painting of a woman. <br>Ms. Wass reads out the extract from Mr. Judge's statement: ""There are two pictures here standing, very sexy. One in a bikini, standing with her hands on her breasts. What he did was paint a fake d*ck on her p****.” <br>Ms. Laws is objecting to this questioning, not just because it is rather ripe, but because she says the witness is being asked to describe not just what she saw, but also what others saw. <br>Ms. Wass says it shows the ""global destruction"" going on and the ""derangement of Mr. Depp's mind"" at the time, which she says Heard is being made out to have fabricated. <br>Ms. Wass re-frames the question, and we continue.</p>
<p>Heard now describes the scene she says she was met with on entering the house: ""There was mashed potato and gravy smeared on the door outside. <br>""There was  bird in the house. It scared me to death when entered room. It must have flown in window. There was blood everywhere. I thought it was from my feet but it wasn't. I thought it was paint, a kind of brownish color, on the walls. It was dark brown at first, then lightened out to a milky brown colour."" She says the writing which was ""all the way down the stairs and stairwell"" was letters, and she could make out some words written in English. She says there was ""blood on the walls, on lampshades and everywhere with written messages.” <br>She continues: ""He had burned though cushions and lampshades... There was a couch flipped over. It appeared he had set fire to one of the cushions because the couch was burned around it."" <br>Upstairs in the bedroom level Heard says: ""There was a broken window... My paints were out, it appears to be he had either thrown or dropped paint on the floor and on the wall. There was both paint and blood, I could see textures. <br>""I found raw meat, at first I didn't know what it was on the floor. I continued to find it for the next day hidden in various places. <br>""He had taken my nightgown and wrapped it around pieces of food. It was food I had got food out the night before, but not got round to  making it. <br>""I could see my own bloody footprints, and what appeared to be dripping blood. ""I made it downstairs and there was death metal blasting out. There was blood and glass everywhere, and the tiles floor was still wet. There were windows broken. There was so much glass I could barely find a path to walk. The ping pong table was broken and on the ground.""<br>Ms. Wass asks if Heard threw a bottle and damaged Depp's finger. Heard says no. She says: ""It occurred about 24-hours into his binge, his rage.” She says it was after ""he held me up against the fridge and said over and over again that he wished he had never met me and I'd ruined his life. he said I made him drink and I always did this."" She goes on: ""He held a bottle up to my face and said he'd cut me. At some point I pushed him, and tried to push his arMs. away."" <br>Heard tells the court Depp damaged his finger when he repeatedly punched the wall with a cream Bakelite phone, which she says smashed into many pieces. She says at the time she didn't realise that was when he cut his finger, but that is when she believes it happened. Heard describes Depp as being ""out of his mind"" at the time of the alleged incident.</p>
<p>The court took a short break.<br>Ms. Wass has been reminded by the judge that she must finish her questioning by lunch time, as Heard's sister Whitney is due to enter the witness box this afternoon.</p>
<p>Heard is standing in the witness box waiting to resume giving evidence. She has three bottles of water next to her and is putting some sanitizing gel on her hands.</p>
<p>We are talking about an alleged domestic violence incident, when Heard says Depp pulled her by the hair and punched her in the face in March 2015. <br>At this time Heard's sister, Whitney, was also said to be there at the time. This was referred to in court yesterday as the ""staircase incident.” <br>Depp was wearing a hard plaster cast on his hand at the time, following the incident in Australia. Heard later returned to Australia with Depp the following month, and to the same house, after the March 2015 incident. <br>Ms. Heard begins to answer: ""I lived in many houses, and I was assaulted many times."" <br>Ms. Wass asks why she returned to the house in Australia. <br>Heard answers: ""I was used to that.”</p>
<p>We now look at a text from the late Jerry Judge on 26 April 2015. <br>This was five days after Heard and Depp's return to Australia (with their dogs Pistol and Boo).<br>""Hi boss... It's lovely to see how you and Amber are so happy. Seeing you sitting on that bench together yesterday... You two need happiness.” Heard says Depp wasn't drinking or taking drugs at the time.<br>We are talking about the couple's return to Australia to complete Depp's filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean. This was the occasion when the dogs were illegally ""smuggled"" into the country, creating a bio hazard threat. <br>However, at this point it seeMs. the judge has heard enough about the dogs, and says he has already listened to plenty of evidence on this.</p>
<p>We move on to more specific questioning about the forMs. that were filled out ahead of the dogs entering the country. At the time, Heard pleaded guilty to illegally bringing them into the country, despite saying she was not responsible for filling out the forMs. and had believed the dogs had had the correct shots to travel.</p>
<p>We will now see a transcript of a recording, which Ms. Wass says was captured on 26 September 2015. The couple had a practice of recording arguments early on in their relationship, in an attempt to learn from them and come to a constructive conclusion. Later in the relationship covert recordings of arguments were also captured. Both types of recording are being heard as evidence in the case. The recording took place after the couple's honeymoon trip to South East Asia, which was in July 2015. In the conversation, Depp talks about their honeymoon, saying it was good apart from one argument in San Francisco. <br>He also talks about their arguments and says: ""There can be no physical violence towards each other.” He says when they fall out, they need to physically separate from each other in order to cool off and avoid conflict. He goes on to say otherwise we will ""f***ing kill each other, or worse you know, f***ing break up.” <br>Depp's lawyer, Ms. Laws, is again saying there is an issue here - that these questions have not been put to Depp so ""there is no evidential basis"" for the questions to Heard. The judge upholds this, and we move on.</p>
<p>We return to the days leading up to Heard's appearance on the James Corden Late Late show on 16 December 2015. <br>Ms. Wass is reminding us Heard has been accused of making the injuries up, and also of photo shopping images. <br>Heard says she did not. She also says she put no make-up on to make injuries appear worse, adding ""I put make up on only to try to hide them [the injuries].” <br>There were also images of a broken bed in penthouse 4 supplied. Heard says yes, and she did not damage the bed. <br>Images of clumps of hair were also pictured on the floor. <br>Head says she did not pull out her own hair, and nor did she ask anyone else to pull out her hair. <br>During the fight on 12 December, Heard also alleges that Depp headbutted her. <br>We are talking about a recording of an argument between Depp and Heard that was taken around July 2016, which mentions a headbutt. In it you can hear Depp saying: ""I headbutted you... in the forehead. That doesn't break a nose.” <br>Ms. Wass asks Heard at what point she realised there was a recording in which Depp mentioned a headbutt, but the judge tells her to move on.</p>
<p>We move on to a visit from nurse, Erin Boerum to Heard on 17 December 2015.</p>
<p>Heard says: ""She was just dropping off meds, and she was late.”</p>
<p>We move on to Heard and Depp travelling to the Bahamas with his children in 2014. However, now again, Ms. Laws interrupts and we move on.</p>
<p>We watch a video, showing the inside of the house in the Bahamas. The person filming the video is walking towards a beaded curtain on a doorway, and the bathroom is apparently through the curtain and to the left. <br>Heard has alleged she was abused inside the closet, and from the inside of the bathroom, inside the door. <br>The video goes on to show the closet, and a bed, and pan around the room. We can hear no more on this subject, as we are now veering towards parts of the hearing that need to be held in private. <br>Parts of Heard's evidence, relating to allegations of sexual violence, have been heard in private, with the media excluded from the proceedings.</p>
<p>We move on to just after Heard's 30th birthday, and a photo that was taken on 23 April 2016. Heard says it was taken at the Coachella Festival. Heard names her friends in the picture left to right: Romi Serafy, herself, Whitney, Melanie Inglessis, iO Tillet Wright, and Savannah McMillan. <br>She nearly forgets her final friend's name, and laughs as she stumbles to find the name. <br>Ms. Wass puts it to Heard that she has been accused of ""painting on injuries"" that can be seen in photos now being shown to the court. This was alleged to be from photos taken during the last big alleged argument between Depp and Heard on 21 May 2016. The photo metadata shows it was taken at 8.23pm before the police arrived later that evening. <br>Heard says she neither put on make up to enhance nor create the appearance of injures, and says she also didn't want to talk to the police. <br>Ms. Wass says it was also suggested to Heard that her and her friends - including neighbor Rocky Pennington - trashed the penthouse and said it was Depp who had done it in order to frame him. <br>Heard says no, this is not the case.</p>
<p>We are now watching CCTV video taken in the LA penthouse apartment block, taken on 22 May 2016. It shows Heard entering the lift, while texting on her phone. She then gets out of the lift. <br>Heard returns to the lift a few minutes later holding packages. Heard says she then went to her car. She says her first engagement that day was going to her friend Rocky's beach house.<br>We are looking at a photo taken at 13.58 on the same day. The picture shows Heard on the left of the photo, and Ms. Wass asks her if she was wearing make-up on that occasion. <br>""Yes, I was [wearing make-up]. Absolutely.” <br>Ms. Wass asks: ""Do you ever go out of the house without make-up.” <br>Heard laughs, and says: ""No, I live in LA.” <br>The judge asks for clarification on why this is.<br>Heard answers: ""I'm recognizable, or a celebrity or whatever you want to call it. So I never go out of the house without make up in case I'm photographed.”<br>After going to the beach house, Heard says ""I went to my friend Amanda's birthday party.” She clarifies that this is the British presenter Amanda de Cadenet.<br>Ms. Wass reads out a text from de Cadenet which advises Heard to ""put arnica on it.” <br>Heard explains that arnica is a homeopathic remedy which is said to alleviate bruises and swelling. <br>The judge isn't keen for us to dwell on this topic, so we move on.</p>
<p>We move on to details around 21 April and 21 May incidents (around Heard's birthday and the alleged final argument in LA, when a phone was said to have been thrown by Depp at Heard). <br>We are discussing Heard meeting with Depp near the end of their relationship.<br>Heard says the understanding was that Depp's security and others would always be ""in shouting distance"" of the couple. Heard says she didn't trust Depp's staff to step in and help her, so she always wanted others to be nearby too. <br>Ms. Wass is keen to know exactly how Heard felt about meeting with Depp, but the judge says no, this is a leading question.<br>We talk about the details of the domestic abuse becoming public knowledge.<br>Heard says ""I didn't want to talk about everything that happened in our marriage or relationship. I didn't want the world or his kids to know who he was, and what he could do.""<br>Earlier this week Heard told Depp's lawyer: ""I was trying to save him the embarrassment and this, quite frankly.”<br>Heard now clarifies, and says she was talking about the current court case when she said ""and this,” adding ""I meant no offence to these proceedings.”<br>Ms. Wass asks if her career has benefited from the case.<br>Heard answers: ""What women has ever benefited from being the victim of domestic violence?""<br>Ms. Wass asks if she has benefited financially.<br>Heard says: ""No. I entered into he marriage without a  pre or post-nuptial agreement in a no-fault state. I was entitled to 50% ."" <br>Ms. Wass's final question is: ""Have you told the truth to this court?"" <br>Heard answers: ""Absolutely.”</p>
<p>And with that, Heard has finished giving evidence. She steps down from the witness box. <br>The judge reminds her not to talk to any other witnesses during the case. <br>Heard's sister, Whitney, is due to enter the witness box this afternoon.</p>
<p>I’m not going to give a blow-by-blow accounting of Whitney’s testimony like I did with Amber’s. I think it’s safe to say that she’ll back her sister up on everything. It would be a real shocker if she didn’t.</p>
<p>I’m actually going to call it here. I’ll post the link to the transcript when it becomes available, but quite honestly, I can’t sit here and listen to this nonsense. Whitney’s lying her ass off for her sister, in even more ridiculous ways than I thought she would. Claiming that all the drugs were hers, for example.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just in a mood today, but it triggers me that a mother would rather spend more than a month (two?) taking part in this fiasco rather than being home with her baby son.</p>
<p>So, I’m off for the day.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.</p>","{'id': '224329221', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/ye/bt/OwYEBTqoipYxMhz-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595514902', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
167,StarterPetitionUpdate,27352842,2020-07-22T15:45:02.000Z,,"Amber Heard on the stand, take 3","<p>Amber Heard showed up for court wearing a tan blouse and rather tattered looking black sweater jacket, with her hair still up in her Heidi braid on top of her head.</p>
<p>Eleanor Laws QC, representing Johnny Depp, is asking Heard about what happened in Australia in March 2015 - an incident the actress has previously described as a ""three-day hostage situation.” <br>Ms.. Laws is asking if Depp was trying to get away from Heard. <br>The actress disagrees. <br>The QC asks if Heard was in a rage - again, she disagrees. <br>Heard is now being asked if she threw a bottle at Depp - again, she disagrees. <br>Ms.. Laws puts it to her that she would throw things at Depp during fights, to which Heard replies. ""I only threw things to escape Johnny when he was beating me up. Sometimes that's all I had.""<br>Ms.. Laws is saying Heard threw a bottle ""forcefully"" at Depp in Australia. <br>Heard says no, that it was Depp who was throwing bottles. <br>Heard says at one point, Depp offered her a bottle. She says she reached to take it and the actor pulled it back, that he was ""taunting me to take it.” <br>She continues: ""He did it again.""</p>
<p>Heard says she was thinking about previous occasions when Depp had told her she had ""saved his life"" by helping him stop drinking. She says at that point she smashed the bottle on the floor. <br>She says she regrets doing this.</p>
<p>Depp then started throwing bottles ""one after the other, right in my direction"", she says. ""I felt glass breaking behind me. I retreated more... he didn't stop. ""I was too scared to look behind me."" <br>The judge asks her to clarify if Depp threw several bottles. The actress says he threw all the bottles there apart from one. <br>""When he was clean and sober he would tell me I saved his life,"" Heard is telling the court. ""When he was clean and sober he was wonderful, that part of him I loved so much."" Everyone around him wanted him ""to be well"" and for him to ""get help"", she says.</p>
<p>Heard is being asked to look at a file now, containing a photograph. <br>The actress says: ""I would be shocked if Johnny remembers any of this hiMs..elf. "" <br>Ms.. Laws interrupts, saying she wants to know about an injury to Depp - we have heard a lot already about how he wounded his finger in Australia. <br>The question Ms.. Laws wants an answer to is that it was ""inconceivable"" that Depp injured hiMs..elf smashing a phone against a wall, the judge tells Heard. <br>The actress disagrees. <br>Depp has accused Heard of throwing a bottle at him, causing the injury. She denies this. <br>She is now being asked about a cigarette burn on Depp's cheek, shown in a photograph. ""Johnny did that,"" Heard says. ""He often did things like that."" <br>Heard denies that it was she who was being violent. <br>Heard is now being asked if it is true that at one stage she was screaming at Depp not to leave and then calling him a ""coward.” <br>She says this is not true.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws is now asking about Heard's evidence yesterday, moving on from the Australia incident. <br>The court is being played some audio. We can hear a woman's voice but it's pretty quiet (remember, we are in a different courtroom to where the trial is taking place, watching on screen). <br>Now a man's voice. Ms.. Laws says this is a conversation between Heard and Depp.<br>""Sometimes I lose my cool when I get angry,"" Heard says in court, when asked by Ms.. Laws.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws is now moving on to a different Australia incident, when Heard and Depp infamously took their dogs, Yorkshire Terriers Pistol and Boo, into the country. <br>""It was made quite clear to you... that you couldn't take the dogs into Australia,"" Ms.. Laws is saying to Heard. The actress says she received mixed messages. <br>The court has previously heard evidence from Kevin Murphy, who worked for Depp for almost eight years - he alleged Heard ""demanded"" he make a false statement about the animals being ""smuggled"" into the country. <br>He also claimed Ms.. Heard asked him to contact her former assistant, Kate James, and ask her to ""lie under oath"" to an Australian court about the incident. <br>Mr. Murphy said the actress was ""repeatedly"" told it would be illegal for her to take her two dogs with her to the country. <br>In October 2015, Heard faced criminal proceedings in Australia over the incident. In 2016 she and Depp recorded a now infamous video in 2016 apologizing for doing so.<br>Ms.. Laws is now reading out an email from Mr. Murphy, in which it seeMs.. he is making it clear that the dogs would not be able to travel at the time they wanted to go due to restrictions. <br>Heard says the process went on for a while and was confusing. <br>Speaking about Depp, she says she was travelling on ""his plane"" for ""his movie"" and she thought it had been ""taken care of.” <br>Ms.. Laws said it was laid out in ""black and white"" and that Heard took the decision. <br>""Johnny's the boss,"" Heard says. She says he called the shots. <br>""You got caught,"" Ms.. Laws says. Heard says they both flew in, yet she was the one who got into trouble. She said anything against Depp would have ""compromised Pirates [of the Caribbean]"", which the actor was filming in the country. <br>Heard tells the court: ""I took the blame.""</p>
<p>The judge wants to ask Heard about the charge she faced. Was it for bringing a dog into Australia although she had said ""in some form or other"" that she wasn't bringing a dog into the country? <br>Heard says both she and Depp filled out forMs.. but that because filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean had already been compromised by the earlier incident in Australia (when Depp wounded his finger), she took the blame. <br>Ms.. Laws tells Heard knew she was taking the dogs in without the proper paperwork. <br>Heard says no, she thought they did have the correct paperwork. <br>Ms.. Laws is suggesting that Heard was trying to find someone to take the blame for her. <br>She says no and that she had already pleaded guilty. <br>Ms.. Laws is saying that Heard wanted her former assistant Kate James to lie in a statement about the dogs. <br>Heard says this is incorrect. The actress says she only wanted to show that they had tried to follow protocol.</p>
<p>There is a lot of back and forth about the dogs now. Heard is taking a sip from her water bottle. <br>""Trying to get around official rules is something you've done before,"" Ms.. Laws says. Heard says she doesn't know what the QC means. <br>She says Depp thought things were ""easy"" to take care of in ""his world.” <br>She says she was not in a relationship in which she had ""a lot of choice.” <br>Ms.. Laws puts it to Heard that she blames Depp for things she is accused of. She says this is not the case.</p>
<p>We are now moving on to a different alleged incident, during the couple's honeymoon in July 2015 on a train in southeast Asia. <br>Heard is being shown a photograph in which Depp is apparently injured (we cannot see the photographs they are shown in court). <br>Ms.. Laws says Heard has turned the incident around. The actress denies this. ""He strangled me,"" she tells the court.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws is now directing Heard to her own account of what took place in a different alleged incident - we have moved on quickly - during which she claiMs.. Depp headbutted her at their penthouse apartment in LA. <br>The QC is reading out the actress's allegations, in which she claiMs.. he punched her and dragged her. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is a ""complete set of lies""; Heard quietly says no. <br>The actress asks for a break ""whenever is convenient.” <br>Ms.. Laws says she wants to finish her point and then we can have a break. <br>Ms.. Laws is talking about nurse Erin Boerum's account of the incident. <br>""You didn't have any bruising at all when you saw Erin Boerum, did you?"" Ms.. Laws says. <br>Heard says she had two black eyes, a broken nose, a ""broken lip"", bruised ribs, ""bruises all over my body.” <br>She says the ""really bad [bruises]"" were on her scalp. There were chunks of hair missing, she says, and it sounds like she is getting upset. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is ""nonsense.” Heard disagrees. <br>The QC asks if she bit her own lip. ""Of course not,"" Heard replies.</p>
<p>After a 10 minute break, Amber Heard gets back in the witness box. She is being directed to a new file by Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp. <br>Heard is looking at a photo of her alleged injuries and is being asked if she ""played around"" with the images. <br>""I don't know how to,"" Heard replies.<br>This is from December 2015; the next day the actress recorded for James Corden's show. <br>Ms.. Laws is being asked if this is what she looked like on the show - as in, did she look like she does in the photo.<br>Heard says she had her hair and make-up done at home. <br>Ms.. Laws has asked about stylist Samantha McMillen, who saw Heard on that day.<br>Heard says Ms.. McMillen saw her while her make-up was being done. <br>Ms.. McMillen is Depp's stylist, Heard says, but also worked as her stylist while they were a couple. She says it is not true that Ms.. McMillen saw her without make-up on. <br>Ms.. McMillen, who has already given evidence in court, says she saw ""no visible"" injuries the day after Heard claiMs.. Depp was violent. <br>The stylist says she spent ""much of the afternoon and early evening"" with Heard on 16 December 2015, as the star prepared to appear on James Corden's The Late Late Show, and she could ""see clearly"" that Heard had no marks, cuts or bruises. <br>Heard is being asked to look at a picture of Depp and says she can see no mark. <br>She denies injuring him, saying: ""I don't know how I could have."" <br>Heard is now being directed to another photograph, which Ms.. Laws says is of hair Heard alleges was pulled out. <br>Ms.. Laws is suggesting this has been set up, that her hair would have come out at the root. <br>Heard is asked why she took a photo of her scalp if her hair did not break at the root. The actress says her scalp was bleeding. <br>She says this photograph shows just one of many clumps of hair that were pulled out.</p>
<p>We are now being shown a short clip of Heard on Corden's show. <br>The actress confirMs.. it is her. <br>She has bright red lipstick on and is wearing a cream blouse and black tie. <br>""That's what you looked like on the show,"" Ms.. Laws says, and says there is no injury. Heard says she had ""tons of injuries.” <br>Ms.. Laws is now talking about a still taken from footage from the show. She says the actress does not have a split lip. <br>The actress says the reason she wore the red lipstick and make-up is to ""cover"" injuries.</p>
<p>We are now going back to Heard's first allegation of violence against Depp, in early 2013. <br>The couple had moved in together the previous year.<br>In her witness statement, Heard says: ""We were talking about one of his tattoos, which he had had altered from Winona (his ex-partner) to say 'Wino'. I laughed at something he said but he must not have meant it as a joke and he hit me with an open hand across my cheek."" <br>Later in her statement, she says: ""It felt like my eye popped out.""<br>Ms.. Laws asks if Heard is making this up. Heard says she does not agree.</p>
<p><br>Ms.. Laws has moved on again, to an alleged incident in the Bahamas in August 2014. The QC reads from Heard's statement again, in which the actress alleges that Depp grabbed her hair and slapped her. <br>""He was in such a rage that he smashed a door so hard that it splintered,"" she says in her statement.<br>Ms.. Laws is directing Heard to a photograph, and says ""this is not a door from the Bahamas, is it?"" <br>Heard admits it is not but that it was a different door he kicked. <br>Ms.. Laws says Amber has submitted evidence in a ""cavalier"" way. Heard says it was an error. <br>We are now watching a very short clip, with no sound, of the inside of the property in the Bahamas. Heard confirMs.. that it is.</p>
<p>Moving on again, to a trip to Tokyo in January 2015, the month before the couple got married. <br>Heard tells the court she attended a premiere there about two days after Depp was allegedly violent. She says she remembers wearing a backless dress to the event ""very well.” She tells the court her injuries were ""not visible.”</p>
<p>And now to Thanksgiving, November 2015 - we're moving between allegations quite speedily now. <br>In Heard's statement, she says: ""We were in our place in LA. Johnny was using a lot of drugs at the time, especially cocaine and weed, which he was pretty much constantly smoking. ""We got into a fight on Thanksgiving, where Johnny ripped my shirt and threw me across the room. He threw a wine glass and a heavy glass decanter at me, which thankfully both missed me. Once when he pushed me, I fell over the back of a lounge chair and hit my head against the apartment’s exposed brick wall. I noticed later that I had got a lump on the back of my head and a busted lip from this."" <br>Ms.. Laws asks if this is all true. ""Yes, it is,"" Heard replies.</p>
<p>Ms.. Laws has directed Heard to a file and the court is going to be shown a video clip. The footage is very dark; the actress says she can barely see it (neither can we) when asked to confirm where the footage was recorded. <br>She says it looks like one of Depp's penthouses in LA but ""cannot tell"" which one. <br>There are a few people in the clip, including a man flicking a scarf - Heard confirMs.. this is her father, David. Jack, Depp's son, is also there, Heard says. “I believe I hear Marilyn Manson's voice,"" Heard says. <br>Ms.. Laws says everyone is ""joking around"" in the video, and it does sound like people are laughing.<br>Heard is being directed to a photograph; Ms.. Laws asks if it was taken after she received a ""split lip.” <br>The actress says the alleged injury happened after the photo was taken, and that fights with Depp happened after other people had ""gone home"" or ""gone to bed.” <br>Ms.. Laws asks about Heard's friend, Raquel 'Rocky' Pennington, who the actress says she cannot identify in the video (as it's so dark) but confirMs.. she was there.<br>Ms.. Laws is reading from Ms.. Pennington's account. <br>Rocky says that at one point Heard went upstairs to find Depp and they were gone for some period. Ms.. Pennington says Heard told her Depp had thrown a bottle of wine at her, the court hears.<br>Ms.. Laws puts it to Heard that this means the fight took place while others were there - contradicting what she has previously said. <br>Heard says this was just the first ""part"" of the argument.<br>The judge is saying he would find it helpful to have a plan of Depp's penthouses to get more of a sense of where alleged incidents took place - the court is hearing about penthouse five and penthouse three. <br>Erin Boerum, a nurse who treated both Ms.. Heard and Johnny Depp during their relationship, was there on the night of the alleged incident. <br>Heard says she was downstairs during ""part"" of the incident but not later on. <br>""It got much worse later,"" Heard tells the court. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is a ""lie."" <br>Heard replies: ""No, Ma'am.""<br>We are waiting to see a video clip, I think it is, but it appears there are some technical difficulties. <br>Ms.. Laws says she is going to move on.</p>
<p>This part of Heard’s testimony is given in private, with the media and public briefly excluded from the proceedings.</p>
<p>On the heels of Heard’s private testimony, the court adjourns for lunch.</p>
<p>Back in court after lunch, there has been some discussion about the trial timetable as Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, has not finished cross-examining Heard. <br>However, the judge has decided we will hear from Joshua Drew, via video-link from LA, first, and he is now giving his affirmation. At the moment, we can hear him but can't see him on the screen in the media room. <br>Mr. Drew is the ex-fiance of Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington, Heard's friend, and he is being asked about the night of 21 April 2016 - Amber Heard's 30th birthday party.</p>
<p>Mr. Drew agrees with Ms. Laws that Depp was ""coherent"" and ""friendly.” He says his perception was that Depp was ""slightly inebriated.” Mr. Drew's perception was that it was a ""fun"" evening, he says. <br>Ms. Laws is asking Mr. Drew if a lot of the information he had about Depp and Heard's relationship came from Ms. Pennington. <br>Mr. Drew says this is correct and confirMs. he never saw the actor hitting Heard. He says he saw rows between them ""on rare occasions.” <br>(We can see Mr. Drew on the screen now, by the way. He has a beard and glasses and is wearing a grey jacket and a blue shirt.<br>Ms. Laws asks Mr. Drew if he ever saw Heard drink to ""excess"" or taking drugs. He says yes to the drinking and that he has seen Heard take drugs, including mushrooMs., on rare occasions. <br>Ms. Laws is directing Mr. Drew to a deposition he has given.<br>Ms. Laws is now moving on to 21 May 2016, the final alleged incident of violence before Depp and Heard's break-up. <br>Ms.. Laws says Mr. Drew and Ms. Pennington got involved in supporting Heard and lying afterwards. <br>He does not agree. <br>Asked if he saw an assault, he says: ""I did not, as I have stated repeatedly."" <br>Asked if Heard had an injury, he says she did. <br>Ms. Laws says she has no further questions.<br>Sasha Wass, representing NGN, wants to clarify on Heard's drug use. <br>Mr. Drew confirMs. he has never seen the actress take cocaine. <br>Ms. Wass is saying to Mr. Drew that it's being suggested that Heard was not injured when he saw her following the alleged incident in LA in May 2016. <br>Ms. Wass is directing him to a photograph of Heard, which he confirMs. he can see. <br>She then directs him to metadata attached to the photograph, but the judge cuts this short. <br>Asked by Ms. Wass, Mr. Drew says he was present when photos were taken and when police arrived at the property. <br>He says he was present when photographs of damage in the property was taken. <br>Mr. Drew is being asked to describe a print-out of a photograph but he says he cannot see it as it's too dark.<br>He is being directed to another, but he says this is just as dark. <br>Ms. Wass asks if photos can be shown on screen instead. This might take a second or two.</p>
<p>This picture shows Amber Heard and Johnny Depp with staff from the Eastern Oriental, the luxury sleeper train they took in Malaysia on their honeymoon in August 2015. <br><a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/5G5tLYWq8v9a0FIkrEdSbw/https/media.fyre.co/vrUoqxFZS2SiKeGQ8m9e_2.54688258.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/5G5tLYWq8v9a0FIkrEdSbw/https/media.fyre.co/vrUoqxFZS2SiKeGQ8m9e_2.54688258.jpg</a> <br>Heard said in her written statement they got into an argument on the train and Depp pushed her up against the wall of their cabin and tore her shirt, exposing her breast as he screamed, hit her face and choked her before he let go.</p>
<p><br>The judge is reminding the court of the time pressures and says there has been a technical difficulty so Ms. Wass is going to continue her questioning. <br>Wass asks Mr. Drew if he can remember what damage there was to the property (we are talking about Depp's LA penthouses - Mr. Drew and Ms. Pennington lived in one at the time). <br>""In the hallway... there was a pretty substantial pool of red wine, there was a dent in the door of the penthouse that Raquel and I occupied,"" he says. This was penthouse one. <br>“In penthouse three there was broken glass"", he says. “In penthouse five there was a variety of things that had been thrown about.” He says there was glass from a broken picture frame on the floor and piles of books that had been ""shoved around.” <br>Ms. Wass asks if Mr. Drew took photographs and he says he believes he did. <br>Did he see how the damage was caused? <br>“No,” he says. He also says he did not cause the damage. <br>Ms. Wass asks what he recalls about his interaction with the police. <br>Mr. Drew says his initial recollection is not completely clear ""after all these years"" but he says he greeted the officers and ""walked them through the damage myself.”<br>The witness says he took them back to penthouse three, where Heard was, and the female officer said she wanted to speak to the actress privately. <br>The witness says he stayed outside with the male officer and asked ""what we could do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Drew has now finished giving evidence and again, there is some legal argument about the time being taken. Ms. Laws isn't happy.</p>
<p>While we are having a short break, back to the couple's honeymoon, which was discussed earlier. <br>This picture shows Amber Heard and Johnny Depp with staff from the Eastern and Oriental Express, the luxury sleeper train they took in Malaysia on their honeymoon in August 2015. <br>Heard said in her written statement they got into an argument on the train and Depp pushed her up against the wall of their cabin and tore her shirt, exposing her breast as he screamed, hit her face and choked her before he let go. She might have gotten away with this testimony except that in photos, her neck is free of injuries, pale and perfect. She debunks herself. Depp, on the other hand, sports injuries that she inflicted upon him, unless she’s willing to say that he does it hiMs.elf.</p>
<p>After a very short break, Melanie Inglessis is being sworn in now via video-link.</p>
<p>In 2015, she was a professional make-up artist, she tells the court.<br>She says she first did Heard's make-up in 2015 and continued to do so for the next few years. She says she has met Johnny Depp and seen him about ""five or six times.” She says interactions with Depp were ""lovely.”<br>Asked if she spoke to Heard about her relationship, she says they had ""many"" conversations ""about her relationship with Johnny.”</p>
<p>Our source has decided to cut out the xe by Ms. Laws and go straight to the redirect by Ms.. Wass. But fear not, the full transcripts will be posted later by the ever-reliable Nick Wallis. You can read the whole thing, then. I know I will.</p>
<p><br>Ms. Inglessis is being asked by Ms. Wass about the restraining order filed by Heard after her break-up with Depp. <br>The witness says it was not out of the blue to her. <br>Ms. Wass asks about 15 December 2015, the day before Heard recorded James Corden's show. ""Can you tell us what you saw of Amber's face on that day?"" <br>Ms. Inglessis says she was supposed to go bowling with Heard and she never showed up. She says Heard sent a text later on saying she had had a fight with Depp; Ms. Inglessis says she went to their penthouse and saw broken glass on the floor and damage to the bed upstairs, as well as writing on the kitchen worktop. <br>Ms. Wass asks about Heard's condition. Ms. Inglessis says she was ""erratic"", ""upset"" and there was ""a lot of emotion.” <br>The witness says Heard told her she and Depp had had a fight and that the actor had tried to suffocate her with a pillow and dragged her by her hair. <br>Ms. Inglessis tells the court she had to do Heard's make-up the following day, for Corden's show. The witness says Heard had ""discoloration"" near her eyes, that her left eye was a little more bruised than the right eye. The bridge of Heard's nose was red and swollen, she says, and Heard had a cut or scab on her lip. <br>Ms. Wass asks what they talked about while Ms. Inglessis was doing Heard's make-up. <br>She says they talked about the incident the night before, that the actress told her how her alleged injuries happened. <br>The witness says she applied a full face of make-up and that although it was not uncommon for Heard to wear full red lipstick, she remembers that the discussion that day was that she had no other choice because she needed to cover an injury on her lip. <br>Ms. Wass asks how effective concealer is; Ms. Inglessis says it is ""very effective"" on bruises and that they were no longer visible once her make-up had been applied. <br>Heard said 15 December 2015 was one of the worst ""one of the worst and most violent nights"" of their relationship, with Depp throwing a decanter at her, slapping her and dragging her by her hair around their penthouse before headbutting her and saying he would kill her. <br>The next day she was due on The Late Show with James Corden, which Joshua Drew, the then partner of her friend Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington, said Heard told them she could not drop out of.</p>
<p>After a few questions from Ms. Laws, Ms. Inglessis says she is not lying about what she saw. She tells the court she did not want to give evidence in the case. <br>The judge has now thanked her and we will be moving back to Heard again shortly.</p>
<p>Heard is now back in the witness box and Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, is questioning her. She wants to move on to a short point about Heard's restraining order against the actor, she says, after their break-up in 2016. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard was ""not limited"" to what she could or couldn't say. <br>Heard says no, she was told by her attorney to ""keep it brief"" and had no personal knowledge of how she should proceed. <br>There was no need for Heard to attend the courthouse for an appearance about it, Ms. Laws says. ""No, I don't think so,"" Heard says. <br>Ms. Laws says this is a lie. <br>Heard says this is not true, that her attorney told her she had to ""show up.”</p>
<p>We are now returning to Thanksgiving 2015, and a video that could not be played earlier. It is a longer clip and we can hear people laughing in it. <br>Ms. Heard confirMs. this was filmed in penthouse five and she can see her friend Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington, herself, Depp, her father, Depp's son Jack and a woman with dark hair. Heard says this looks like a friend of Depp's named Pat. <br>""This is a happy family event, isn't it?"" Ms. Laws says. <br>""Yes, it is,"" Heard replies. However, she says it is ""untrue"" that there was no violence on that night. She says the two things are ""unrelated.” <br>Ms. Laws says the video was timestamped after midnight. Before this, they had had a ""brief altercation"", Heard says, but ""relative to other things it was pretty minor.”<br>The court is being shown once again the other video from Thanksgiving, which we have seen already. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard about ""the other side"" of Depp, ""the monster,"" that she has described previously - is this a lie? <br>Heard says no. <br>The words ""savage"" and ""monster"" can be heard being said by Marilyn Manson in the video - the court previously heard he was there on that evening - which Heard agrees sound like a joke in the clip. <br>Asked if these words were used as a joke between them, Heard says this was ""Johnny and his friends.”</p>
<p>Ms. Laws is now moving on to an alleged incident in the Bahamas in December 2015. <br>She reads from the witness statement of Depp's estate manager, Tara Roberts, who said in her witness statement that Heard was ""repeatedly berating"" the actor ""with increasing ferocity.” Ms. Roberts continued: ""She was insulting him, calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught I heard her say specifically 'your career is over', 'no one is going to hire you', 'you’re washed up', 'fat', “you will die a lonely man'."" <br>Ms. Heard says these words were said, but actually by Depp, not her.<br>Seriously?<br>That is it for Ms. Laws's cross-examination of the actress. <br>Sasha Wass, for NGN, is going to ask Heard some questions now. <br>Ms. Wass is asking about substance abuse. Heard tells the court she has never had treatment for drug or alcohol abuse of any kind.<br>She admits she did throw a can as she was ""running away"" from the actor.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws accused Heard of ""concocting"" her accusations of violence. ""Mr. Depp has never assaulted you, it has always been you that starts the fight and the rows."" <br>The judge asks for those parts to be answered separately. <br>Heard says that it is ""untrue"" that Depp never assaulted her and ""untrue"" that she always instigated fights.</p>
<p>Heard admits she has used cocaine a few times. Asked about alcohol, she says she has never had a problem but chose to stop drinking spirits and most other alcohol when she was 19 due to her background - she has previously said her parents are alcoholics. <br>She says she drinks red wine occasionally.<br>Ms. Wass is asking if Heard has taken cocaine since she was a teenager. <br>""One time I did, many years after the divorce,"" Heard says. The judge says we can move on. <br>Heard says she never took cocaine while she was with Depp and never encouraged him to take the drug either. <br>Ms. Wass asks if Heard has ever self-harmed; the actress says she never has: ""I have never cut myself, ever.""<br>Ms. Wass asks Heard about previous evidence she has given claiming Depp has self-harmed. <br>""His body's full of... scars... I saw him do it to hiMs.elf,"" Heard says.<br>The court is hearing about a mark on Depp's cheek, which Heard says was inflicted by Depp.<br>Ms. Wass asks about Heard's claim that the actor put out a cigarette out on his face. <br>""It was deliberate,"" Heard says. The actress says Depp was saying he didn't feel it as he was already in so much pain. <br>She says Depp had taken cocaine and other drugs at this point.</p>
<p>Ms. Wass is directing Heard to look in a file now (we can see quite a lot of big files behind the actress in the witness box). <br>She wants to ask about the actress's relationship with Tasya van Ree, who she was with when she met Depp. <br>Ms. Wass is reading an email from Ms. van Ree which says that Heard was ""wrongfully accused"" of an incident in 2009, which we have heard about previously. <br>""Was there any truth in the suggestion that you assaulted or beat Ms. van Ree ever?"" Ms. Wass asks. <br>""Absolutely not,"" Heard says, and adds that they had a ""beautiful"" and ""peaceful"" relationship and good friendship after they broke up. <br>The judge says the answer is ""no.” <br>Ms. Wass is asking about Heard's friend and former assistant Savannah McMillan. <br>The actress has previously answered questions on her from Ms. Laws, about her pay and her title. <br>Ms. Wass is asking about times when Heard travelled abroad and Ms. McMilan was with her - did she work for Heard or someone else? <br>Heard gives specific filMs. she worked on and says production companies paid Ms. McMillan. <br>The court has previously heard how Heard send a letter to Homeland Security officials in the US in 2014, about Ms. McMillan, who is British, to indicate that she was not working ""illegally"" in the US. <br>Heard tells the court the letter was composed by Ms. McMillan but she signed it. <br>Heard tells the court that when flying into the US, Ms. McMillan was detained for several hours, which is when she first learned that there might be a problem.</p>
<p>That’s it for today. There will be a full transcript up a bit later, and I’ll edit this update to include it, if I can. I can’t say that I look forward to reading all of this again with the omitted parts in place, but I’ll do it. Johnny deserves that justice.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that I’m blown away by Heard’s allegation that Johnny did all that crap to himself in Australia. Cut his own finger off? Burned his own face with a cigarette? It boggles the mind, on top of all the other spinning, manipulation and outright lying that took place today.</p>
<p>More tomorrow!</p>","{'id': '224322954', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/7/zj/bg/AzZJbGjYpawhUOo-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595432706', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
168,StarterPetitionUpdate,27343904,2020-07-21T15:54:06.000Z,,"Amber in the hot seat, day 2","<p>Amber showed up wearing a cream colored blouse and fawn colored jacket, with her hair braided up over her head. She is again being questioned by Eleanor Laws QC, representing Johnny Depp. <br>Johnny arrived late. <a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/hn63AieJXM7Zwke917XeNQ/https/media.fyre.co/orwZ625MS.kyRa7CgPe4Q_2020-07-21T092751Z_1701038136_RC2LXH9J38CJ_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-PEOPLE-DEPP.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/hn63AieJXM7Zwke917XeNQ/https/media.fyre.co/orwZ625MS.kyRa7CgPe4Q_2020-07-21T092751Z_1701038136_RC2LXH9J38CJ_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-PEOPLE-DEPP.JPG</a></p>
<p><br>The last time he showed up late, it was because of a meeting he had about a new role, so it’s possible that today’s tardiness is related to that.</p>
<p>They picked up where they left off, about Johnny on a rampage the night Amber claimed that he threw a phone at her face, destroying everything he could, from Penthouse 3 where they lived, to the penthouse where Rocky Pennington (RP) kept her beads. She called him crazed and delusional.</p>
<p>There was a quick chat about what pronoun to use for iO Tillet Wright (iO). Amber explains that iO now prefers the female pronoun “she.”  Heard is shown CCTV footage of herself with concierge Cornelius Harrell in March 2016, and reluctantly admits that it’s her. Mr. Harrell has given statements for court that Amber had no marks on her face. Amber disagrees, naturally. Ms. Laws mentions all the other people who also said she didn’t have any marks on her. Were they all lying?</p>
<p>Next, Heard is asked about a series of tweets between herself and Elon Musk (EM), but insists that she didn’t have any affairs with anyone while she was with Johnny, not even EM. She wasn’t even in communication with him, she claiMs., until 2016. She says an earlier witness, Alejandro Romero, is wrong about seeing her with Musk at an earlier date.</p>
<p>There is a little back and forth now between Ms. Laws and the judge over whether talk of jealousy is relevant. Heard says in some ways ""all jealousy is illogical.” The judge is not keen to get into philosophical conversations, and moves the subject on.</p>
<p>The court is now being shown CCTV footage which shows Heard in a lift with actor James Franco. Ms. Laws asks if it is indeed Franco, and Heard says yes. Heard says Franco was saying: ""Oh my god, what happened to you?"" when he saw her face after she went down to let him in. She says his words were ""What the f***.” Ms. Laws asks if they were ""trying to hide their faces"" in the video, and Heard says no. Ms. Laws asks if it was ""secretive talking.” Heard says it was ""discreet talking.”</p>
<p>We now move onto other events around May 2016. Heard says a text she sent at the time saying she was fearful of Depp was correct, telling Ms. Laws: ""That is true, I was petrified of the monster.” We also hear about part of Heard's statement, in which she says she went to her friends Rocky and Josh's apartment (which was in the same apartment block) to seek refuge from Depp following a big argument on 21 May 2016. In it, she says ""I did not hear from Johnny any more.”</p>
<p>Ms. Laws reads out multiple texts sent by Heard to Depp's late head of security Jerry Judge on 24 May 2016, which seem to show her trying to get in contact with Depp. One reads, ""Please call me as soon as you get this""; another ""I'm desperately trying to reach Johnny, can you help?"" and another ""I love you precious.” Heard agrees she was trying to reach Depp. <br>Ms. Laws says this is not the truth, as she was in contact with Depp between 21 and 26 May. But Heard says she was referring to that night, and the incident, and saying she did not see Depp any more that night. Ms. Laws says this is not true.</p>
<p>We now see a letter written by Heard's lawyer to Depp's lawyer on 24 May 2016, asking for their separation to be kept out of the public eye. Ms. Laws asks Heard: ""You didn't want publicity around this did you?"" Heard agrees. Heard says her lawyer ""told me I needed only the last couple of instances of violence, which had ironically been the last couple of times I saw Johnny.” The letter says there had been three instances of domestic violence in the last six months. When asked by Ms. Laws which instances these are, Heard says ""there are honestly so many, I don't recall which ones they are.” Ms. Laws says: ""Just days before this case started you remembered lots of new cases of alleged violence.” Ms. Heard says this is not true.</p>
<p>The judge explains to Heard that what Ms. Laws is getting at is that if there had been more instances of domestic violence, they would have been included in the letter. Heard says this is not so, and her lawyer said it was ""a short application.” Ms. Laws counters: ""You make things up as you go along.” That’s the second time in two days that Ms. Laws has used that statement. And IMHO, she was right both times.</p>
<p>On the 23 May, Heard filed for divorce. Ms. Laws says several people - Depp's artist friend Isaac Baruch and concierge manager Trinity Esparza - saw Heard on this day and both say Heard had no injuries. Heard says she doesn't recall seeing Ms. Esparza, but she does vaguely recall seeing Mr Baruch.</p>
<p>The following day, 24 May, Ms. Laws says Amber did see housekeeper Hilda Vargas. She also says she disputes Ms. Vargas's claim that she wasn't wearing make-up.</p>
<p>We also discuss stylist Samantha McMillan, who also said she saw Heard without make up, and saw no injuries. Heard disagrees and says: ""She has only seen me at photo shoots.” She says she only ever saw her with make up on. Heard says she would put make up on first thing in the day, and that as she is often photographed, this was how she would always appear. <br>Ms. Laws asks if that meant Ms. McMillan always arrived late to shoots. Ms. Laws says it is ""inconceivable"" Ms. McMillan would not have seen Heard without make up at some point. <br>Heard says this is not so.</p>
<p><br>Ms. Laws says the letter from Heard's lawyer to Depp's was a form of ""blackmail.” You know, the one where she demanded everything from the apartment and his car to spousal support, right down to Johnny paying for Amber’s laundry. Heard says this is not so, and that she wanted to let him know ""this could be done amicably.” <br>Heard says she was not afraid to talk to Depp on the phone, but was afraid of him. Ms. Laws says this is not true, and that Heard was not afraid of Depp, she was simply wanting it to seem like she was.</p>
<p>The court is now being shown more CCTV footage - it is black and white with no sound - and shows Heard in the lift with her sister and Rocky Pennington. They are heading out of the apartment. Ms. Laws says it shows Herd - who is on the far left - had no bruise on her cheek. In similar footage, as the three women return home that night, we can again see Heard standing by the lift doors. Heard says it was at around 10 or 11pm. Ms. Laws now moves on to a few hours later, in the early hours of the same night. Heard says ""my memory is not clear"" on events on that night. Ms. Laws says she would remember if she called her lawyer first that night. Talking again about the letter between lawyers, which mentions three alleged domestic violence incidents, Heard says: ""I was trying to protect Johnny. I wasn't ready to reveal everything I'd been trying to hide for four-and-a-half years.”</p>
<p>Heard is discussing texts she sent to Depp around the time she filed for divorce. She says: ""I wanted him to understand I loved him, and it didn't need to be any more acrimonious than it already was.  I just wanted privacy.” She goes on: ""As naive as it sounds, at the time, just a few days of privacy seemed like an enormous thing to me.” One text from Heard says: ""I thought you'd filed.” Heard confirMs. this meant she thought Depp had or was going to file for divorce.</p>
<p>Another lift clip is shown to the court, this time in color and filmed on the 23 May 2016. Heard is in the lift with Rocky and interior designer Laura Divenere. Ms. Laws says they were all up close in the lift. Now a second clip of the lobby is being played, showing Heard in the lobby taking to Ms. Esparza. Again, they are talking over the desk and seem very close to one another. ""You had no injury did you?"" Ms. Laws asks. She goes on, ""And it's wrong to say you rarely communicated with the staff.” <br>Heard answers: ""Ms. Laws, I lived in that flat a long time and I talked to them on occasions.” She says she did not “often” talk with them.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws references a clip where she says Heard and her sister Whitney ""acted out some sort of punching scene.” <br>Heard says this is not true. We are not shown any clip of this.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws asks if Heard saw Isaac Baruch after she had filed for a restraining order. She asks: ""Did you see him afterwards, and ask him out to dinner?"" <br>Heard answers: ""I did see him, but I didn't ask him out to dinner, I asked him if he wanted something I had cooked. He liked my cooking.”</p>
<p>We now move on to a telephone call between Depp and Heard. Heard says she believes this call is ""one Johnny asked me if I was recording, and I said no, and he recorded it."" Ms. Laws says: ""Let's be clear, this is a recording you have provided yourself. So you know about this call.” In this phone call, reference is made to a ""secret fight club.” Ms. Laws says that when she asked Heard if she knew which transcript they were discussing, and mentioned ""secret fight club"" she denied knowledge of it. Heard denies this, and says it's because Ms. Laws ""mis-spoke.” Ms. Laws says Heard has made the point ""four times"" that she didn't know which transcript Ms. Laws was talking about, and she is now moving on. Ms. Laws asks: ""Are you unhappy that you recorded this conversation?.” Heard says no, she is unhappy that Depp told her he wasn't recording the conversation, and then she found out he was. She says they often recorded conversations between theMs.elves. Ms. Laws says Heard received ""bad publicity after she filed"" and Heard was ""angry about this.” Heard says: ""I was angry, but mostly heartbroken. My marriage had ended, it was a really hard time.” Ms. Laws says during the recorded phone conversation violence from the past is discussed. Ms. Laws reads out an extract from the transcript in which Depp says ""I had a jar of mineral spray thrown at my f***ing nose.” It also mentions him losing the tip of his finger and Heard allegedly being violent towards him. Ms. Laws puts it to Heard that she had been violent to Depp, and she didn't deny it in the call. <br>Heard says: ""I wasn't in a place to deny or agree to it. I was trying to point out to him the reality of the system and how nasty, and violent this whole thing had been.” She goes on: ""Johnny surrounded hiMs.elf with people who wouldn't disagree with him.” She says he was ""almost never in contact with outside world.” Heard says Depp ""severed his own finger.” She says Depp's ""perception of our relationship was so skewed"" he didn't realise how bad things were. Heard says: ""He was twice my size and beat me up for years.” She says ""it's preposterous"" Depp says he was the victim of violence. <br>IMHO, what’s preposterous is Heard saying that Johnny is twice her size. She stands nearly as tall as him, and is perfectly capable of swinging a fist.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, Amber’s making good use of her water bottle, sipping from it liberally.</p>
<p>We are now talking about the night of Heard's 30th birthday party on 21 May 2016. Ms. Laws asks if when Depp arrived he was ""coherent, sociable, logical and you were affectionate towards one another.” <br>Heard says, ""Yes, but he was also under the influence and high.” Ms. Laws says Heard is the only one alleging that, and Heard says that's not true.</p>
<p>We hear that Depp had received ""monumental news"" about his finances that evening, before arriving at the birthday meal. During Depp's evidence last week he told the court he lost $650m when former business managers ""stole"" his money.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws reads out texts from Depp to Heard, which seem to show Depp apologising for being late. There is a little confusion over the date of these texts, and Heard says she thinks they might be from the day before the birthday party. Confusingly, the texts are actually dated the 22nd May, which would make them the day after. <br>Heard says she thinks they are from before the party, as they mention ""fittings for the Met Gala.” She has to repeat ""Met Gala"" for the judge, who doesn't seem too familiar with the event.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws says Heard knew Depp had an important meeting with his accountant, and Heard says is aware that he had the meeting. Ms. Laws says after the party Heard ""went on and on"" at Depp over being late. Heard says she was ""upset he was late for my birthday.” <br>Heard says he had scheduled his meeting just half an hour before her celebratory meal, and was still late. Ms. Laws asks whether Heard ""punched Depp in the face"" on that night. Heard replied ""Absolutely not.” <br>Ms. Laws says Depp called his security guard Sean Bett to come and get him. <br>Heard says, ""Johnny didn't drive, he was driven. It was normal for him to call someone to drive him after he would beat-up on me.” <br>We hear a text exchange in which Depp says Heard ""hay-makered me.” This US phrase means to punch wildly. Ms. Laws says Heard did not dispute this in the texts.</p>
<p>The following day Heard's friend Rocky came to her flat, and Ms. Laws says Heard did not tell her Depp had hit her. Heard says this is not true, and she had texted Rocky the night before to tell her there had been an incident. ""When she [Rocky] walked into the room it was covered in glass from things Johnny had thrown at me. Johnny was fond of glass bottles.” Heard says Rocky saw all the damage. That day Heard, her sister and a group of friends headed out to Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. <br>Heard is asked if she was excited about going to Coachella. <br>Heard answers: ""I couldn't be excited, my husband had beaten me up on my 30th birthday.” <br>Ms. Laws asks: ""And then you excreted on the bed?"" <br>Heard says she did not, and ""it's absolutely disgusting.” <br>Ms. Laws asks if it was one of Heard's friends who had messed on the bed, and Heard says no, it's ""unimaginable to me.” <br>Heard says Yorkshire Terrier Boo had had a problem with messing herself ""since the weed.” She explains that when Boo was a puppy she ate a bag of Depp's marijuana, and had had issues since then. <br>Heard is asked if cleaner Hilda Vargas regularly cleaned up after the dogs (Pistol and Boo), and Heard says occasionally. <br>Heard says she would usually clean up excrement in the bed as she thought it was unfair for the cleaner to have to deal with it. Heard says Boo would often cuddle with Johnny, and mess herself on him or the bed. She says she heard Ms. Vargas giving evidence last week. In that, we heard that Ms. Vargas believed the excrement to be human rather than animal. ""I cannot imagine what kind of human being would do that for a prank or joke"" Heard tells the court. She says she was not there though, and had headed to Coachella by this time. Heard says she does not recall if she took the dogs with her or not.</p>
<p>We are now moving on to what Ms. Laws calls the ""bathroom incident.” Heard says there were many incidents involving the bathroom, and involving doors, so asks for more clarity on which incident this was. The court is about to be played some audio, which we are told is undated. We can hear Depp talking in this, but his voice is very muted. He seeMs. to be apologising for closing the door into Heard's toes. He says: ""I didn't mean to do that.” We can now hear Heard, who is saying she did not mean to push the door into Depp, but reacted to the door hitting her toes. She says ""It was not my intention.” We can hear Heard saying ""I'm so sorry. I can remember hitting you as a response. And I'm really sorry about hitting you in the head with the door.” She goes on, ""I just reacted and I'm sorry, it's below me."" <br>Ms. Laws asks: ""You admitted punching him in the face there?"" <br>Heard says: ""No.” <br>Ms. Laws says: ""And it was not in self-defence was it?"" <br>Heard answers: ""That's exactly what it was.” She says at the time Depp was ""falling against the door and screaming out incoherently.” <br>She says she had previously kept an eye on him to check he wasn't choking on his own vomit. She says she ""pushed the door as an instinct. to get it off of me as it was putting pressure on my body.” Heard says: ""I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him. My job was to say sorry, and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.” She says doing so would have ""made him more mad, enraged, and he would have got more violent with me.” <br>Ms. Laws says every time there is evidence showing Ms. Heard admitting to violence, she ""turns it round"" and alleges self-defence. ""It's what you do isn't it?"" Ms. Laws adds.</p>
<p>We are now about to be played audio of another conversation between Depp and Heard. Again, this audio is hard to hear. We hear Heard saying: ""You're trying to justify how you do or don't come to the door.” <br>Depp says: ""You seem to think there's this cowardice in me, running away from me.” He says ""the only time I did things to you was when you threw the can at me in Australia.” <br>We hear Heard saying she ""threw pots and pans.” <br>Ms. Laws asks if Heard said in the audio that was in self-defence? <br>Heard answers ""that was not the point of the conversation.”<br>Ms. Laws says in this case Heard ""does not want to ever admit to using violence against Mr Depp. You don't want to admit the truth - that you were violent do you?"" <br>Heard says this is not true.</p>
<p>We now hear about what Ms. Laws calls the stair incident, which Ms. Laws says was ""very violent.” <br>Ms. Heard says she was only ever violent ""in defence of myself and my sister.” <br>Ms. Laws says Heard spat at Depp. <br>Heard answers: ""I never spit at anyone"" <br>Ms. Laws says Heard threw a can of Red Bull at Depp's back. <br>Heard answers: ""I don't even drink Red Bull, no.” <br>Ms. Laws says Heard punched Depp in the face. <br>Heard agrees: ""I did strike Johnny that day, in defence of my sister.” <br>Heard says the reason for this is: ""I heard the rumour he pushed an ex-girlfriend down the stairs - I think it was Kate Moss - and that was fresh in my mind. So I reacted quickly."" Heard goes on: ""I have been Johnny's punching bag for years. And I remember this as it was the first incident when I ever struck him back. Ms. Laws puts it to Heard that this is the first time she has ever mentioned Kate Moss in relation to this incident. <br>For a second (third) time Ms. Laws tells Heard: ""You are making this up as you go along.” <br>Ms. Laws says there has been no mention of Moss in Heard's deposition, and she has never before said this was the reason she ""punched Depp"" during the stair incident. The court is now being played Heard's deposition, which was also shown in court yesterday. In the deposition Heard is asked ""have you ever hit Johnny Depp?"" <br>Heard is told by her lawyers, ""You don't have to answer.”<br>She says she was protecting ""my baby sister"" and she jumped up to ""act defensively to protect her life.” She says ""I would have done anything to prevent her from being pushed down the stairs. She says any sibling or parent would do the same. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she didn't mention Moss in the deposition. <br>Heard says: ""I didn't have a chance.” <br>Ms. Laws asks if Heard has mentioned Moss in any statement, deposition or evidence so far. <br>Heard agrees she has not. Heard says ""She had anything but the freedom to speak"" and was ""surrounded by 14 lawyers"" on the recorded deposition shown to the court. <br><a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/LMT5MrirBwU7b3aoqCnRWg/https/media.fyre.co/RU3QItsVTziZ05gQGGlH_GettyImages-75480804.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/LMT5MrirBwU7b3aoqCnRWg/https/media.fyre.co/RU3QItsVTziZ05gQGGlH_GettyImages-75480804.jpg</a> <br>For a third (fourth) time Ms. Laws says: ""You are making this up as you go along sometimes. You add information you have thought of on your feet to try to make your account more detailed.” <br>Heard refutes this.</p>
<p>We have now moved on to an alleged attack on Heard by Depp on 23 March 2015, when he is said to have pulled her by the hair and hit her.</p>
<p>Heard tells the court: ""He hit me with the hard plaster cast, and my sister Whitney. It was particularly unpleasant.” <br>At the time Depp had his finger in a cast due to an injury sustained in Australia. He chose one of the children's designs for the cast, with a picture of a baby dinosaur on in. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she did not mention the cast in her statement. Heard says she cannot mention every accessory or detail of every incident.</p>
<p>After the lunch break, the court is shown a photo of Heard with Rolling Stone Keith Richards, along with her sister. Heard confirMs. she is second left in the picture. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard if it's correct there is no bruise on her cheek. <br>Heard says she cannot tell.<br><a href=""https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/rRkWYKCWHX99xoLSA3I_xg/https/media.fyre.co/8pCmJR7gRWjNEXyPkoHs_Keith%20Richards%20photo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/rRkWYKCWHX99xoLSA3I_xg/https/media.fyre.co/8pCmJR7gRWjNEXyPkoHs_Keith%20Richards%20photo.jpg</a> <br>Heard says this photo was taken ""right before"" the painting incident. She says her previous reference to ""disco bloodbath"" was actually in relation to another fight, not the argument over a painting by her ex-partner Tasya Van Ree. Heard has alleged Depp hit her because the picture was hung up in her bedroom, and that Depp tried to set fire to art work.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws now asks detailed questions about the ""disco bloodbath"" fight. She asks: ""How did he hit you in such a way that blood spattered on the wall?"" <br>Heard says: ""Back then it was just slaps or backhands, and at the time it was a shock. I felt his rings hit my mouth, my teeth."" <br>Ms. Laws asks: ""How close were you?"" <br>Heard answers: ""We were at his downtown place in the Eastern Columbia building. All the details of these incidents remain true. I remember them perfectly. There has been a mistake with dates. That particular incident which we called disco bloodbath happened on the 8th, downtown. "" <br>Ms. Laws now tries to interrupt, but the judge cuts in saying: ""It's easier if I can hear one person at a time.” He says Hurd is answering the question, and he wants to hear it. <br>Heard goes on: ""All I can tell you is Johnny wore these rings. He backhanded me. We got into an argument because he said I'd had affairs with two people I never had an affair with.” Heard says the blow ""popped my teeth.” She says she was standing next to the living room, and she recalls ""the next day there was blood next to the Smeg fridge. The next day Johnny made a joke about it.” Heard says the wall was around two or three feet away from her at the time. <br>Ms. Laws is keen to know the angle and exact proximity. <br>Ms. Laws is now asking: ""What did the blood spatter look like?"" <br>Heard says she cannot recall, going on: ""We made light of it. It's hard to believe, but I was so quick to think it would never happen again."" <br>""How many drops of blood?,” Ms. Laws asks. <br>The judge interrupts again and says he doesn't think knowing the exact amount of blood is helpful.<br>Ms. Laws is putting it to Heard that she changed her account of the date of the alleged painting incident as there was the Keith Richards photo showing her with a clear face the day after the alleged fight. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard shifted the painting fight to 22 March 2013, and said the disco bloodbath fight happened on the 8 March. <br>Heard says no, she had no need to change the dates, and that she has always said the disco bloodbath was on 8 March. <br>The judge asks for clarification of what ""disco bloodbath"" means. <br>Heard says: ""He hit me, and split my lip, a blood went on the wall and on my shirt.” She says the phrase was used by Depp later, and is the title of a book. She says she asked him if that was in reference to the alleged fight on Friday. <br>Ms. Laws tells Heard she has ""missed an important detail"" in her statement, and that's why she changed the date. <br>Heard says that is not the case, but says there were ""so many incidents in March"" that she got mixed up as to what happened at each one.</p>
<p>We are now looking at the Keith Richards photo again, and Amber says she can't be sure there isn't damage to her face. She says: ""My bottom lip looks swollen to me.” <br>Sasha Wass, the lawyer for The Sun, has now interjected. <br>The judge is getting a little cross over lawyers in court talking over each other, and says for a second time he can only listen to one person at a time.</p>
<p>Heard is now being asked to look at screen shots taken on 7 April 2013. <br>Ms. Laws says we will also be discussing flight details relating to a man called Ian Patrick McLagan, who has played the guitar for the Rolling Stones.<br>Ms. Laws asks, ""You have seen these documents before haven't you?"" <br>Heard says she has seen so many documents she can't tell, and then adds ""I don't think I have seen this.” <br>Ms. Laws says it's these flight details that have caused Heard to change her dates in her earlier statement. <br>Heard refutes this.<br>The documents include an email chain about flights and travel to set. Depp's lawyer Stephen Deuters is cc'd in.</p>
<p>Ms. Heard says she ""vaguely recognizes"" the second photo with Ian Patrick McLagan.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws says Heard hasn't just changed the dates, she has also ""shifted the more lurid and graphic"" accounts to earlier in the timeline (specifically 8 March), to explain her clear face in the dated photos.<br>Ms. Laws says Heard is ""treading a fine line"" as her sister Whitney has already said in her statement that Heard had a split lip after the painting incident. <br>Heard says no, the truth is that Depp ""hit me a lot in March."" <br>We now look at Heard's sister's statement - Whitney Henriquez - talking about arriving at Heard's apartment after the painting incident. Whitney says when she came home on the day Depp should have been filming a documentary with Keith Richards, she came home ""and the place was a mess.” She says the painting had been taken off the wall, and she noticed the signature of the painting had been altered. <br>Whitney also says ""it was apparent she [Heard] had been crying, her face was swollen. I noticed that one side of her face was super-red and she had a split lip."" <br>Ms. Laws tells Heard: ""Your sister has made the made mistake as you, saying you had a red face and swollen lip on the day you went to the filming of the Keith Richard's documentary."" <br>Ms. Laws says this is a description of an ""obvious and clear injury, which we can't see in any of the photographs."" <br>Ms. Laws goes on: ""You have quite a difficult path to tread because of all the lies you've woven. You've woven a web of lies which you've had to shift and change because of evidence that's come to light around this Keith Richards documentary."" <br>Heard disagrees.<br>We are now looking at a photo of the painting, which shows the altered signature, changed from ""Taysa van Ree"" to ""Taysa van Pee’ <br>We hear a text message exchange between Depp and Whitney, in which Whitney seeMs. to be cheering him on for defacing the image. <br>One reads: ""She' s the worst,” apparently referring to van Ree. <br>The judge asks if Heard has ""tried to construct an incident around these documents’ <br>Heard says no, ""It's a totally different painting, and I don't think Johnny realised that’ <br>Heard says Depp defaced multiple paintings, and ""the one he tried to light on fire was a canvas’  <br>Ms. Laws says ""multiple paintings"" is now ""another detail added’ <br>Heard says the number of paintings he destroyed was ""countless’ <br>For the fourth (fifth) time, Ms. Laws tells Heard she is ""making it up as she goes along’ <br>Heard says in the text exchange, which seeMs. to say she also found the image tampering ""funny,” it is because on that occasion ""you could wipe the mark off the glass’ She says Ms. Laws is mixing up two different painting incidents, one in 2012 and one in 2014. <br>Heard says: ""I didn't shift anything’</p>
<p>After a 10minute break, they went into the three day ""hostage situation"" Heard says she suffered at the hands of Depp in early March 2015. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard has alleged ""extreme acts of physical, emotional and psychological violence"" in her earlier violence. <br>Ms. Laws says she wants to find out exactly what physical violence took place.<br>A sentence in Heard's statement says: ""I fell like a rag doll.  I got back up and he said something like “You want to go? You want to fight, tough guy?” and he slapped me in the face."" <br>Another says: "" He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me against the fridge’ It goes on: ""Over the course of the day, he kept attacking me – he hit me, pushed me, choked me and spat in my face."" <br>Ms. Laws goes on to another extract which reads: ""I tried to run past him to get away and he grabbed me by the hair, hurled me around. I fell onto the ping pong table and it collapsed under me. He ended up on top of me."" <br>In Another part of the statement about the same incident, Heard says Depp ""ripped off my gown"" and later smashed her phone so hard ""It broke into pieces’ <br>Ms. Laws now moves on to an alleged incident on day two of the ""three day incident’ <br>In her statement Heard says: "" Glass was broken everywhere – on the floor and the counter-top. At some point he pulled me around by my neck and pushed me down against the bar, I was against the bar, naked, bent over backwards, my back against the marble. He was pressing so hard on my neck I couldn’t breathe. <br>A visibly and audibly upset Heard now tells the court: ""I was naked and my feet were bare, so I couldn't get a purchase on my feet... I was trying to push away from the counter top so I could breathe. I thought he had lost control of what he had done, I was slipping on the counter tops and slipping on the glass’ <br>Heard is crying a little as she says this. <br>In her statement Heard says she still has scars from the glass on her feet and arMs..</p>
<p>As the cross-examination moves to a photo taken of the injuries Heard alleges occurred on the trip, she wipes her nose with a tissue. <br>Heard says she took these photos herself in the bathroom. <br>Talking about the photos, Ms. Laws says: ""These are not scars sustained writhing around on the floor trying to get away from Mr Depp. They are straight."" <br>Heard says: ""I do not agree, I know they are’ <br>Ms. Laws suggests they are ""self-harm scars, inflicted by you’<br>Heard answers: ""I have had them since that night... I have never self-harmed. Johnny's a self-harmer, I'm not a self-harmer."" <br>Ms. Laws is now questioning Heard's comparison of the situation with being ""a hostage’ She says, ""You could have left at any time couldn't you?’ She goes on, ""And you had a cell phone didn't you - you could have called anyone at any point’ <br>Heard accepts she did have a phone, and could have called someone. <br>However Heard says she has not mis-characterised the situation, saying: ""Absolutely not. This was my marriage. I lived in it.”<br>Ms. Laws says the three days are a ""graphic depiction of the three day hostage situation,” and questions why Heard didn't record any of this at the time. <br>Heard says that Depp had ""taken eight to ten MDMA on the first night, maybe even more. There was no valuable conversation between us that would have been worth recording.""<br>Ms. Laws is asking about a phone call from Heard to her sister shortly after the Australia incident. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she did not tell her sister about what had happened. <br>Heard says: ""I can't remember what I said to her, but I certainly wouldn't have recalled everything that had happened to me.”<br>We are now talking about an audio recording, which appears to have been taken on Heard's phone but which she says Depp recorded. The audio is said to last ""seven or eight hours.” <br>Heard says ""years later"" she realised Depp had recorded it, and she only understood this once it ""came up in my divorce proceedings.” <br>Ms. Laws asks why this is not mentioned in her statements. <br>Ms. Heard says she can't mention everything. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard when she discovered her phone after the recording had been taken. <br>Heard says it was the next day, as she ""had been given some drugs, and slept.” <br>Ms. Laws asked how Heard managed to call her sister if the phone was recording, and Heard says maybe on her iPad or through Facetime, but she ""has no recollection of that call.” <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard: ""You use your phone a lot and don't like to be away from your phone?"" <br>Heard answers: ""I wouldn't characterize myself that way.""<br>Ms. Laws is asking Heard if she ever listened to the long audio file on her phone. <br>Heard says: ""At some point, but maybe I just read transcripts, I can't remember.” <br>There is also apparently a second recording, taken several hours later. <br>The judge asks if Heard knows if it was her phone that recorded both. Heard says she doesn't know, ""But that was my suspicion.” <br>He then asks if she called her sister on her phone. <br>Heard says: ""I can't remember making that call.” <br>Heard asks the judge if she can ask a question. <br>The judge says: ""This is a one-way process , so it's not for you to ask questions to Ms. Laws.” He asks Ms. Laws to continue in her questioning.</p>
<p>Ms. Laws is asking where Heard spoke to her sister, and whether it was upstairs. <br>Again, Heard says she can't remember, but she says she did go upstairs at some point. <br>Ms. Laws is pushing the point that she wants to know why the phone has recorded a conversation with her sister, close by the phone, but she was not using the phone itself. <br>Heard says Jerry Judge (Depp's late head of security) was downstairs. <br>Ms. Laws asks why heard was not looking for her phone. <br>Heard answers: ""After everything I'd been through, strangled, hit, sexually assaulted, the last thing I was thinking about was where my cell phone was.”<br>Ms. Laws is asking Heard why she returned to a bedroom she claiMs. she had been assaulted in, to which the actress replies: ""It was not the room that was the problem.""  </p>
<p>Talk then returns to an allegation made yesterday in court by Heard, that Depp took her vintage Ford Mustang from her. <br>We move on to documentation over an MOT. However, at this point, the judge suggests it's a good place to end for the day.</p>
<p>Don’t even get me started on how ludicrous this testimony is or this update will be twice as long. Suffice it to say I’m outraged over the bullsh*t that got dropped by Amber Heard today.</p>

<p>Inside the court, things started off with few legal arguments back and forth about the allowance and review of some written submissions that were apparently put in at the last minute, doesn’t say what they are. The judge gave both parties until 1pm tomorrow to review and respond to them.</p>
<p>The defense also complained about Adam Waldman tweeting his “In memoriam” tweet from court and asked that AW be forced to desist from tweeting. DS called this a stunt, but the judge agreed that the phrase “In memoriam” is unwelcome because it might be misconstrued as a threat and left it there. AW wasn’t instructed not to tweet, as I understand it.</p>
<p>Amber Heard takes the stand wearing a short-sleeved light colored v-neck blouse with her hair braided over one shoulder. She confirms that her witness statement is true and correctly signed. Now that she’s been sworn in, her witness statement will be released to the public and we’ll be able to see what nonsense she’s come up with, including whatever she testifies to in private.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, Amber’s witness statement starts off painting her as the poor little victim to Johnny Depp’s “monster” getting brutalized, and woe is her, the poor little thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She also insisted that he tried to control her professional life, reviewing her scripts and berating any romantic scenes she was in and insinuating that he told her what parts she could or couldn’t take based on whether or not there were nudity or romantic scenes. And she said that he began to say that she dressed like a whore and began to tell her what she could and couldn’t wear. She certainly did her homework about what real victims go through. Pity, though, that this is the first we’re hearing about all this, four years later. She even said that Johnny said that he hoped she’d get raped by “Slimy Mexicans” or a big gang of black MF-ers because of the sexy or revealing clothes she wore, accusing him not only of verbal abuse, but also of using racial slurs to do it with.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is all in her witness statement. She hasn’t begun to testify yet.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, Amber shows what a liar she is. Throughout her relationship with Johnny, she kept her house on Orange Ave, which means that she was never in danger of being homeless, like she claimed when trying to keep Johnny’s penthouse.</p>
<p>Also from the beginning, the female barrister isn’t having any of Amber’s showboating (which I almost misspelled as sow-boating, which would have been just as appropriate). Whenever Amber tried to add or embellish, FB yanked the chain and got the subject succinctly back on track.</p>
<p>FB’s first questions to Amber were about her family and friends that came to live in the Eastern Columbia building penthouses rent free.</p>
<p>Next, Amber admitted that she didn’t sign a prenup, nor was she asked to. But FB produced an email from David Kipper (a doctor) saying that Johnny and Amber had been fighting non-stop because he wanted a prenup. So she didn’t get five minutes in without contradicting herself with a lie. It also bears mention that Amber is so animated and agitated that the judge asked her to slow down with her answers.</p>
<p>They went back and forth about the prenup that never got signed, with Amber managing to get in that JD beat her up over it, of course. It’s rather hard to keep up with AH because she seemingly contradicts herself with every breath. There was no prenup, then there was. First Johnny wanted it, then it was his sister Cristy who wanted it, as well as a litany of his friends. But in the end, there WAS a prenup that simply never got signed.</p>
<p>She said at least twice that Johnny insisted that the only way out of the marriage was death. Implying, I supposed that he’d kill her before he’d let her go. Painting him as that monster again. Joke’s on her, innit? Because he did let her go.</p>
<p>Once again, the judge stops Amber from giving such lengthy answers that stray from the question. FB made this easier by asking a series of yes or no questions. Love her!</p>
<p>ML is FB asked about Amber’s statement that she didn’t take cocaine after the age of 18. Amber insisted that it was true, and that she didn’t take coke in front of Johnny, ever.</p>
<p>I swear, it’s almost impossible to keep up with Amber’s answers because she either contradicts herself so much, or she picks a fringe point to answer without addressing the direct question. Asked if she had coke issues, she says she never had anxiety eating disorders, which was mentioned, but wasn’t the point at all.</p>
<p>Amber insists that she never had anxiety eating disorder, is not bipolar, and never had a substance abuse problem. Dr Kipper, who wrote notes about all of the above, is either lying, got it wrong, or made a mistake. He’s the one, she says, that put her on such a range of meds that she’s lost track of them all.</p>
<p>ML nailed AH on taking drugs at Coachella, where Amber’s memory seems spotty about who she took MDMA and mushrooms with. First Amber said that she took them, but doesn’t remember who she took them with, then changed her story to say that she didn’t take them, and still doesn’t remember who she didn’t take them with. ML reminds her that it’s a high profile male she’s talking about, but Amber still feigns amnesia about it.</p>
<p>Amber then denies taking MDMA or mushrooms in Australia. She insists that she’s only done shrooms or MDMA (ecstasy) a handful of times, including Coachella and her bachelorette party. So Coachella’s back on the map. ML: So lots of medical professionals are either lying or misrepresenting Heard’s drug use? Amber blames it on Johnny, saying that HE misrepresented her drug use to all these people.</p>
<p>Amber denies being the one who puked in the parking lot at Coachella, insisting that she’s never barfed in a parking lot in her life. Instead, she blames the vomiting incident on her (then) pregnant sister. But a note/email to a friend says that Amber admitted to puking in the parking lot and being high for 24 hours. Amber tried to turn it around on Johnny, saying that he’s the one that did drugs, but ML (love her!) asked Amber to try to answer the question without making negative comments about her ex-husband. Amber had to agree to just answer the questions.</p>
<p>It bears noting that at every step of Amber’s testimony, netizens in the Twitterverse were posting screen grabs that directly contradict her. And a picture is worth a thousand words. If you haven’t followed Nick Wallis on Twitter, it’s worth looking him up, reading his spot-on live tweeting, and having a look at the comments. They tell the real story, unlike Amber.</p>
<p>Next, ML asked about Amber’s allegation that Johnny took her mustang away from her for 3.5 years, or longer, Amber added. She says he took the car and had his drivers take her everywhere so that he could keep tabs on where he was going. Maybe it’s just me, but I wouldn’t care if he knew where I was if I wasn’t doing something shady. There was some discussion at length about Johnny fixing the car up on the tv show Overhaulin in order to get out of paying for it and how Amber alleges that the car didn’t work right after the show – despite the plethora of photos she’s taken of herself driving “Cherry Thunder” as she’s dubbed it. How this has anything to do with the Sun calling Johnny a wife-beater is beyond me, but hey. What do I know?</p>
<p>They moved on to a matter of whether or not Samantha McMillen worked for, and was paid by, Amber Heard. Amber insists that SM never worked for her during a certain period, that she was only along as a “friend” or unpaid intern, but EL refers to a document where Amber admits to paying SM $1,300, complete with a photocopy of a check. To be honest, I don’t know what this has to do with the Sun, either, but it certainly does discredit Amber’s integrity as a witness, insisting that SM wasn’t her assistant, despite SM getting paid.</p>
<p>Amber was asked about her temper, and admitted that she had outbursts of rage during arguments with JD, but evidence was presented that Amber just has a bad temper in general, and has outbursts with more people than just Johnny Depp. Proven.</p>
<p>They played the tape where Amber admits to punching/hitting him, and admits to starting the fight. But Amber still insists that she was only reacting to Johnny’s violence towards her. Regarding the bathroom door incident, she says that she only pushed the door to keep Johnny from falling down, because, she says, he had a tendency to pass out drunk and vomit all over himself. Everyone who says she was the violent one, she says, is lying for Johnny. She only acted in self-defense.</p>
<p>After lunch, they stuck to the topic of Amber’s temper, which she said only got out of hand with Johnny, and only in response to his violence toward her. EL puts forth that that’s not true, and addresses Amber’s arrest for domestic violence against Tasya Van Ree in Washington in 2009. Amber insists that her relationship with Van Ree is the most peaceful relationship that she’s ever heard of, despite evidence of screaming matches and that arrest which Amber downplays as a non-event.</p>
<p>Moving on, EL talked about the day Amber went to court and the fact that there was so much press. EL asked if Amber tipped off the press. She said no and blamed the press being there on Johnny’s lawyers and TMZ – despite the fact that the TMZ article came out well before that. So, no dice there. She says that IF there was a leak of information, it didn’t come from her. It came from somebody else, either on behalf without her knowing, or that it was Johnny’s team. Anybody but her.</p>
<p>EL then questioned Amber as to why she wanted to meet with Johnny when the restraining order was in effect if she was so petrified of him. Amber gave some half-arsed statement about how she wasn’t afraid of Johnny, she was afraid of the monster.</p>
<p>Amber was then asked about the night of the fight where Amber says Johnny threw a phone at her face. Amber admits that Rocky Pennington, iO Tillet-Wright and Josh Drew were in the adjoining apartment. Not their own penthouses, as has been previously declared. She also admits that she called her lawyer and her publicist, as well as iO calling the police.</p>
<p>Every time She was caught lying by somebody else’s testimony and evidence, Amber was asked, “So are they lying?” She said she didn’t want to call anyone a liar, but then proceeded to call them a liar. She must have said that half a dozen times. Most of what they talked about has been said before, all about the night of that fateful fight and the aftermath. This accounting is long and rambling enough, so I’m not going to repeat it all. Suffice it to say that She says Johnny beat her up, hit her with a phone, and wrecked PH5 where she kept all her personal stuff, including her wardrobe. So, EL asked if the police officers were lying when they said they saw no damage to the property. Amber avoided giving a yes or no answer by saying things like “They must have seen it,” or “I don’t know how they could have missed it.”</p>
<p>At one point, EL said: “You’re making this up as you go along.” AH denied it, of course, but I LOVE EL for saying it.”</p>
<p>I also love that EL is showing pictures of the magical moving disappearing bruises and asking her to explain them, as well as whey they weren’t there the next day, and why people have testified that she had no marks on her at all. The answers are that the pictures were taken a different day, or she was wearing concealer, and everyone is lying.</p>
<p>And that was it for the day. And, unless somebody else steps up to live-tweet, that’s pretty much it for my timely updates. I’ve relied upon Nick Wallis’ brilliant live-tweeting for my updates, and he sadly won’t be able to do it anymore. So let’s all say thank you to Nick, and look forward to whatever updates might come our way.</p>","{'id': '224310705', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/da/yv/GgDAYVbkVMexeDi-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595259787', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
170,StarterPetitionUpdate,27322204,2020-07-18T17:15:40.000Z,,Day 9,"<p>First up today was Isaac Baruch, an artist and friend of Johnny Depp’s since they were teens. Mr. Baruch resided in the Eastern Columbia building at the time of all these goings on. Right out of the gate, QC tries to twist his words and put words in his mouth that he didn’t say. When IB testified that he saw no marks or bruises on the night of the fight, QC began testifying to the opposite. IB asked if there was a question in there somewhere. Likewise, the judge stepped in to put a stop to it, too, to keep the proceedings on track and timely. The QC questions were pretty general, bantering back and forth about how IB has known JD so long, lives rent-free at Johnny’s residence, and might therefore lie out of loyalty. The same old song and dance. Until the Question of Elon musk arose, relating to when EM visited, which dates and what time of day. Usually late at night until morning, and always when Johnny was away. But just as fast as that came up, it was glossed over. So the make takeaway from IB is that on the night that Amber said Johnny threw a phone at her face, she bore no marks at all. None.</p>
<p>Alejandro Romero is a concierge at the ECB. He was also questioned about EM visiting, from around March of 2016. QC called him a liar about the dates because they don’t match up with her narrative, but AR stood his ground. And that was about it for him. Honestly, I’m not sure what this accomplished in relation to a case of Libel against the Sun for calling Johnny a wife-beater, but maybe it’ll get tied up later.</p>
<p>Travis McGivern works (worked?) as a security guard for Johnny Depp. QC made short work of browbeating him when he disagreed with her timetable of when he entered Johnny’s penthouse on the night of the that Amber Heard alleges that she only hit Johnny Depp in defense of her sister, Whitney Heard, and with whom. QC asserted that TM entered the apartment with Amber’s nurse, Debbie Lloyd when Amber was already in the apartment, with the fight already underway. TM says that he met Amber in the lobby and left DL there with her and went up to the penthouse alone. Amber came up after and got into it with Johnny. TM is adamant that Amber is the only one that was physically violent, punching Johnny in the head.  QC started testifying again, but TM kept in line asking for a question and refusing to speculate when she asked him to. The takeaway from this line of questioning is that somebody in the room can testify to the fact that only Amber Heard was violent that night.</p>
<p>Amanda De Cadanet, founder of the #MeToo movement and former Amber Heard supporter, will not be questioned. She has publicly withdrawn her support for Amber Heard, so this comes as no great surprise. The last thing the defense wants is another explosive testimony supporting Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>After lunch, there was some debate about metadata and how easily it can be forged, in reference to the May 16, 2016 pictures that Amber Heard had taken. The times in all of those photos, according to metadata, is 00:00, which is impossible if metadata is correct. The bickering started to interfere with the timetable of the proceedings, so it will be decided by Monday morning.</p>
<p>Laura Devinere is an interior decorator and on again/off again friend of Amber Heard’s. She was sworn in and confirms her witness statement. The basic gist of her testimony is that she was terrified into signing a statement in support of Johnny Depp due to coercion on the part of Adam Waldman. She says she’s terrified of what Johnny’s lawyers were insinuating they would do to her. She says she didn’t want to get involved and was very uncomfortable giving a statement.</p>
<p>An interesting note is that the court played a recording of a conversation between LD and Amber that was recorded without LD’s knowledge or consent, which is illegal in the state of California. How many laws does Amber have to break, FFS? In the conversation that was taped, Amber drilled LD about what AW was saying to her, and honestly, it sounds like LD is terrified of Amber Heard, not Adam Waldman.</p>
<p>The main takeaway from LD seems to be that she was uncomfortable making that statement that she never saw any injuries on Amber Heard because of pressure she was under from Johnny’s team, but nowhere does she say that the statement is untrue in any way. So, while she may still be terrified of Amber, LD stands by her statement.</p>
<p>Due to previous commitments, that’s all I caught. Apologies. But I hope you found this information useful.</p>

171,StarterPetitionUpdate,27304713,2020-07-16T17:06:37.000Z,,Day 8,"<p>The biggest takeaway from today is that Neither Vanessa Paradis nor Winona Ryder will be called to testify. They say it’s because there’s no need, as the allegations are that Johnny Depp hit Amber Heard, not them, so they won’t be called at all.</p>
<p>I’m not gonna lie. I was looking forward to seeing Vanessa take Queen’s Counsel (QC) apart stitch by stitch.</p>
<p>Sean Bett, a former LA county sheriff, worked for Johnny Depp in the 90’s as a security guard and as his driver. He’s the security guard that took pictures of Johnny Depp’s face after Amber Heard’s 30th birthday party, when she admittedly punched him in the face. He also helped search for Johnny Depp’s phone after Amber Heard threw it out of the apartment. QC tried to minimalize SB’s interaction with Johnny Depp and his family, so that it would somehow matter less when SB testified that he never saw injuries on Amber Heard. She flat out called SB a liar, but SB said that she could call him a liar a hundred times. It doesn’t change the facts. SB had no problem whatsoever asserting the facts, despite repeatedly having his statements challenged. QC said that they would have to agree to disagree.</p>
<p>I disagree. We’re not dealing with matters of opinion, here. It doesn’t matter what QC thinks, it matters what she can prove.</p>
<p>The judge stepping in when QC tried to insinuate that Johnny Depp, as well as SB, were involved in a nightclub incident where a woman says she was roughed up and handcuffed by Johnny Depp’s security, who tried to pass themselves off as police officers. Judge told QC to stop testifying and ask a question. Thank goodness! QC has a tendency to testify rather than posing a question.</p>
<p>While Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis will not be called on to testify, their witness statements were released and available to read online.</p>
<p>They’re running behind, so Amber Heard will not take the stand tomorrow. She’ll have the whole weekend to best figure out how to spin some damage control, if she doesn’t spend the time clubbing or shopping.</p>
<p>There isn’t a schedule yet as to who will appear next, or when, but here’s a suggested list of who might take the stand tomorrow. Isaac Baruch, artist and friend of Johnny Depp. Travis McGivern, Building manager at the Eastern Columbia Building. And Katherine Kendall, an actor and #metoo advocate.</p>
<p>On a personal note, it’s been suggested that I take these updates too personally. Yes, I do, especially when a woman’s survival of rape is stolen and twisted by a narcissistic sociopath to read like it’s her own story, I do take it very personally. As a survivor, a woman, and as a human being. And I will NOT apologize for that.</p>
<p>More as it happens, folks.</p>","{'id': '224289131', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/sx/ar/iySxAREgNJkOTFB-800x450-noPad.jpg?1594919199', 'processing': False}}",,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,,against
172,StarterPetitionUpdate,27298052,2020-07-15T23:07:14.000Z,,Amber Heard's new Low,"<p>I have to admit that I was a little late to the game today. I did finally catch up and read all the tremendous live tweets from Nick Wallis. And I started to write a blow-by-blow series of events like I did yesterday, but there was one thing that happened today that I just can’t get past.</p>
<p>Kate James (KJ) was Amber Heard’s personal assistant. As such, Amber heard about a horrific incident that had happened in Kate’s life. When she was 26, Kate was raped at machete point for hours and barely escaped with her life.</p>
<p>And now, we find out that Amber Heard has taken <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec--4AqWoAEHkqm?format=jpg&amp;name=medium"" rel=""nofollow"">that story</a> and twisted it around as if it’s her own story.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about how this is textbook behavior for a narcissistic sociopath, but frankly, I’m too disgusted to look up the references. They’re out there if you want to look ‘em up yourself.</p>
<p>This perverted, despicable action is reportedly described in Amber Heard’s witness statement, to which we can’t be privy until after she’s been sworn in. So we’ll have to wait and see how similar Amber’s story is to Kates.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I can’t begin to describe how vile it is for Amber to take the single worst moment of a person’s life and use it for her own personal gain. What gain? I can only speculate that she’s going to accuse Johnny of being the one that raped her. I knew she was going to pull something for sympathy when she hit the stand, but I didn’t know that it would be this repugnant. Not only to potentially lie about Johnny raping her, but also to steal someone’s real life story to do it. As a survivor myself, I am deeply appalled and offended on every level.</p>
<p>Amber Heard is supposed to take the stand on Friday, if everything stays remotely on schedule. We’ll see then how low Amber has sunk in her crusade to vilify Johnny Depp. And how severely she’ll test my gag reflex.</p>

173,StarterPetitionUpdate,27285707,2020-07-14T17:09:04.000Z,,Poopgate Pictures,"<p>Malcolm Connolly was a security person for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. He was asked about several instances including the time on the honeymoon train, citing journal entries that accuse Johnny of beating her up, and never mind the fact that, yet again, she doesn’t have a mark on her. He, on the other hand, is sporting <a href=""https://buckwriter.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/12974294_539598889547092_1989485723801669839_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">a huge shiner</a>. Oh his honeymoom.</p>
<p>Moving on to the topic of Australia, QC tried to insinuate that, because of all the different stories that came out, that Amber didn’t chop off Johnny’s finger at all. Maybe Johnny did it himself on that accordion door, which Malcolm insisted is impossible because the door has a safety feature.</p>
<p>Queen’s Counsel, (QC) also insinuated that Johnny injured Amber despite the fact that she was searing a slip when Malcolm arrived first, and she didn’t have a mark on her. Scratches on her arms didn’t appear until after Jerry Judge, Johnny’s long-time head of security, showed up. In other words, those scratches were more likely than not self-inflicted.</p>
<p>When QC’s insinuations didn’t sway Malcolm to change his answers, she made it seem that Johnny was on drugs, as usual.</p>
<p>Redirect clarified that Malcolm simply never saw any injuries on Amber Heard. He, Malcolm, wouldn’t tolerate any man hitting a woman. Not Johnny Depp. Not even the Pope. On the other hand, Malcolm recounts being asked to intervene because Amber heard kept hitting Johnny repeatedly. Malcolm also assures the court that he has not been pressured in any way into testifying on Johnny Depp’s behalf.</p>
<p>Tara Roberts, (TR) is Johnny Depp’s Bahamian estate manager. QC started by insinuating that TR relies upon JD for her home and income, so she’d lie for him. TR insists that she’s got other family income. She’d be sad if she lost the job because of all the friends she’s made, but that she wouldn’t be financially devastated. She’s got no reason to lie to keep her job, and wouldn’t anyway.</p>
<p>QC tried to debunk TR’s statement that Johnny has never been violent toward people by showing that TMZ video. TR wouldn’t change her statement that Johnny isn’t violent or that Amber had no injuries on the island. So, unable to make any headway with her, QC let her off the hook.</p>
<p>Redirect cleared up that TR never saw Johnny hit or abuse Amber Heard or any other person. And that Amber never showed any injuries. But she did see Amber Heard being violent toward Johnny Depp, causing injuries including a gash across the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>No further questions.</p>
<p>Samantha MCmillen (SM) is Johnny Depp’s stylist since 2002, for 18 years now. She also worked as a stylist for Amber Heard while she and Johnny were together. SM confirmed what she’s been saying the whole time that when Amber Heard appeared on <a href=""https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/14/17/depp-court.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">the James Cordon show</a>, she displayed no injuries despite insisting that she had two black eyes.</p>
<p>Hilda Vargas (HV) has been Johnny Depp’s housekeeper for 30 years. She’s the one that found poop in Johnny Depp’s bed. QC tried to blame it on the dogs by saying that Depp’s dog Boo has a history of having accidents. HV clarified that the dogs have accidents “On the floor.” Both Pistol and Boo are too small to jump on the bed, and have never had an accident in the bed. She’s cleaned up after Boo many times, so she can say with authority that the poops were too big to have come from him. QC tried to suggest that Amber Heard was already gone for a full day at Coachella before the poop happened, but HV stuck to her story that Johnny was gone, and the poop was fresh. QC says that HV was angry, and HV admits that she felt disrespected to be left a mess like that because this sort of thing hasn’t happened 30 years of Working for Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Redirect clarified HV’s statements, and included that HV also saw Amber in May of 2016 without any injuries on her.</p>

175,StarterPetitionUpdate,27254148,2020-07-10T18:04:46.000Z,,Johnny Depp in Court: Day 4,"<p>Johnny seemed very confident today even though QC badgered him and called him a liar with every other breath and brought his dying mother into it. Really low blow.</p>
<p>QC tried to paint Johnny as a drug-addicted monster that walks around in a rage all the time. She failed miserably, because quite simply, that isn’t true.</p>
<p>QC went into that final night, the one where Amber insists that Johnny threw a cell phone at her face.</p>
<p>I’d like to interject here that if you haven’t seen Brian’s videos, be sure to check him out. He debunks her version of events with clear and concise logic that’s infallible. You can find him <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ/videos"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>They brought up our little petition in court today. It had been suggested that he had something to do with creating the petition back when Amber Heard was in AM1. Johnny said that the petition came “years later.” So take heart in knowing that he’s aware of us, my friends.</p>
<p>After a 5 (or so) session where testimony was given in chambers, David Sherborne (DS) redirected Johnny for an hour before the lunch break and an hour afterward.</p>
<p>DS asked about the people Johnny surrounds himself with. QC had painted them as yes men who wouldn’t interfere while He was slapping his wife around. DS gave Johnny a chance to testify that such is not true. His entourage wouldn’t stand idly by while such a thing happened, which was never a problem because it never happened.</p>
<p>The main difference between QC’s cross examination and DS’s redirect is that DS asked questions in a brief and concise manner. And he allowed Johnny to complete his answers instead of cutting him off, which QC did almost constantly. It was a very efficient way of conducting business. In two hours, DS debunked the accusations about Johnny’s violent nature that QC spent 3.5 days trying to construct.</p>
<p>Also debunked were the accusations that Johnny acquired massive amounts of drugs for only himself. Amber Heard’s medical records of the time showed that she had, indeed, ingested or otherwise used (abused?) drugs, including some that Johnny doesn’t even use.</p>
<p>After Johnny was let out of the hot seat, officer Melissa Saenz testified via video uplink. This is one of the officers that responded the night of that last, final fight of the marriage, the one where Amber insisted that Johnny threw a phone at her face and otherwise roughed her up.</p>
<p>QC tried to insist that OMS didn’t get a very good look at Amber’s face, and that there were injuries to Amber’s face that OMS missed, or didn’t see, or whatever. But OMS remained completely certain that she did get a very good look at Amber, and that there were no marks. There were no signs of violence whatsoever, on Amber or at the scene.</p>
<p>Like she did with Johnny, QC pulled the tactic of calling OMS a liar and interjecting her own scenario. But OMS weathered it brilliantly and refused to change her account of the evening.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what QC thought she was going to get away with, trying to call OMS a liar. OMS is a trained professional, an expert in domestic violence. But all she succeeded in doing was making herself look foolish.</p>
<p>That’s about all I caught from today. More as I hear about it.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I simply don’t see how Johnny can’t come out on top. Where the defense had nothing but “suggestions” and self-imposed testimony, the offense – Johnny’s team – has receipts for everything. Medical records and whatever else they need to prove their side of the case. I think it’s a slam dunk.</p>
<p>Next up: Probably updates about how Amber Heard is out until late/early every morning partying it up, seeming to take none of this seriously. And never mind Covid 19 in the crowds.</p>

176,StarterPetitionUpdate,27243789,2020-07-09T17:14:10.000Z,,Johnny Depp in court: Day Three,"<p>Day three saw more of the same badgering from the Sun’s counsel, who I’ll refer to as QC. Today, she addressed two incidents of what she called violence against Amber Heard at the hands of Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>First, QC talked about what happened in Australia when Johnny lost the tip of his finger. QC badgered Johnny with Amber’s ever-changing version of events. Now, Amber’s saying that she slept through the night and morning when Johnny chopped off his own finger and trashed the house – though she did make a statement in documents that she’s the one that broke the TV, belying her story that she woke up in the morning to find all this horror.</p>
<p>Johnny held his own, though, giving answers that were at times humorous and I daresay sassy. It was refreshing to see that he adamantly refuses to let Amber’s team get away with her fictional version of events.</p>
<p>It was rather horrifying, though, to see Johnny describe how the bone was sticking out of his devastated finger, and being so ruined himself that he did indeed write on the walls and mirrors in his own blood.</p>
<p>The judge and Johnny’s counsel were heard from a lot more today, objecting when QC stepped out of line, giving Johnny more of a chance to answer questions without being interrupted. Not that there were many questions. It was more like QC giving testimony and interrupting Johnny when he tried to answer to the fictional charges she was laying out.</p>
<p>QC also described the incident in the penthouse where Amber Heard said she hit Johnny for the first (and only?) time, in defense of her sister Whitney. Amber insists that Johnny was pushing Whitney around to try to get at Amber to abuse her. Johnny patently denied that version of events the same way he denies her version of all of these events.</p>
<p>As court wrapped up, it became known that Johnny’s lawyer will have an hour to redirect – to question Johnny again about certain points that QC addressed during her cross examination. I think that’s good. After being raked over the coals for three days, Johnny will get a chance to set the record straight.</p>
<p>On another amusing note, it seems that our little petition has been mentioned in court documents. See <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcerdEtWoAECbP0?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900"" rel=""nofollow"">the picture</a>. It seems that Amber Heard is bugged by our efforts. And to that, I say: GOOD. She needs to know that actions have consequences, and it’s not always consequences you can control. She seems to be the type that likes to be in control, but she can’t control the petition, and she will never control me.</p>

<p>But Johnny's having none of it. He won't admit to it because he never did it. He's never been violent with women and he's never been violent with Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The sun's counsel is leaning heavily on a fight on a plane wherein Amber Heard says that Johnny Kicked her, trying to get Johnny to say that if a man would kick a woman, doesn't that make him a wife-beater. Johnny's staying on top of it though, insisting that it didn't happen. And I guess Amber forgets that they weren't alone on the plane. There was a pilot, a stewardess, and two assistants. If any such kick took place, I'm sure it would have been in the headlines at the time.</p>
<p>Basically, the Sun's outta gas.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, the Sun was asking for more time to put Johnny on the stand, because, as she says, Johnny took too long answering questions and put her behind. It's a sneaky way of keeping Johnny in the hot seat and creating less time for the Sun and/or Amber Heard to have to explain themselves. I hope the judge sees right through it. </p>

180,StarterPetitionUpdate,27201212,2020-07-05T00:41:47.000Z,,Heard will be present when Johnny Depp testifies,"<p>Court has ruled that Amber Heard, Johnny Depp’s ex-wife, can be present in the courtroom when Johnny testifies. Johnny’s legal team tried to have her banned until or unless such a time as she might be called on to testify herself, but that bid was lost. That means that she can and likely will sit there watching Johnny Depp testify about why he’s not a wife-beater, and the Sun tabloid is guilty of libel by calling him such.</p>
<p>The case is planned to be heard in a UK court on Tuesday. NGN’s legal team failed to get the case thrown out of court earlier this week.</p>
<p>In UK criminal cases, witnesses cannot be present in court while others testify. However, they can be present in civil cases. Depp hoped to ban Heard by claiming her testimony would be influenced if she was present while he was cross-examined.</p>
<p>In a court order published today, Justice Nicol rejected that argument.</p>
<p>This is a classic abuser’s intimidation tactic, to stare down the victim as they testify, hoping to frighten or otherwise affect Johnny’s testimony. Maybe she thinks that he’ll see her baby greens and melt.</p>
<p>Me, I hope the judge sees this attempt at manipulation for what it is and calls her on it if she so much as blinks wrong at Johnny. It won’t make a difference in the Sun libel case, but any shenanigans she pulls can be carried directly to Depp’s defamation case in January, 2021.</p>

<p>Depp's team is asking for “communications” including, “any written or verbal exchanges between any person or persons or entities, including but not limited to verbal conversations, telephone calls, letters, e-mails, memoranda, reports, telegraphs, faxes, exhibits, drawings, text messages, and any other documents which confirm or related to the written or verbal exchange.""</p>
<p>Specifically, the subpoenas are asking for ""All documents that refer, reflect or relate to any donations made to YOU or for YOUR benefit by Ms. Heard, from January 1, 2016, through and including the present.""</p>
<p>According to Depp and Heard’s divorce settlement, that the actress would get $7 million from the actor as an equalization payment. As a caveat to the payment, it was agreed upon that the money would be donated to charity.</p>
<p>Heard had cited those two charities, the ACLU and Children’s hospital as the charities to which she would donate, and Johnny offered to send the money straight to those organizations. Heard, however, declined, saying that to do so would change and violate the terms of their divorce.</p>
<p>So now, Johnny wants to know where the money went.</p>

<p>In the same declaration, she said that Amber told her “many times” that Depp had abused his then wife. Now, Inglessis doesn’t want to testify to that fact. In fact, she doesn’t want to testify at all.</p>
<p>On May 16, Inglessis filed a motion in California federal court asking Magistrate Judge Patrick J. Walsh to quash his order compelling her give live testimony via a video feed. She also informed the court that she's received ""death threats and faced online harassment.” Inglessis also says her career as a celebrity makeup artist will suffer if she's forced to testify.</p>

But Heard’s fate has yet to be officially confirmed in a court of law.</p>
<p>For L’Oréal, though, Heard’s innocence or guilt shouldn't really be the issue. The suspicion should have been enough. After all, if a man were accused of half the things Amber Heard has done, he would have been sacked on the spot. The fact that Amber Heard continues to be a spokesperson for L’Oréal can only mean that the brand condones domestic violence and abusers. They are firmly in their corner.</p>
<p>A responsible company that cares about the rights of abused people would have immediately distanced themselves from Heard. At the least, they would have withdrawn her images from public circulation whilst they awaited the outcome of the trial.</p>
<p>Instead, L’Oréal has done exactly the opposite, posting images of Amber Heard over the weekend, praising her for her inner strength and beauty. To add insult to injury, the very next image they posted was a pair of pink boxing gloves, further teasing at their support of violent behavior.</p>
<p>The outrage on Twitter was immediate and definite. It’s a slap in the face to all domestic violence survivors, and quite a few people didn’t hesitate to say so.</p>
<p>A LOT of people have sworn to boycott L’Oréal and the companies it owns - including Maybelline, Garnier, and Lancôme. I’m one of those people. I won’t touch anything those companies make, from hair care to lipstick.  I’ll buy the 99 cent knockoffs at the dollar store first.</p>
<p>If L’Oréal continues to endorse a known abuser, they will find themselves on the wrong side of history. There’s no telling what damage they stand to suffer. For a beauty company, it certainly won’t be pretty. And they will have only themselves to blame.</p>

The chat itself isn’t much to write home about, just the two of them trash-talking Adam Waldman, Johnny’s lawyer, and crapping themselves about having to give depositions whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>What’s really interesting about this conversation, though, is that Amber Heard recorded it without Laura’s knowledge or consent (see photo). Normally that wouldn’t be a problem because so many states are one-party states, meaning that only one party in the conversation needs to give consent in order to record it. But <a href=""https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/california-recording-law"" rel=""nofollow"">California</a> is not a one-party state.

That’s pretty huge, as it shows Ms. Heard’s disregard for the law.</p>
<p>Court has also ruled that Heard’s former PA can testify. Mr. Justice Nicol declared that some, limited testimony from Kate James, a former personal assistant to Heard, will be included in the forthcoming trial. Specifically, Kate never saw any bodily injuries on Amber Heard’s body or face.</p>
<p>Likewise, Mr. Justice Nicol will admit testimony from Vanessa Paradis, Johnny Depp’s partner of 14 years and the mother of his two children. Vanessa has written letters of support for Johnny and has been vocal about the fact that Johnny is kind and gentle, and has never been abusive toward her</p>
<p>Winona Ryder’s, Johnny’s past girlfriend, will also testify that Johnny was never abusive towards her in any way. In her statement, Ryder said: “I cannot wrap my head around [Heard’s] accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He [Depp] was never, never abusive at all towards me.”</p>
<p>Heard was not happy about the ruling. A spokeswoman for Heard said: “As the judgment today shows, Mr. Depp’s team has been attempting to introduce irrelevant evidence. This is one of the defining characteristics of their strategy – to adduce irrelevant evidence designed to smear Ms. Heard and distract from the facts so that people do not focus on Mr. Depp’s behaviour.”</p>
<p>In other words, she’s all butthurt that his past girlfriends get to say what a nice guy he is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, testimony from David Killackey, Johnny Depp’s mechanic, was ruled irrelevant and will not be admitted. If you remember, Killackey was witness to threats from both Amber Heard and her father, as well as being sexually harassed by Heard herself.</p>
<p>We need to keep in mind that this is ONLY Johnny’s libel case against the Sun. ONLY about whether Johnny was abusive toward Amber Heard, not about her being abusive to him. Evidence that may be irrelevant to the libel case in the UK will probably be admissible in Johnny’s Defamation case in VA. We’ll most likely heard from Mr. Killackey then.</p>

<p>Lately, Amber Heard’s team has been accusing Johnny of abusing his past girlfriends, trying desperately to establish a pattern of abuse by Johnny.</p>
<p>That’s blown up in her face repeatedly, because those past girlfriends have shown up every time <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/winona-ryder-and-vanessa-paradis-defend-johnny-depp-he-was-never-never-violent"" rel=""nofollow"">to defend him</a>, saying that he’s a kind and gentle and was never violent with them.</p>
<p>Amber heard, on the other hand, has a long and storied history of showing violent tendencies with multiple people. She was arrested in 2009 and 9 for <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/07/amber-heard-arrested-2009-charge-hitting-girlfriend/85563338/"" rel=""nofollow"">assaulting her wife</a> Tasya Van Ree. Stories are still coming out about other women stepping forward to say that she also abused them.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present and Amber’s current trials and tribulations. The stories about injuries she reportedly inflicted upon Johnny Depp – in her own words caught on tape – have been pretty well documented. I’m not here to recount all of them. I’d be here all day. Suffice it to say that she tortured him and nearly killed him on several occasions.</p>
<p>It does bear mentioning that it's not just Johnny that was affected by Heard's actions. His children were often in the house during these incidents and witnessed the immediate aftermath.</p>
<p>And there have been other victims of Amber’s wrath. Kate James, Heard’s former personal assistant, has come forward with horrifying and heartbreaking stories <a href=""https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-amber-heard-abuse-assistant-kate-james-lawsuit-drugs-mental-verbal-trial"" rel=""nofollow"">of the way she was treated</a> at Amber Heard’s hands.</p>
<p>”Amber was regularly verbally and mentally abusive and would often scream at me in that way, over the smallest things. She would fly into blind rages where no-one could reason with her, and even if I was trying to offer an explanation, I didn’t think that she could hear me as she was so angry. It was like she thought regular things that can go wrong in any person’s life on any given day didn’t apply to her. Everything that went wrong was always my fault. I remember one occasion where she missed a connection on a flight on or around Christmas Day in 2012. My aunt was visiting from Australia at that time. She was screaming abuse at me for literally hours as though I had made it snow and caused the disruptions to the flight.”</p>
<p>One time, Amber Heard took James’ <a href=""https://twitter.com/winonasrider/status/1237872412080795649?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">4 year old son</a> to use as a human prop in a photo shoot. If I recall correctly, Heard drove with the tiny toddler in the front seat without any restraint. Jame’s was horrified and couldn’t get her son away from Heard fast enough.</p>
<p>Then there’s <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7743993/Amber-Heards-father-threatened-SHOOT-Johnny-Depp-witness-testifies-actors-defamation-suit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">David Killackey</a>, who was reportedly threatened and sexually harassed by Amber Heard. David, who worked on both Heard and Depp's classic cars, claimed that Heard was abusive toward him and that her father, David Heard, made 'death threats' toward Depp in a phone call. Killackey said the abuse began after he told Heard that all work on the cars would have to be paid directly, rather than through Depp's management. “The reply I received was to verbally abuse me with expletives, threats and a continued rant over what she claimed was an unfortunate financial downturn of her personal finances caused by Mr. Depp. At one point she said ""you motherf***er, you're screwing me!""</p>
<p>Another time, Heard asked Killackey to show her something in her car. Then, when they were both inside, Heard said suggestively that they were alone down there and that “anything could happen.” Killackey immediately exited the vehicle, spurning her advances, and that she became unpleasant after that.</p>
<p>Killackey said that he stopped communicating with Heard directly after a 'very unpleasant' call, and soon began to hear from her father instead. During one phone call about the repairs, David Heard allegedly told Killackey: 'That f***ing piece of s*** is f***ing me too because I'm supposed to get 10 percent of the money and without it I can't produce the movie I was gunna make!” David Heard went on to say: 'When I get to him I'm going to beat the s*** out of him' and 'I'm from Texas, and men from Texas carry 45's and Johnny is going to meet the f***ing end of mine!' Killackey claimed.  </p>
<p>Killackey reported the threats to the police.</p>
<p>Apparently, that apple didn’t fall far from the tree.</p>
<p>The point, here, is that it’s Amber Heard is the one that has a history of abusive behavior, not Johnny Depp. No matter how much smoke and mirrors she throws up to make it look like Johnny is the one who was violent, there is simply no getting away from the history of her own actions. And, soon enough, she’ll end up paying for them. He tacky little web is falling apart around her, and she’s got nowhere left to hide.</p>

<p>Everybody in Hollywood might know for a fact that she won’t be returning as Mera in Aquaman 2. She might already know it herself. So could we. We could know that she’s already been dealt out of the movie and blacklisted from the DC universe, and blackballed in Hollywood, but might be waiting for “official” confirmation before we let ourselves believe it.</p>
<p>But that’s not always the way it goes in Hollywood. We might never get “official” confirmation. It’s entirely possible that the only confirmation we actually get is when they film and release the film without her in it.</p>
<p>I hear some Amber Stan in the back screaming: “But she has a contract! You’re stupid!” And that maybe true, on both counts. But consider this. Actors can be bought out of their contracts the same way athletes can, and for a variety of reasons. Remember when Robert Downey Junior couldn’t be insured because of his drug use? Didn’t the same thing happen to Linsey Lohan? That could be why. Or there could be a heinous breach of the contract’s morals clause. Could be she was just a nightmare to work with and they were looking for a reason to dump her.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>RDJ was able to regroup and make the world's best comeback, thanks to the friends he has in the industry, and I'm glad.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there’s every reason to believe that Amber Heard won’t be back in Aquaman 2. I don’t know if they’ll replace her as Mera, or if they’ll just write the character out and get Momoa a new love interest. Either way, the movie will be better for it. I, personally, look forward to enjoying it without her in it.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is a lot of fans already believe that Amber Heard is out. You may not, and that’s fine. But don’t hold your breath for “official” confirmation. It may not come. But when AM2 comes out without her, we’ll all be celebrating just the same.</p>

<p>The reporter’s name is Rachel Abrams. In addition to the Times, she’s written pieces for Variety and other publications that favor Amber and Elon Musk, as well as others. I didn’t know that when I talked to her. I thought I was helping to get the petition some attention with a piece in the New York Times. I’m sure she was counting on that. And, sadly, she got it.</p>
<p>She asked me about why I started the petition. I told her that I started the petition because I was sick of the inequality in Hollywood. If a man were accused of half the things that Amber reportedly did, he would have been sacked on the spot. And, in fact, he was. Johnny got canned because of Amber’s WaPo op-ed.</p>
<p>She asked me if any famous names have signed. I said that I saw the name Nic Cage scroll by, but that there’s no way of knowing if that was the real Nicolas Cage showing support for his friend or if somebody was just using that name. No way to tell.</p>
<p>She asked for a list of people who have signed this petition, but don’t worry, kids. She did not get it. Under no circumstances would I serve you guys up that way. You’re safe with me.</p>
<p>She asked if I've talked to Adam Waldman. I told her that I have not.</p>
<p>She asked where I got my information for my updates, and I named several sources, like the Blast. I’m sorry to say that I also named Brian McPherson, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ThatBrianFella"" rel=""nofollow"">ThatBrianFella</a> on Twitter and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ"" rel=""nofollow"">Incredibly Average</a> on Youtube. He truly is the best source for information, the way he scours every source available and reports on it objectively. I stressed that several times, his objectivity. It’s easy to lean in Johnny Depp’s favor when all the shady stuff is on Amber’s side, but Brian sticks to objectivity. That’s what makes him such a reliable source.</p>
<p>I was an idiot. I chatted away, thinking everything was on the up and up. And I hope they were. But there’s the very real possibility that I was just fodder for a hit piece she and her team are working on to make Johnny Depp and his fans look stupid, and I walked right into it.</p>
<p>Watch for her piece, folks. Only time will tell what spin she had in mind when she got me on the phone.</p>
<p>If she was legitimately interested in the petition, as she seemed, I hope she writes a piece that brings some attention to the inequality of cause and effect within Hollywood.</p>

202,StarterPetitionUpdate,26568574,2020-05-06T19:30:09.000Z,,Elon Musk melts down on Twitter.,"<p>Following the birth of his latest son - I'd provide his name, but frankly, I can't understand it - Elon musk jumped on twitter to criticize UK coronavirus advisor Neil Ferguson, who just stepped down from his government post after getting caught breaking quarantine rules for a tryst with a married woman.</p>
<p>""What a tool,"" Musk wrote while retweeting an article about Ferguson's public indiscretion.</p>
<p>Depp fans were quick to point out Musk's indiscretions with Amber Heard just one month after she married Johnny Depp. </p>
<p>Musk adamantly denies he was involved in any love triangle, and reaffirmed his stance on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of the images released of video footage showing Musk in the elevator going up to Depp's penthouse with Heard, Musk said: ""This is false. JD’s team put out 'video evidence', but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated.""</p>
<p>A die-hard Johnny Depp fan continued to lay into Musk and did not let him off the hook for the denial.</p>
<p>""The building staff testified under oath they let you in the building while Johnny was filming in Australia. Amber asked them to get you a fob so you had freedom to come and go. Security saw you multiple times while they were married,"" the person wrote to Musk.</p>
<p>Musk once again claimed that whoever gave a deposition was not telling the truth, and wrote:</p>
<p>""This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?""</p>
<p>“Cuck” is a concept borne out of insecurity: a fear that one is inadequate, sexually or otherwise, and that inadequacy will lead to the loss of the things that are important to him. ... Those who call others a cuck do so in the desperate hope that shreds of their own masculine and racial prominence can be protected.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk is taking pot shots at Johnny's masculinity, saying Johnny wasn't enough of a man for Amber, and that he himself was. The use of that word speaks volumes about Musk's own insecurities, though, rather than his intended insult toward Depp.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp isn't ""Cucked."" He's more than adequate as a man and as a human being. Otherwise, he wouldn't be such a target for a toxic narcissist who tried to take advantage of him, ruin him, and possibly even kill him. </p>
<p>Seems to me that Musk should have better things to do with his time these days, like basking in the glory of being a new father.</p>
<p>But that's just me.</p>

Listen to 911 call made the night Johnny Depp and Amber Heard had blowout fight that ended their toxic 18-month marriage - but both claim tape backs up their version of events.</p>
<p>'Hi, I need to report an assault right now happening at 849 Broadway at the Eastern building,' the caller says, referring to the couple's home in LA. The recording was buried in legal files for nearly four years and it raises tantalizing new questions about the former couple's infamous clash around the time. Timestamped 8:27pm on May 21, 2016, the call appears to have been made when Heard claims Depp hurled a cell phone at her face and tore out her hair.</p>
<p>Refusing to give a name, the caller explains that a friend named Amber is being attacked by a man described merely as a 'boyfriend', saying: 'I happen to know that it's happening and I just need to remain anonymous. Physically assaulting her, yeah,' replies the caller, becoming agitated. 'Send somebody up there please,' the caller adds, reiterating the location of the couple's lavish penthouse before the recording abruptly ends. </p>
<p>Heard's attorney says phone records and police department logs vindicate Heard’s account of the final shocking episode of domestic violence she endured before filing for divorce.</p>
<p>Depp’s legal team say this recording does the precise opposite, however, by raising discrepancies in the various accounts Heard and her allies have given of the notorious dust up.  </p>
<p>His attorney is also questioning the identity of the caller, pointing out the female voice on the clip does not belong to iO Tillett Wright. They suggest the 8:27pm 911 call was instead placed by Heard's buddy Raquel Pennington.</p>
<p>iO Tillett Wright's famous call was not registered on the 911 system until 10:09pm, around an hour and a half after the alleged attack. Johnny's team insists that the timing discrepancies support his version of events that night.</p>

<p>We already suspected as much because with such traumatic injuries comes swelling, and she had none. Not to mention the fact that her bruises moved from one day to the next, whenever it was necessary to paint them on for show.</p>
<p>In 2019 Amber Heard’s personal stylist, Samantha McMillen, went on record stating that she believes that her black eyes were fake, saying that: “On December 16, 2015, I spent much of the day and evening with Amber Heard, preparing her to appear on the James Corden show. I saw her throughout the day of December 16, 2015, in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup. Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body. She appeared as a guest on the James Corden show that day.”</p>
<p>There you have it.</p>
<p>In the state of California, a person who is found to have falsified evidence  can be convicted of a felony under California Penal Code sections 132 or 134 for a maximum sentence of 3 years. </p>
<p>The question is whether or not she'd do any time at all, even if convicted. So far, she's gotten away with a boatload of offences, including beating her husband, without seeing the inside of a jail cell. </p>
<p>This isn't the first time she has submitted falsified documents or has been faced with jail time. In 2016 Heard plead guilty for supplying falsified documents when she smuggled her two dogs into Australia. And she got out of any real punishment for that. </p>

They're outraged that WB and DC are completely ignoring the fact that Amber Heard has been PROVEN to be a serial abuser, and ignoring the petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of paying fans to remove Amber Heard from AM2. How dare they confirm her for a return to the role of Mera. </p>
<p>But did they? </p>
<p>Everything I've read, including those statements confirming the official dates for the movie's release. And ALL  of them use language like ""The cast is EXPECTED to return."" or ""Amber heard is SET to return.""</p>
<p>Expected. Set. Prepared. Ready.</p>
<p>Nowhere does it say that Amber Heard is CONFIRMED to return. </p>
<p>I'm sure she wants to. She's certainly going to need the money to pay of Johnny Depp when he wins his 50 million dollar defamation suit against her. And she seems the type to NEED the fame that comes with stardom.</p>
<p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves. There are two law suits standing between Amber Heard and that role. Johnny's libel suit against the sun and his defamation case against Heard herself. If she's found in the wrong in either one of them, then she's got a lot to lose. </p>
<p>There's a morals clause in every contract in Hollywood these days. And if Heard loses in either one of those cases, the studio can, and probably will, fire her due to that morals clause. </p>
<p>Let's not forget that the filming and release date for AM2 was pushed back when these suits were filed, probably for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>WB DC aren't ignoring us. They're covering their collective asses. If they fire her just because of a petition, they open themselves up for a HUGE wrongful termination suit from Heard. </p>
<p>By waiting for the outcome of these cases, WB DC are giving themselves a valid reason to fire her. If she's fired for a morals clause violation, she can't sue them for wrongful termination. </p>
<p>Stay calm, folks. It's not over until it's over. Filming hasn't even started. Let's wait and see what happens with these law suits before we throw our outrage around. We know she's going to lose.

The question I have is WHY? As I understand it, she doesn't have to. Has she been subpoenaed? </p>
<p>There are only two reasons I can think of that she would show up uninvited and pitch her two cents into the ring. </p>
<p>First, a toxic narcissist will to anything to try to save face. and they're masters of playing the victim. Amber Heard would likely jump at any chance to vilify Johnny and paint herself as the poor, terrorized victim of his unbearable abuse.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think she's going to talk about those texts that Johnny wrote to Paul Bettany. You know, the ones where Johnny talked about burning and drowning Amber, then fucking her dead corpse to make sure she's dead. Anybody with half a brain knows that abuse victims often fantasize that their abuser would die so that the abuse could stop. Johnny was venting to his friend about his abuser. He would never do such a thing. He said so in the very same text.</p>
<p>But Amber's likely won't play it that way. I'm willing to bet real money that she's going to show up and use that text to portray herself as a victim who was afraid for her very life. ""He was planning to KILL me!"" She'll probably testify, dabbing at the corner of her eye with a tissue. </p>
<p>Her testimony will have no bearing on the Sun case, because nothing can change the fact that Amber is the one who abused Johnny. No. What she's doing is setting up her testimony so that it will be a matter of record, so that she can use it in Johnny's defamation suit against her.</p>
<p>She plays the long game, let's not forget. She took ""damning"" photos and set herself up as the victim for probably the entirety of their relationship, knowing what she was ultimately going to do. I wouldn't doubt that the same thing is going on here.</p>
<p>The other reason the I can think of for her to show up and testify is to try to rattle Johnny, who will most likely be there. It's possible that she wants him to see her and fall to pieces, lose his resolve, or make a mistake and say something stupid.</p>
<p>Think about how crazy stupid in love with her he was. Is that really gone from within him? Or does he still have a soft spot for his ""made up"" ex wife? Could he see her, go all mushy and drop the defamation case?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Four years is a long time, and a lot of things can happen. One of those things is that Johnny has recovered himself. He's gotten back who he is, and he's steeled his resolve to defend himself against allegations that just aren't true. Seeing her isn't going to make him lose that. If anything, seeing her will strengthen his resolve.</p>

She's a tiny gem of a good human. #Prouduncle #weareyou</p>
<p>Lily Rose handled it with grace and dignity, but I can only imagine the pain of betrayal at the hands of somebody who her family had taken in as one of their own. </p>
<p>Then came iO's complicity in buddy Amber Heard's scheme to ruin Johnny depp - which failed miserably and backfired squarely in her face. </p>
<p>Next, iO claimed that Johnny Depp was fired from Pirates because he missed a month of filming. That would be the month that Johnny was recuperating from Amber cutting off part of his finger, and poor Johnny contracting MRSA three times, nearly dying. </p>
<p>Fact is that Johnny was dumped from Pirates one week after Heard's WaMo op-ed in which she obviously refers to being a victim of Johnny Depp's (nonexistent) abuse.</p>
<p>Over and over again, iO chooses to stab Johnny and his family squarely in the back, even though Johnny took iO into his home when he (iO) had nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>I have to wonder what life will be like for iO when his complicity in Heard's scams blow up in his face, stripping away from him any credibility he might have amassed as an author and artist. I can't imagine his future will be too bright. Once Amber Heard no longer needs him to try and bolster her losing case, iO will be dumped like everybody else that no longer serves her purpose.

<p>This latest fishing trip is Heard's most desperate attempt yet to smear Johnny Depp by associating him with Weinstein, Hollywood's biggest pariah. If she can smear enough mud on Johnny, she thinks, I guess, that she can get a pass for abusing him.</p>
<p>There is a link between Johnny Depp and Harvey Weinstein, of course. The 2004 movie, 'The Libertine.' The film was promoted by the Weinstein Company. As such, there's no guarantee that the owner of the post-production promotion company ever passed words with Johnny Depp, and there's certainly no proof whatsoever that Johnny had any knowledge whatsoever of Weinstein's misdeeds. </p>

She says that she couldn't possibly have abused him because she's never been able to overpower him or knock him down. The judge and jury will never believe him, she asserts. </p>
<p>In the same conversation, Heard lays out her dastardly plan, taunting him about having her hair and makeup done to take pictures of her alleged abuse over time, so that the time stamps would match up with her allegations. It's obvious that she's been planning his demise for a very long time. Unfortunately for her, she can't keep her mouth shut and her own words give her away. </p>
<p>Johnny Depp replies </p>
<p>You can read a very telling transcript HERE.</p>
<p>Johnny finally seems to understand what's been going on for the entirety of their marriage, that he's being set up to take a fall. He tells her, sadly, ""I've loved you for so many f**king years but you know what? You didn't exist. You don't exist. You're not there. You're a f**king made up thing in my head. And I can't believe you're doing this to me."" </p>
<p>Incredibly, Heard's lawyers hold up this latest audio recording as proof the Johnny was the abuser, despite Heard's admissions. </p>
<p>Johnny's lawyers say simply that this is a conversation any abuse victim will recognize. Her saying ""No one will believe you, so you better do what I want."" </p>

If she'd been around Hollywood's A-list for more than ten minutes, she'd know that public opinion is a fickle, fickle thing. One minute, you're the darling of the media. The next, the whole world knows that you're a monster and nobody minds calling you out on it.</p>
<p>She'll have to get used to that. When Johnny wins his defamation case, she's not going to have anywhere to hide, no matter how many times she shows off her nipples. Little boys will oggle the view, but grownups will shun her for the monster she is. Hopefully, her only employment options will be the fabulous world of fast food, or porn. nothing in mainstream entertainment.</p>
<p>She'll also have to get used to being about 50 million dollars lighter. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Amber's 'only' worth about 9 million. If/when the verdict for that case swings in Johnny's favor, she'd going to have to start asking all her friends for loans to cover it. And I think she'll find herself in a very lonely place. </p>

<p>Thanks to Amber Heard's manipulation of the #MeToo movement and accusations that Johnny Depp was a domestic abuser, a lot of people 'canceled' him. They were quick to believe Heard amid the #MeToo media storm that was felling giants around us. </p>
<p>But then Depp produced photos of himself with a bruised face and a nearly severed finger, accusing Amber Heard of being the ""perpetrator of domestic abuse, not the victim."" </p>
<p>Fans the world over have flocked back to Johnny Depp's side, eating their words and seeking atonement for being so quick to believe the accusations against him. </p>
<p>By making herself the darling of the #MeToo movement, Heard made it even harder for real victims of abuse to come forward. If one woman can lie about being abused, all claims of domestic abuse can now be viewed with doubt. Heard has not supported victims of domestic abuse, she has done them a huge disservice.</p>
<p>Heard's ""evidence"" against Depp was wan and dubious, while his proof seems insurmountable. The verdict isn't in yet, but the tide of public opinion is just about unanimous, in favor of Depp.</p>

There have been many new questions that have made Amber stumble with her words. </p>,,,,justice-for-johnny-depp-ebc1663b-788f-448e-b681-761b4488fa61,,against
1,StarterPetitionUpdate,30580344,2022-05-22T21:27:41.000Z,,Case Update,"<p>Johnny Depp's new lawyer, Camille Vasquez, has started to cross examine Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The Orange County-based attorney is representing Depp in his $50 million defamation suit against his ex-wife Amber Heard over a 2018 op-ed she penned for The Washington Post insinuating she was a survivor of domestic abuse. Though not mentioned by name in the op-ed, Depp accused Heard of costing him acting roles and tarnishing his reputation in the entertainment industry. Heard is countersuing for $100 million. </p>
<p>At one point of the cross-examination, Vasquez asked Heard about the $7 million divorce settlement she received in October 2018 following her split from Depp, which Heard pledged to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Upon this questioning, Amber Heard seemed to try and get away from denying that she DONATED it. Also, as part of the cross examination, Camille questioned Amber about an incident that happened while Amber and Johnny were in Australia. Vasquez asked Heard about her statement saying that Johnny Depp assaulted her whilst pinning her down into a counter and proceeded to hit her with a bottle. The questions Vasquez asked what when did Johnny grab the bottle, before of after? But all Amber claimed was that he had the bottle in his hand while he was hitting her with it. This question was repeated about five times with the same answers. We will see what the next week brings. </p>

The WB firing him only weighed down even more on his mental health after being made to feel not believed, not listened to, unable to defend himself  and also useless and ""washed off"" in his career. As you might have read, Amber has repeatedly spat these words in his face ""you're old, you're  fat, you're  washed off and your career is over. You'll die a lonely old man"". The fact that he loved her alot made these words pierce in his soul and self esteem.  This is psichological haressment. So imagine being Johnny, sliding towards depression and uncertainty about your person and career and then WB coming  and firing you. WB are actually guilty of teaming up with the abuser and adding up to the abuse! So please if you care, share share share this a thousand times and make it become viral!!!

2,StarterPetitionUpdate,28100761,2020-11-21T05:34:31.000Z,,We Will Not Be Silenced,"<p>Hello Friends!</p>
<p>I feel that now is a good time for an update.</p>
<p>Recently, the comments section on this petition, and the Aquaman petition against Amber Heard have had their comments section removed without notice. All old comments have been deleted, and no new comments are allowed to be made. The petitions have also been removed from the website’s search engine.</p>
<p>I want to take this time to really clear the air here:<br>What is the purpose of these petitions? <br>In my opinion, I personally don’t feel that Ms Heard should be in a position to be a spokesperson or deemed a role model for young women. She really shouldn’t be a spokesperson or role model for anyone.</p>
<p>But the bottom line, the reason we are fighting this so hard, is for equality. </p>
<p>Yes, many who have started these petitions has a love for Johnny Depp. I will not deny that. But to me? If this had been any other celebrity couple, I would still have created a petition.</p>
<p>Why?<br>For equality, and justice.<br>Domestic violence and abuse has no gender.</p>
<p>As a woman, it is hard enough to have the guts to come forward and admit that there has been abuse in your relationship.</p>
<p>I’m a domestic violence survivor.</p>
<p>I know how hard it is. I also know how hard it is to push through the emotional and mental trauma that comes with abuse. <br>I know how hard it can be to have to tell people what you’ve experienced, and then having to deal the ridicule and backlash that you can receive after telling your story.<br>And the reality is: most days you don’t want to fight it. You don’t want you have to continue to tell your story to countless people. You just want to bury your head and have it all just go away.</p>
<p>Most days you don’t the emotional, mental or even physical strength to think about it.</p>
<p>I’ve lived through it. I know all too well how hard the battle is.</p>
<p>But, I have a certain amount of privilege. I can sit here and say I was abused and it is more believable. <br>Why? <br>Because I am a woman. <br>Society has forced stereotypes on us. It has made it harder for men to be vulnerable enough to share their experiences with abuse. Then when men do find the courage to speak up and talk about their abuse, they are usually not believed, or they are laughed at for not being “tough enough”. And when there is a woman sitting there, contradicting what he is saying; saying that he’s wrong, and he was the abuser, and he’s lying...<br>Well, that’s called gaslighting.</p>
<p>It takes a brave soul to come forward and truthfully talk about their most private and intimate details about their personal life. Johnny Depp did this. He got on the stand and told the world, and he was not believed.</p>
<p>Now, I am not saying I know all the details about what went on in their marriage.<br>I do know this though:<br>I’ve read through enough information from the court case in London. I’ve heard enough of Amber Heard’s recorded ramblings, and heard enough testimony from Johnny Depp and his team to see the similarities between what I experienced, and what really happened between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The blame game, the deflection, stealing of stories, blatant lies, admission of physical abuse, with a sprinkle of gaslighting. This is the abuser.</p>
<p>The deflection of admission abuse occurred, the hiding, the covering up, not sharing with anyone unless they see it first hand. Covering up to save face, to “protect” the abuser. This is the abused.</p>
<p>What we are after here is equality.<br>If Johnny Depp is accused and loses his spokesperson gigs, his movie roles, then the same should go for Amber Heard. </p>
<p>If as a woman, I want to be treated equally, then that comes with the good and the bad. <br>If I want to be treated equally, then that means I have to agree to see men as my equal in all situations.</p>
<p>We are at risk of losing our voice here.<br>We need to be heard. <br>We need to be seen. <br>We need people to take their hands out of their pockets and see the big picture. </p>
<p>1 in 4 women. </p>
<p>1 in 7 men. </p>
<p>Those numbers don’t lie. </p>
<p>This isn’t just a fight of Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard. <br>Maybe that’s how it started. But now:<br>This is a fight about the abused vs. the abuser. <br>This is a fight to have people do what’s right, to open their eyes and realize abuse has no gender.</p>
<p>Continue to share the link of these petitions. Continue to get our voice out there.<br>We are not going to give up the fight to see this through.<br>We will continue to demand justice.</p>
<p>We are not going to go down quietly.</p>",,,,l-oréal-remove-amber-heard-as-l-oreal-spokesperson,,against

If you don't know who she is, she is the creator of the ""Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2"" petition that is here on change.org: (<a href=""https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2</a> <br>If you haven't signed her petition, go do it now. She's almost at 500,000 signatures, and constantly growing. </p>
<p>Let's get real for a second, the testimony provided by Heard and various witnesses is confusing, full of holes, and constantly changed while on the stand. I'm really don't think she could even keep track of what she was saying. The contradictions were endless. Is this really someone we want our children to look up to? Is this really a woman that we want representing survivors of abuse? In my humble opinion: absolutely not. </p>
<p>I fully believe in innocent until proven guilty. But reading the court transcripts, the tweets, and the updates of the case of JD against The Sun, her testimony seems to be that of fiction rather than truth. </p>
<p>We can't stop now. As someone who believes that all people should be treated equally, it really comes down to this: if we as females want equality, then it needs to come with both the good and the bad. That means, regardless of gender, religion, skin, orientation, if you are accused of doing something wrong, then you should be treated, and have the same repercussions as everyone else, just as much as you should be praised for doing the right thing. If it's okay to cancel contracts, remove endorsements, sever ties, and run a man's name through the mud, for things he ""allegedly"" did, then why is this woman being spared? </p>
<p>Get the word out friends:</p>
<p>L'Oréal, it's time to step up and take action for what's really going on. Pull the commercials. Pull the signage. Stop the social media posts. </p>
<p>Let's do the right thing. Spread the word. </p>","{'id': '224407561', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/0/ac/cx/moacCxcqHBfEHuU-800x450-noPad.jpg?1596824652', 'processing': False}}",,,l-oréal-remove-amber-heard-as-l-oreal-spokesperson,,against

<p>I am posting this new update because Amber Heard just got signed to a new contract with L'Oréal Paris and that literally makes no sense. This woman should not be gaining any new contracts until she pays for what she has done to Depp.</p>
<p>I created a new petition as well to have her removed from that L'Oréal contract. Please take time to go check it out and sign that petition so that we can continue as a whole to bring justice to Depp in any way that we can.</p>
<p>Please don’t stop sharing, and don’t give up on Depp!</p>

Now the justice doesn’t stop there, he deserves justice from The Sun, he deserves justice from he ACLU, who are STILL trying to do him over and last but certainly not least I strongly believe Amber Heard and her “friends” are trialed for Perjury! Together we can make a difference and make our voices heard and in the name of justice. ��❤️‍���</p>
<p>Please note whilst I am a firm believer in the truth and in justice, I IN NO WAY WHAT SO EVER CONDONE ANY THREATENING BEHAVIOUR ETC to Amber Heard. Justice needs to be served yes but in the right way and there is also a little innocent child in the middle of all this who hasn’t a clue what’s going on and doesn’t deserve any of this. Also as unfit AH may be, that child needs He/she’s mother plus careful safety intervention from professionals, more so with no dad involved. Thank you. </p>",,,,the-sun-newspaper-to-apologise-to-johnny-depp,,against

<p>Do you know what this will mean?  That this will force Johnny to relive all of the horrors of when he had to live through that horrific time of being married to that banshee of a horrible creature  all over again and that ridiculous trial again that he should have never had to go through to begin with, that he will have to 'hear her story'  that we will ALL have to hear 'her story' again.  We cannot let this happen again.</p>
<p>We must all gather our friends, and make WARNER BROTHERS, JASON MOMOA, AND THAT DIRECTOR realize that this disease A.Heard does not need to be in the movie to survive.  There are many MANY other much more talented actresses out there that can and will be willing to fill the shoes of Queen Mera.  Even Bill Campbell has been said to toss the script his way!</p>
<p>How would it look to Warner Bros. if the movie sunk due to them not listening to all of us?  Maybe then they will wish they had listened and kick her to the curb once and for all.  Its not right for her to get away with what she did.  Help get justice for Johnny.  Warner Bros kicked him to the curb based on the LIES A.H. said about him anyway..........so she needs to lose out as well!</p>","{'id': '226705783', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/7/ry/qw/oBrYqWAplFIMwEC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1655918607', 'processing': False}}",,,remove-husband-abuser-proven-liar-from-aquaman-movies-boycott-aquaman,,against

<p>Contact NCFM Women Against False Accusations, Lori Debolt – <a href=""tel:(630)%20882-%209527"" rel=""nofollow"">(630) 882- 9527</a>, lori@ncfm-women.org; or Steven Svoboda, NCFM PR Director, at <a href=""tel:(510)-8275-771"" rel=""nofollow"">(510)-8275-771</a>, arc@arclaw.org</p>
<p><br><strong><em>Amber Heard Behind Closed Doors</em></strong><br><strong><em>Malicious false accusers need to be held criminally accountable and go to jail.</em></strong></p>
<p><br>Celebrities Johnny Depp, mega-mogul Elon Musk, US Senator Al Franken, golfer Tiger Woods, comedian Christopher Titus, model Lewis Burton, baseball players Chuck Finley and John Bobbitt, along with tens of thousands of other men suffer from female accusations. </p>
<p>Absent any proof or evidence, any woman can point an accusatory finger at any man and do extraordinary damage to his career, reputation, family, finances and future. Such women can cause imprisonment and even suicide of their targets.</p>
<p>Given the incitement to “#BelieveWomen,” all women wield that weapon, and all men are vulnerable to it.</p>
<p>All men are not bad and all women are not good; and, the notion that all women are powerless victims is phantastic.</p>
<p>Proof of women’s power (and not always benevolent intentions) is clearly demonstrated in Amber Heard’s ill-treatment of Johnny Depp. And, if you're not a rich and powerful man like Johnny Depp you don't stand a chance against such cruel accusations.</p>
<p>Similarly, guilty or not, it appears a politically motivated third party with no firsthand knowledge of an alleged incident of sexual impropriety wagged a dirty finger at Musk, who may have been extorted.<br>   <br><strong>We need prosecutors with the courage to charge and indict malicious false accusers, all of whom need to be held accountable and suffer serious consequences, just like their victims.</strong><br><br>We need more Johnny Depp/Amber Heard like scandals televised for all to see. No longer a he said, she said without proof and evidence. But, an opportunity to see behind closed doors and sort fact from fiction in pursuit of truth and justice.</p>
<p>Malicious false accusers need to be held criminally accountable and go to jail. If Amber Heard maliciously accused Johnny Depp, will she soon be behind bars? If so, we know of some proverbial high and dry land in Florida in which you might be interested.</p>
<p>Over a year ago, as a counter measure to such hurtful accusations, NCFM started our chapter Women Against False Accusations.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp has asked a judge to throw out Amber Heard’s request for a new trial, after his ex-wife claimed that a fake juror sat in on their high-stakes defamation case.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the Pirates of the Caribbean star, who was awarded $10m in damages by the jury of seven, filed new court documents on Monday saying that Ms Heard’s motion to call for a mistrial was “untimely”, that she had access to the purported new “facts” months ago and that she has failed to cite any unfair prejudice.</p>
<p>Mr Depp’s legal team argues that – even if the juror mix-up is correct – the individual who sat on the panel and sided with him in the case was still vetted by the court.</p>
<p>“Even if Ms Heard had filed her Supplemental Memorandum in a timely manner – which she did not – or even had she not waived her right to raise this alleged issue by sitting on the information for more than two months – which she did – the court should still grant Plaintiff’s mption to strike Defendant’s Supplemental Memorandum because Ms Heard failed to city [sic] any unfair prejudice,” the documents say.</p>
<p>“Even assuming arguendo Ms Heard’s latest thesis i.e. that a son served instead of his father, there would be no prejudice as Juror 15 was qualified to serve as a juror in Fairfax County and was vetted by the court and the parties’ counsel just as all of the other jurors were.”...</p>

<p>Все мы знаем о блестящей победе Джонни Деппа на суде в Фэрфаксе и радуемся вместе с ним.</p>

<p>Поэтому Джонни Деппу может понадобиться наша помощь, в том числе и в судебных делах. На суд повлиять сложно, тем не менее, петиция может оказать свою положительную роль, как и ваши выступления в соцсетях и СМИ.  </p>

<p><strong>The article ""Amber Heard’s attorneys ask court to set aside defamation verdict""</strong><br><em><strong>In a wide-ranging court memorandum, attorneys for the ""Aquaman"" actress argued that evidence doesn’t support the $10 million verdict awarded to her ex-husband, Johnny Depp.</strong></em></p>
<p>FAIRFAX, Va. (CN) — Attorneys for Amber Heard Friday asked a Fairfax County Circuit Court judge to toss a jury’s verdict that the actress defamed her ex-husband, Johnny Depp.</p>
<p> In a 43-page memorandum, Heard’s legal team argued that the award — more than $10 million — was unsupported by evidence. They took issue with Depp’s contention that he lost his role in “Pirates of the Caribbean” because of statements made by Heard in an op-ed. And they charged that at least one juror was not properly vetted by court officials.</p>
<p>The attorneys asked the court to set aside the verdict in favor of Depp in its entirety, dismiss the complaint or order a new trial.</p>
<p>Depp “proceeded solely on a defamation by implication theory, abandoning any claims that Ms. Heard’s statements were actually false,” argues the court brief, signed by Elaine Bredehoft, Heard’s lead attorney.</p>
<p>In an email, Ben Chew, who heads Depp’s legal team, dismissed Heard’s motion as “what we expected, just longer, no more substantive.” </p>
<p>A trial pitting the two actors spanned six weeks from April until early June and focused on Depp’s allegations that he was defamed by a 2018 op-ed that appeared in The Washington Post under Heard’s byline. In the article, Heard recounted that she had become a public figure representing domestic abuse and pinpointed a period two years earlier — 2016, when Heard took out a temporary restraining order against Depp.</p>
<p>In the verdict, the jurors found that Heard defamed Depp with three statements in the op-ed — one of which was a headline that Heard didn’t write. According to the court brief, “Ms. Heard never even became aware of the headline until Mr. Depp filed the lawsuit against her.”</p>
<p>Heard retweeted the article, and the headline was part of the tweet. But she also included a message with the tweet. And in jury instructions, Chief Judge Penney Azcarate wrote, “merely linking to an article does not amount to republication but adding content to a linked article may constitute republication.” She told the jury they must determine “whether any added content was intended to reach a new audience.”</p>
<p>Heard’s lawyers argued that republication requires “editing and retransmitting the defamatory material or redistributing the material with the goal of reaching a new audience.” Heard, they argued, “never edited or played any role with the respect to the headline” and the tweet she added does not constitute editing the article.</p>
<p>Another part of the motion focuses on Depp’s award. Jurors handed down a split verdict — essentially finding that the two had defamed one another. Depp, 59, was initially awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, but the judge reduced the latter to the statutory maximum of $350,000. The jury also found that Heard, 36, was defamed by a statement made by one of Depp’s attorneys. She was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and no punitive damages. For both amounts, the judge’s order set interest at 6% yearly.</p>
<p>In arguing that Depp’s award was excessive, Heard’s lawyers contended that Depp and his legal team broadened the parameters of damages against the actor during the trial. Depp “represented to the court he would limit his damages to the period Dec. 18, 2018 through Nov. 2, 2020,” the legal brief argued. Instead, Depp “continued to urge the jury to restore his reputation and legacy to his children as a result of Ms. Heard accusing Mr. Depp in May 2016 of domestic violence.”</p>
<p>Heard’s lawyers also asked the court to investigate whether one juror improperly served on the jury.</p>
<p>On a court list, the juror’s birthday was 1945. But the juror, identified in the filing as Juror 15, “was clearly born later than 1945. Publicly available information demonstrates that he appears to have been born in 1970.This discrepancy raises the question whether Juror 15 actually received a summons for jury duty and was properly vetted by the court to serve on the jury.”</p>
<p>The court clerk’s office has a statutory obligation to verify the identity of the jurors. But in this case, “it appears his identity could not have been verified…”</p>
<p>To be sure, Azcarate, who presided over the trial, signed an order June 24 making the jury’s verdict official. And during the hearing, she made it clear that she was not inclined to schedule further hearings.</p>
<p>Depp previously brought a libel case against The Sun, a UK newspaper that had described the actor as a wife beater. He lost that case. Separately, he faces a lawsuit in Los Angeles brought by a film location manager who contends the actor punched him.</p>

Херд должна была предоставить свои гаджеты и доступ к облачному хранилищу для проведения экспертизы и установления достоверности фотографий, используемых ей в качестве доказательств до 30 ноября.</p>
<p>Однако до 2 марта 2022 г. эксперт Деппа, Брайан Ньюмейстер, не получил от Херд и ее экспертов ни единого файла для проведения анализа. Даже после того как данные были высланы, не обошлось без происшествий. Так, например, выслав зашифрованный архив с файлами, сторона Херд не указала пароль для доступа к нему. В следующий раз были пересланы только обработанные фото без оригинальных “сырых” фотографий, которые и нужны для экспертизы.</p>
<p>На данный момент большинство данных предоставленных Херд либо не относятся к делу, либо повреждены. Из 58 тыс. файлов полученных мистером Ньюмейстером, большая часть это фото не предназначенные для экспертизы – это фото мистера Деппа, собственности и текстовые сообщения, а не мисс Херд. Также большинство файлов не пригодно для экспертизы: фото, указанные как оригинальные файлы не содержат так называемых цифровых отпечатков. Метаданные некоторых фотографий показывают, что они были сделаны в 70-80х гг прошлого столетия, что является невозможным. Одной из причин этого, могло стать намеренное или случайное использование стороной Херд устаревшего и нелицензионного ПО для извлечения файлов. Все это привело к тому, что мистер Депп понес финансовые издержки, а его эксперт мистер Ньюмейстер не успеет провести анализ файлов до начала судебного разбирательства.</p>
<p>Мистер Депп просит суд:</p>
<p>1) обязать мисс Херд полностью возместить траты мистера Деппа на услуги эксперта Брайана Ньюмейстера и судебного посредника Крэйга Янга;</p>
<p>2) признать все фотографии предполагаемых травм мисс Херд, на которые она собирается опираться в ходе суда, недопустимыми в качестве доказательств;</p>
<p>3) в качестве альтернативы второму пункту, суд должен проинструктировать жюри присяжных о том, что они могут считать, что все фотографии, используемые мисс Херд в ходе суда, были изменены или подделаны, с целью показать травмы, которых на самом деле не было.</p>
<p>Напомним, что судебное разбирательство начнется уже 11 апреля.</p>

4,StarterPetitionUpdate,30088887,2022-01-19T18:48:56.000Z,,"Джонни Депп. Как выйти из порочного круга, в котором мы оказались?","<p>Просматривается три пути, как в известной сказке.<br>Первый путь - плыть по течению, таких великий поэт Байрон называет рабами.</p>
<p>Второй путь - это наш путь, борьба за торжество науки, поддержка ученых, которые работают в направлении универсальной защиты человека от множества респираторных вирусов. Поддерживать всех, кто борется за торжество науки.</p>
<p>Третий путь - его указал гениальный наш писатель Достоевский. Он писал - красота спасет мир. Он имел в виду красоту духовную. Этот путь выбирает выдающийся американский актер, режиссер, продюсер Джонни Депп. Федор Достоевский является его любимым писателем. Это тоже наш путь, и здесь тоже нужна поддержка.</p>
<p>Почему Достоевский считал именно так? Потому что спасти мир могут только люди духовно развитые, имеющие высокую нравственность. Они просто неспособны идти по тому тому пути, по которому мы сейчас идем.</p>
<p>А как поднять эту нравственность? По выражению Ленина, ""Из всех искусств для нас важнейшим является кино“ <a href=""https://g-gumbert.livejournal.com/157742.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://g-gumbert.livejournal.com/157742.html</a><br>Это правильное высказывание, можно еще добавить - и ТВ.<br>Все знают, какие у нас фильмы и ТВ, не буду углубляться. А они оказывают огромное влияние на людей, особенно на детей и молодежь. Дальше это невозможно терпеть.</p>
<p>Это очень хорошо понял Джонни Депп. Фактически изгнанный из Америки, Голливуда, из фильмов, в которых он снимался, превращенный желтыми СМИ в монстра - правду никто не любит, Депп не сломался, выжил, он ведь стойкий борец за справедливость. Он не растерял миллионов поклонников своего творчества, которые помогли ему выжить.</p>
<p>Депп создал дочернюю компанию своей фирмы в Англии, с помощью которой он фактически начал мировую революцию в кино и ТВ. Цель Деппа и его команды - поднять кино до уровня высокого искусства. Свою способность это сделать он доказал такими фильмами как ""Великий"" (Минамата""), ""Город лжи"", который защищен к показу в Штатах, но был одобрен во всем мире.</p>
<p>Кто-то из великих сказал, сейчас не могу вспомнить - Бойтесь застенчивых, они правят миром. Это о Деппе. В тихом омуте как говорится... Знаменитый актер Марлон Брандо о Джонни, которому посчастливилось его застать: ""У него очень вежливые манеры, очень приятные и очень естественные. Но прежде всего, он чрезвычайно интеллектуален. Он почти совершенен. Я думаю, он приобрел все это в результате борьбы - ему приходилось много бороться в жизни, но он смог преодолеть трудности"".<br>В сообществе есть друзья Джонни, и они тоже могут это подтвердить.</p>
<p>Привожу отрывок из интервью Деппа в Барселоне, апрель 2021:</p>
<p>""...Пандемия. Мир спасут люди, а не правительства или крупные фармацевтические компании. Понять это очень просто, мы берем его в свои руки, хотя, возможно, он раздавлен переживаниями, которые мы испытали на протяжении всей жизни.<br> Если мы не открываем друг друга, если мы не преследуем одни и те же страсти и одни и те же цели, в конце концов мы все потеряем.  Это борьба сотрудничества и любви к жизни за надежду создать лучшие условия жизни для наших детей.</p>
<p>В китайском «И Цзин» есть символ, который переводится как «сила малого"", это изображение борьбы людей с монолитным монстром, когда ударяют по базе маленьким молотком, пока он не упадет.""</p>
<p>«Никогда не переставайте задавать вопросы. Вы должны противостоять средствам массовой информации, правительствам, людям, которые делают вид, что знают все и говорят, что могут контролировать вашу жизнь. Задавать вопросы, исследовать и исследовать все самостоятельно - вот в чем ключ. Никогда не сдавайтесь."" Джонни Депп.</p>

Речь шла о влиянии статьи, написанной бывшей женой Джонни, на его карьеру и репутацию. В том числе затронули и сотрудничество Джонни с компанией Disney.</p>
<p>- Вы назвали Шона Бэйли [продюсер в Disney] трусом?<br>Джонни: да.<br>- Почему?</p>
<p>Джонни: Потому что ему не хватило смелости... слушайте, я снялся в пяти частях этой франшизы, и я был рад принять участие в этих фильмах, я до сих пор счастлив, ведь это дало мне возможность создать персонажа, который подарил столько улыбок и радости, я этому рад.</p>
<p>Но когда люди - которые сделали на этих фильмах четыре, пять, шесть, семь, восемь миллиардов, причем, на фильмах с моим участием, а мой герой до сих пор является частью аттракциона «Пираты Карибского моря» в нескольких точках мира - даже не перезвонили мне, меня это удивляет. Они даже не нашли в себе смелости позвонить и уволить меня нормально, если они ссылаются на обвинения в мой адрес.</p>
<p>И все же они оставили якобы «избивателя женщин» на своем аттракционе, они до сих пор продают мерч с изображением якобы «избивателя женщин». Они даже продают пластиковые фигурки в виде меня. Так что - «подгнило что-то в Датском королевстве» [цитата из «Гамлета» - прим.пер.].</p>
<p>- Вы уверены, что не будете принимать участие в съемках шестой части?</p>
<p>Джонни: Уверен. Скажу вам честно, как перед Богом, - даже если мне заплатят $300 млн. и дадут миллион альпак в придачу, я не соглашусь снова работать с Disney над «Пиратами».</p>

<p>IN.2 is Depp’s newly-launched U.K.-based production house, a sister company to his L.A.-based Infinitum Nihil, which is courting original, stage and literature-based scripts for film, stage and television productions “focusing on European sensibility combined with American accessibility,” Depp and his partners explained during a San Sebastian press conference, which started with a crash and a screeching mike.</p>
<p>“That’s all the stuff I stole from this hotel, it wasn’t supposed to be in the mix,” joked Depp.</p>
<p>Producers Stephen Deuters (“Minamata”) and Stephen Malit (“Hector”) are also joining IN.2 as co-heads alongside Depp, and were in person in San Sebastian to jointly announce the new development deal with A Contracorriente Films. Sam Sarkar, CEO of Infinitum Nihil also joined the team.</p>
<p>In the release, Depp explained: “From the student to the maestro, from the aspiring artists to the yet-knowns, to the well-established great masters across all forms of modern media, IN.2 will build a space where artists can be artists, where they will be free to create those unexpected moments, those happy accidents that contain the propensity to constitute great art and so bring their unique vision to life.”</p>
<p>Speaking at the press conference in San Sebastian’s tony Maria Cristina Hotel, Depp pointed out that he had spent “many years working inside and outside of the Hollywood system and trying to persuade them that not every outing needs to be a blockbuster, that they don’t need to be formulaic, commercial drivel.”</p>
<p>“It’s ludicrous to play everything safe,” he added. “Cinema audiences are getting bored,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Referencing the new development deal, Blanco added that “We are delighted and proud to be working with Johnny Depp and his partners on this project, which is so timely for the new times, marked by a changing model in our industry. Being able to identify and produce films with the ability to target specific audiences will be key to remaining competitive.”</p>
<p>Depp and IN.2 are planning new projects with Julien Temple, who directed the Depp-produced “Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan,” which played at last year’s San Sebastian.</p>
<p>The pact also includes projects with Paris-based producer Jelena Goldback and London-based producer Alexandra Stone.</p>
<p>“We have a small slate of projects that we hope to have ready by the years 2022-2023, said Malit. “They’re not ready to go into production yet, but we’re here to say that we’re here, we’re starting,” he added.</p>
<p>Sarkar, whose long collaboration with Depp dates back from Depp’s years with the late ‘80s TV show “21 Jump Street,” reflected on the positive response in Japan to the film they recently produced, “Minimata,” starring Depp, which he saw as a template for what they were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>“’Minimata” is an example of the kind work that we want to continue doing, one that has meaning, that’s relevant. It’s about human behavior, about people and what they went through to achieve a resolution after being poisoned for decades. To bring that to the world’s attention is a great blessing for us,” he added.</p>
<p>Asked if he would act in some of the projects they would be producing, Depp replied: “If there’s something that they feel or I feel that I can add to the character, I’d be more than happy.”</p>
<p>“So the answer is ‘no,’ but ‘yes.’ I would like to say ‘yes’ without saying ‘no’ but agree to both,” he quipped.<br>Depp is becoming something of a regular at the Basque event. At a pre-ceremony press conference before receiving the festival’s top honor in recognition of his prolific career, Depp reflected on his three-plus decades in the industry, while avoiding questions about his personal life but hitting out at “cancel culture.”<br>John Hopewell contributed to this article.</p>

<p>JOHNNY Depp’s latest film is the story of Minamata Disease which was discovered in Minamata, Japan in 1956.</p>
<p>Depp here is the inquisitive photographer Eugene W. Smith who uncovered the cover-up around the poisoning.</p>
<p>I’ve always thought Depp was a true chameleon in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>He has the ability to shapeshift into any part and change his appearance depending on the role. He did that in Edward Scissorhands, he did that in Sweeney Todd, he did that in Ed Wood. Burton knows how to channel his chameleon charm and shape-shifting disappearances.</p>
<p>Even by Depp standards, he is unrecognisable with his grey beard and hair covering up his movie star perfection and instantly recognisable tan.</p>
<p>It’s a very minimalist performance that doesn’t require a lot of dialogue in his trademark Kentucky accent. Through his awkward gait and debilitating stutter, he lives, talks and breathes like Eugene Smith. It’s as if the man is in the room with us.</p>
<p>He gets to mouth lines like “I’m the single greatest photographer LifeMagazine has ever had” only for Bill Nighy to say “you’re the most impossible photographer Life has ever had.”</p>
<p>That line I felt was more a line expressing Depp’s impossible status as one of the most fascinating and eccentric men to ever appear on the big screen. He really is a thinking man’s movie star.</p>
<p>“The cover-up is going to be more expensive than the story itself,” he says and he’s right.</p>
<p>The figures are shocking and will get the liberally inflamed riled up and ready for action. You’ll cry for the deceased, you’ll pray for the living and you’ll froth at the mouth for those responsible.</p>
<p>This is a movie about a photographer and does feature some breathtakingly beautiful photos. He takes photos in black and white, with a tinge of infrared and a touch of colour. The photo sequences have an art to them that’s a lot like watching Andy Warhol; a sense that this could almost be a really expensive music video.</p>
<p>Eugene Smith’s work was integral in raising awareness of Minamata Disease and the cover-up and it’s essential this film was made and that people watch it so more awareness is raised of this little-known condition.</p>
<p>Then there’s the scenery which is 1950s Japan. And, boy, does it look beautiful. You really get the sense you’re living in another country and this film will crave you visiting Japan with a beat in your heart and a passion for the environment.</p>
<p>He’s better here than he has been in years – it’s a real skin-changing performance even by Depp’s standards where he just disappears into the part and you forget you’re watching the actor and just see the person.</p>
<p>In this movie, you’ll just see Eugene Smith and not see Johnny Depp. That’s the mark of a great actor.</p>
<p>__________________________________</p>
<p>Обзор Minamata: история триумфа фотожурналистики</p>
<p>По Roshan Чанди</p>
<p>Последний фильм ДЖОННИ Деппа - это история болезни Минамата, которая была обнаружена в Минамате, Япония, в 1956 году.</p>
<p>Депп - любознательный фотограф Юджин В. Смит, который раскрыл сокрытие отравления.</p>
<p>Я всегда считал Деппа настоящим хамелеоном во всех смыслах этого слова.</p>
<p>У него есть способность превращаться в любую часть и менять свой внешний вид в зависимости от роли. Он сделал это в «Эдварде Руки-ножницы», он сделал это в Суини Тодде, он сделал это в Эде Вуде. Бертон знает, как передать свое обаяние хамелеона и исчезновения, меняющие форму.</p>
<p>Даже по меркам Деппа он неузнаваем с седой бородой и волосами, скрывающими совершенство кинозвезды, и мгновенно узнаваемым загаром.</p>
<p>Это очень минималистичный спектакль, который не требует много диалогов с его фирменным кентуккийским акцентом. Из-за его неловкой походки и изнурительного заикания он живет, говорит и дышит, как Юджин Смит. Как будто мужчина находится с нами в комнате.</p>
<p>Он доходит до слов типа «Я лучший фотограф , которого когда-либо имел Life Magazine», но Билл Найи говорит: «Ты самый невозможный фотограф, который когда-либо был у Life ».</p>
<p>Мне показалось, что эта фраза была скорее выражением невозможного статуса Деппа как одного из самых очаровательных и эксцентричных мужчин, когда-либо появлявшихся на большом экране. Он действительно кинозвезда мыслящего человека.</p>
<p>«Сокрытие будет дороже, чем сама история», - говорит он и оказывается прав.</p>
<p>Цифры шокируют и заставят сильно воспаленных людей взбеситься и приготовиться к действию. Ты будешь плакать об умерших, ты будешь молиться за живых и будешь пенять изо рта за виновных.</p>
<p>Это фильм о фотографе, в котором есть несколько потрясающе красивых фотографий. Он делает черно-белые фотографии с оттенком инфракрасного и цветными. Последовательности фотографий содержат искусство, которое очень похоже на просмотр Энди Уорхола; ощущение, что это может быть очень дорогой музыкальный клип.</p>
<p>Работа Юджина Смита была неотъемлемой частью повышения осведомленности о болезни Минамата и сокрытии, и очень важно, чтобы этот фильм был снят и чтобы люди смотрели его, чтобы повысить осведомленность об этом малоизвестном заболевании.</p>
<p>Тогда есть пейзаж, который представляет собой Японию 1950-х годов. И, мальчик, это выглядит красиво. Вы действительно чувствуете, что живете в другой стране, и этот фильм будет жаждать, чтобы вы посетили Японию с биением сердца и страстью к окружающей среде.</p>
<p>Он здесь лучше, чем был за последние годы - это настоящая игра, меняющая кожу даже по стандартам Деппа, когда он просто исчезает в роли, и вы забываете, что смотрите на актера, и просто видите человека.</p>
<p>В этом фильме вы просто увидите Юджина Смита, а не Джонни Деппа. Это отличительный признак актера.</p>

<p><em><strong>""Он смешной, потому что он один из самых красивых мужчин в мире, а он тщательно это скрывает"". Хелена Бонем Картер.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни Депп: ""Иногда мне хочется сидеть на крылечке и пускать слюни""</strong> № 133, 23 Июля 2009г.</p>
<p><strong>""Эскапизм для меня</strong> <strong>- это способ выживания""</strong> (эскапизм - уход от действительности, если  кратко)</p>
<p><em><strong>- Жизнь во Франции изменила ваше представление о мире?</strong> </em><br>- Несмотря на то что у нас дом на юге Франции, большую часть времени мы проводим в Штатах - наши дети ходят здесь в школу. Франция дает мне ощущение покоя и дарит роскошь более простой жизни, потому что мы живем за городом, не убиваем время в ожидании звонков от агентов и руководителей студий - вы знаете, что я имею в виду. Жизнь там намного проще. Но я стал еще больше ценить не только Соединенные Штаты - еще Калифорнию и Лос-Анджелес. Людям полезно отдалиться от того места, где они живут.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Получается, что вы в определенной степени отдали дань своей родословной, которая берет начало от французских гугенотов?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Да, точно. Где-то между XVI и XVII веками.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Вы стали легендой при жизни. У вас есть рецепт того, как стать легендарным?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Я думаю, это можно сделать двумя способами: или улучшать жизнь людей, или убивать их.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Тогда что вы думаете о парадоксе: зрители больше симпатизируют плохим парням, чем хорошим?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Это зависит от того, какой смысл мы вкладываем в определение ""плохой парень"". Если бы я стоял перед выбором, к кому мне можно повернуться спиной и чувствовать себя в безопасности - к Эдгару Гуверу (бывший директор ЦРУ. - ""Труд-7"") или Джону Диллинджеру, - я бы предпочел Диллинджера. Гувер был липким, липким человеком, он оказывал влияние на правительство в течение многих лет. Что касается обаяния плохих парней, то это величина, зависимая от нашего сознания. Люди всегда останавливаются, чтобы получше рассмотреть автомобильную аварию. Вы не считаете это глупым занятием?</p>
<p><em><strong>- Можете ли вы сравнить свою собственную славу со славой Джона Диллинджера - в популярном чикагском кинотеатре ""Биограф"" его в свое время никто не узнал. Думаю, вы бы не остались незамеченным в шляпе и черных очках.</strong></em></p>
<p>- Это, конечно, нечто. Бродить по улицам и оставаться неузнанным - большое удовольствие. Но иметь возможность пойти со своими детьми в магазин, ресторан, Диснейленд или куда-либо еще и не попасться на удочку какому-нибудь фрику - это великолепно. Джон Диллинджер, конечно, был грабителем банков, это целый бизнес, но он имел возможность смешаться с толпой. Он спокойно просачивался через полицейские кордоны, приговаривая: ""Как поживаете? Как ваши дела?"" И все у него было в порядке, никаких проблем. А на Всемирной ярмарке 1933 года он вручил свой фотоаппарат полицейскому и спросил: ""Щелкнешь меня с моей подружкой?"" (Смеется.)</p>
<p><em><strong>- Есть ли на земле место, где бы вы остались неузнанным?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Хм, да (смеется). Маленький остров на Багамах. (Депп - владелец острова Little Hall's Pond Cay, который он приобрел за 3,6 миллиона долларов. На острове шесть пляжей, каждый из которых назван в честь дорогих ему людей - жены Ванессы Паради, детей Лили Роуз и Джека, а также Хантера Томпсона и Марлона Брандо. Пляж Heath's Place назван в честь Хита Леджера. - ""Труд-7""). Я там спокойно расхаживаю. Эскапизм для меня - способ выживания. ""Где семья, там и дом""</p>
<p><em><strong>- Как вам кажется, судьба Джона Диллинджера - пример того, как должен прожить свою жизнь мужчина?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Да, во многом это так. К счастью, лично мне не приходится выходить из дома с двумя кольтами 45-го калибра под мышками и автоматом Томсона в руках. До этого еще не дошло, слава богу. Надо понимать, что представлял собой Джон Диллинджер в те времена, особенно в 1933-м, когда банки были врагами, обдиравшими клиентов как липку, а люди вроде Джона Эдгара Гувера были хуже любых преступников. Диллинджер решил, что это его долг, который он будет выполнять столько времени, насколько его хватит. Я тоже решил идти только вперед и делать то, что считаю нужным. Правда, я стараюсь не обижать никого из тех, кого встречаю на своем пути. А перед Диллинджером я преклоняюсь.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Говорят, что вы с Диллинджером чуть ли не земляки.</strong></em></p>
<p>- Я родом из Овенсборо, штат Кентукки, а Джон Диллинджер с юга Индианы, что всего в 80 милях оттуда, поэтому немудрено, что у нас с ним много общего. Я это явно почувствовал, когда услышал голос его отца, напомнивший мне голос моего дедушки. В 1930-х нашел себе занятие по душе - днем он водил автобус, по ночам гнал самогон для засушливых округов. Работал в сфере услуг, можно сказать. Из воспоминаний о своей семье, своем отчиме, который провел несколько лет, обучаясь уму-разуму в Стейтсвильской тюрьме, - из всех этих ингредиентов я собрал образ Диллинджера. К сожалению, записи голоса самого Джона я так и не обнаружил - видимо, ее не существует. И отснятого материала с его изображением не так-то много. Но мне удалось представить себе его походку и вообще то, как он двигался. Думаю, меня просто посетил дух Диллинджера. А я верю в духов - не зря же в моих жилах течет индейская кровь.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Откуда взялись индейцы в вашей семье?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Это в основном со стороны моей матери. Мои прабабушка и дедушка по материнской линии были чероки. Я, видимо, унаследовал их гены. У дедушки была запоминающаяся внешность - скульптурное лицо с высокими скулами. Очень выразительное.</p>
<p><em><strong>- У русских тоже высокие скулы, как вы, наверное, знаете.</strong></em></p>
<p>- Давайте откроем совместный бизнес по имплантации скул! (Смеется.)</p>
<p><em><strong>- Это правда, что вы были странным ребенком?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Да, это потому, что я все делал дважды, то есть как бы копировал самого себя. Например, после того как выпивал стакан воды, я снова брал его в руки и притворялся, что пью, повторяя все движения, которые делал в первый раз. Это, конечно, было странным. Правда, ни один человек не хочет, чтобы окружающие думали, что он ненормальный, поэтому старается скрывать индивидуальность.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Страсть к путешествиям у вас от матери?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Мы переезжали с места на место, как цыгане. Лет с пяти и до того, как я стал подростком, мы сменили 30 или 40 домов. В то время мне казалось, что это вполне нормально - мол, где семья, там и дом. А домом я называю места, где мы жили, квартиры, фермы, мотели. В конце концов мы сняли настоящий дом, а вскоре переехали в дом напротив. Однажды я спросил маму, зачем мы так часто переезжаем. Ее ответ был невнятным.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Она развелась с вашим отцом?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Да, он ушел после 20 лет совместной жизни. Он был для нее всем - другом, любовником, отцом ее детей. Когда это случилось, мне было 15 лет. Вот тогда-то я и осознал, что они оба - самые дорогие мне люди. Я сильно переживал, но от боли было некуда бежать.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Увлечение музыкой помогло вам пережить это горе?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Когда мне было 12 лет, мама купила мне электрическую гитару за 25 долларов. Я считаю, музыка вообще спасла мне жизнь.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Это правда, что вживаться в роли вам помогает музыка?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Конечно. У каждого из наших ежедневных разговоров есть что-то вроде саундтрека - будь то сигналы машин на улице или шелест бумаги. Я стараюсь, чтобы музыка всегда была со мной. Ирония состоит в том, что на съемках у Майкла Манна я чаще всего слушал композицию Арти Шоу ""Кошмары"". И она подходит почти что к каждой сцене.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Как вы зарабатывали себе на жизнь, когда оказались на мели с вашей музыкальной группой?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Я занимался телемаркетингом и продавал рекламу - это была ужасная работа. ""Не думаю, что из меня бы получился хороший супермен в трико""</p>
<p><em><strong>- Как вам работалось с Марион Котийяр? Насколько важны для сюжета любовные отношения между вашими персонажами?</strong></em></p>
<p>- В фильме нет ничего важнее любви, Диллинджер полностью посвящает себя Билли. Так было и в реальной жизни. Искры летели, когда они встречались. Они оба были никому не нужными аутсайдерами и идеально подходили друг другу. А Марион идеально подошла для этой роли. За несколько месяцев до начала съемок она уже была в Чикаго, работая над акцентом. Она любит повторять, что я был с ней терпелив, но я думаю, что это она была терпелива по отношению ко мне.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Марион сказала, что согласно ее исследованиям после смерти Джона Диллинджера Эдгар Гувер хранил в банке его большой пенис. А вам попадалась на глаза подобная информация?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Да, попадалась, и оказалось, что у меня точно такой же (смеется).</p>
<p><em><strong>- Именно поэтому Марион была напугана предстоящими любовными сценами?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Нет, она просто не любит обнажаться, считает, что это слишком интимно.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Вы сказали, что Диллинджер жил во времена, когда мужчины были настоящими. Считаете ли вы, что в наше время они перевелись?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Вы просто посмотрите на моду тех времен: мужчины носили шляпы, костюмы, галстуки и пальто, что не свойственно современным мужчинам. В 30-е было мало таблоидов и совсем не было реалити-шоу, которые представляют собой последнюю стадию вуайеризма. Невероятно, что сегодня творится на телевидении. Если бы Диллинджер восстал из могилы и увидел все это, то сбежал бы куда подальше от безумия, к которому мы привыкли. Технический прогресс явно изменил наше сознание.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Что делает вас мужчиной?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Смена пола сделала меня мужчиной (смеется). Если серьезно, папаша получился из меня довольно-таки хороший, как мне кажется. Я стараюсь быть честным с собой и с теми, кого люблю.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Разве роль мужчины не ассоциируется у вас с храбростью, отвагой, уверенностью в себе?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Не знаю, насколько я отважен. А для того, чтобы это узнать, мне нужно оказаться в определенных обстоятельствах, а иначе никогда не угадаешь.</p>
<p><em><strong>- А что в таком случае делает вас женщиной?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Опять смена пола. Я то и дело перебегаю из одного пола в другой - туда-сюда, туда-сюда. А почему бы и нет?</p>
<p><em><strong>- Вы сравнивали себя с Диллинджером, который тоже жил на грани, пренебрегая своим здоровьем.</strong></em></p>
<p>- Я жил на грани довольно-таки короткий период времени.</p>
<p><em><strong>- Однако вам нравится играть антигероев и бунтарей.</strong></em></p>
<p>- Не думаю, что из меня получился бы хороший супермен и что мне подошло бы его трико.</p>
<p><em><strong>- У вас вроде бы есть все, о чем многие только могут мечтать: дома, яхта, остров. Как думаете, смогли бы вы обойтись без всего этого?</strong></em></p>
<p>- Бывает, я не хочу, чтобы меня спрашивали о кино и славе. Вместо этого мне хочется просто сидеть у себя на крылечке и пускать слюни. </p>

<p><em><strong>Dear friends!</strong></em><br><em><strong>The data presented are encouraging, but we must not lose our vigilance. In my opinion, everything can be expected from Heard, God forbid! Johnny really needs support, so we continue to sign and distribute this petition.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Дорогие друзья!</strong></em><br><em><strong>Представленные данные обнадеживают, но мы не должны терять бдительность. На мой взгляд, от Heard можно ожидать всего, не дай бог! Джонни очень нужна поддержка, поэтому мы продолжаем подписывать и распространять эту петицию.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard loses court ruling</strong> (Перевод на русский ниже. - Translation into Russian below).</p>
<p>Amber Heard's motion to exclude information about her alleged donation to the Children's Hospital of LA is denied. That means that we WILL find out if Heard made any donatios, and in what amounts. Or if any donations were made to her benefit, how much and by whom.</p>
<p><em><strong>Heard was also sanctioned fines that total more than $8,000 dollars, basically for wasting the court's time. Heard's motions were characterized as disingenuous and nonsensical by the courts.</strong></em></p>
<p>So it looks like the VA court is having none of Heard's antics, not only refusing her ""nonsensical"" motions, but also fining her for filing them frivolously.</p>
<p>These are good signs, people. Not only does it look like the court is not in Heard's pocket, but early signs are favorable towards Depp, which an unbiased court must be, considering his mountain of evidence, videos, witnesses, audio tapes, and so much more.</p>
<p>Youtuber Stevie J Raw does a great job of breaking down these latest revelations. Feel free to have a look at his video HERE. And he made that picture on the update. Let's all say thank yoou.</p>
<p>You can read about the latest ruling in the VA case HERE. <br>With these favorable findings, and rumors that hint at Johnny Depp's possible future film and/or television projects, it looks like things are looking up for Johnny. Here's hoping.</p>

<p><strong>Эмбер Херд проигрывает судебное решение</strong></p>
<p>Ходатайство Эмбер Херд исключить информацию о ее предполагаемом пожертвовании Детской больнице Лос-Анджелеса отклоняется. Это означает, что мы узнаем, сделала ли Херд какие-либо пожертвования и в каком размере. Или были ли сделаны какие-либо пожертвования в ее пользу, сколько и кем.</p>
<p><em><strong>Херд также была оштрафована на общую сумму более 8000 долларов, в основном, за напрасную трату времени суда. </strong></em><em><strong>Ходатайства Херд были охарактеризованы судами как лицемерные и бессмысленные. </strong></em></p>
<p>Таким образом, похоже, что в суде штата Вирджиния нет выходок Херд, он не только отклоняет ее «бессмысленные» ходатайства, но и штрафует ее за легкомыслие.</p>
<p>Это хорошие знаки, люди. Мало того, что суд выглядит не как<br>в кармане Херд, но и первые признаки благоприятствуют Деппу, что, должно быть, беспристрастно, учитывая его горы доказательств, видео, свидетелей, аудиозаписи и многое другое.</p>
<p>Ютубер Stevie J Raw отлично разбирается в этих последних откровениях. Не стесняйтесь посмотреть его видео ЗДЕСЬ. И он сделал эту фотографию в обновлении. Давайте все скажем спасибо.</p>

<p><em><strong>""Я подаю этот иск не только с целью очистить свое имя и восстановить репутацию, но также хочу внести ясность в жизни женщин и мужчин, в жизни которых присутствовало насилие, и от имени которых выступала мисс Херд"" </strong></em><br><em><strong>© ДжонниДепп</strong></em></p>
<p>«…Британский судья вынес свое решение, команда Джонни в свою очередь подает апелляцию, что вполне логично, учитывая многие нестыковки в финальном документе (вердикт) , который попал в Сеть сегодня утром... </p>
<p>Мы с вами на протяжении трех недель следили за процессом, вели трансляции в прямом эфире и выслушали всех свидетелей, а также ознакомились с огромным потоком документации, поступившей с обоих сторон (вы можете найти наши трансляции по хештегам, указанным в этом посте). На фоне всего услышанного, решение судьи Никола выглядит максимально предвзято. Мы приведем некоторые моменты, которые смутили нас больше всего, вы же можете ознакомиться с документом и составить свое мнение: </p>
<p>Во-первых, судья не счел само решение истца подавать иск рациональным, ввиду того, что «нет доказательств нанесения прямого вреда репутации истца», а также «претензии авторов статьи были направлены по большей части на Джоан Роулинг, а не на самого актера» (все мы знаем, какую реакцию вызвала статья в свое время, и с какими репутационными проблемами столкнулся Джонни). </p>
<p>Далее судья посчитал Кейт Джеймс (бывшую ассистенку Херд) неубедительным свидетелем, так как, по словам судьи, «у нее были причины озлобиться на мисс Херд из-за увольнения». Показания Кейт Джеймс есть на нашей стене, вы можете ознакомиться с ее допросом. </p>
<p>Ответственность за инцидент с собаками судья переложил на Джонни, хотя владельцем животных является Эмбер Херд, а потому вся документация, связанная с провозом животных через границу, ложится на владельца соответственно. Также судья не принял во внимание утверждения Кейт Джеймс и Кевина Мерфи в том, что Херд заставила их подделать бумаги на провоз животных под угрозой увольнения. Судья счел их слова беспочвенными. </p>
<p>Судья посчитал, что Херд настаивала на встрече после получения запретительного ордера исключительно из-за испытываемых чувств к Джонни, несмотря на то, что, по словам судьи, он пугал ее. Судья уверен, что никакой финансовой выгоды в этой ситуации она не искала. </p>
<p>Также судья не посчитал слова доктора и медсестры, оказывающих помощь Джонни, когда тот получил травму пальца в Австралии, достаточными, чтобы обвинить в происшествии Херд. Вместо этого судья выразил уверенность в том, что мисс Херд хоть и не была заложником в австралийском доме, тем не менее испытывала страдания от действий мистера Деппа. И снова читаем показания свидетелей, присутствовавших на месте, когда произошел инцидент. </p>
<p>И еще: по мнению судьи, «голддиггерша» не стала бы отдавать 7 миллионов на благотворительность. Как мы помним, Эмбер Хёрд отказалась предоставить документы, подтверждающие реальный перевод средств на благотворительность. Выводы делаем сами…»</p>
<p><em><strong>Российский сайт Джонни Деппа</strong></em><br><em><strong>2 ноя 2020</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>«Дженни Афия из юридической фирмы Шиллингс, представляющей Деппа, заявила:</strong></em></p>
<p>«Больше всего беспокоит то, что судья полагается на показания Эмбер Хёрд и соответственно игнорирует множества контрдоказательств со стороны полицейских, практикующих врачей, собственного бывшего помощника Хёрд, других неоспоримых свидетелей, и множество документальных доказательств, которые полностью опровергают утверждения по пунктам.</p>
<p>Все это было упущено из виду. Решение настолько ошибочно, что для г-на Деппа было бы смешно его не обжаловать».</p>
<p>«Мы надеемся, что в отличие от этого дела, продолжающееся судебное разбирательство по делу о клевете в Америке будет справедливым,<em><strong> и обе стороны предоставят полное раскрытие информации, а не одна из сторон,</strong> </em>стратегически выбирающая, на какие доказательства можно и нельзя полагаться» — сказала юрист». </p>","{'id': '224819062', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/0/is/oi/pvISOimyEEMeJho-800x450-noPad.jpg?1604605050', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

<p>Лондонский суд до сих пор не вынес своего вердикта. Ожидается решение в этом месяце.</p>
<p>Кратко о недавно прошедших событиях. 20 сентября этого года  документальный фильм Crock of gold: a few rounds with Shane Macgowan (Кувшин с золотом: несколько раундов с Шейном Макгоуэном) получил специальный приз жюри на кинофестивале в Сан-Себастьяне (Испания). Джонни Депп в этом году приехал в Сан-Себастьян в качестве продюсера этого фильма, который рассказывает историю лидера фолк-панк-группы The Pogues Шейна Макгоуэна. 2 октября этого года в рамках кинофестиваля прошла премьера этого фильма на 16-го Цюрихском кинофестивале.</p>

<p>О голосах своих персонажей в фильмах:<br>“These voices are based on the ingredients with which I serve a character. For me, Grindelwald is a fragile, thin piece of crystal. I want him to speak like you're tapping a wine glass. And a bit like one of those TV preachers or politicians who lulls you. "" - Johnny Depp at ZFF.</p>
<p><em><strong>«Эти голоса основаны на ингредиентах, из которых я создаю персонажа. Для меня Гриндельвальд - хрупкий тонкий кусок хрусталя. Я хочу, чтобы он говорил так, будто ты постукиваешь по бокалу вина. И немного похож на одного из тех телевизионных проповедников или политиков, которые убаюкивают вас.""- Джонни Депп на ZFF.</strong></em></p>
<p>""I want to be a punk rock actor. I don't want applause for compliant roles."" - Johnny Depp at ZFF Masters.</p>
<p><em><strong>«Я хочу быть актером панк-рока. Я не хочу аплодисментов за послушные роли». - Джонни Депп на ZFF Masters.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>«Она [жизнь] идет вперед! Просто продолжайте двигаться вперед. В моем теле нет ни капли честолюбия. Все эти награды - я ненавижу саму мысль о соревновании». - Джонни Депп на ZFF Masters.</strong></em></p>
<p>Johnny Depp about music at ZFF Masters:<br>""Music is the fastest way to your creative source, to your feelings. Certain songs from your childhood, listen to these too, they will bring you back to your experiences. I use music every day in my job as an actor. I think I don't need acting when I'm making music. Again, that's great. ""</p>
<p><em><strong>Джонни Депп о музыке в ZFF Masters (перевод):</strong></em><br><em><strong>«Музыка - это самый быстрый путь к вашему творческому источнику, к вашим чувствам. Некоторые песни из вашего детства, послушайте их тоже, они вернут вас к вашим переживаниям. Я использую музыку каждый день в своей работе как актер. Я думаю, что мне не нужно играть, когда я занимаюсь музыкой. Опять же, это здорово.""</strong></em></p>
<p>Johnny Depp on his first meeting with Shane MacGowan:<br>""I have no idea what fascinated me about him! I was amazed at many things. When I first met Shane, the first thing I thought was: Okay, now I've just met one of my heroes. I couldn't really take in what he was saying to me. Whatever it was, I don't think he liked me that much. But we started hanging out. ""</p>
<p><em><strong>Джонни Депп о своей первой встрече с Шейном Макгоуэном:</strong></em><br><em><strong>- Понятия не имею, что меня в нем привлекло! Я был поражен многими вещами. Когда я впервые встретил Шейна, первое, что я подумал, было: хорошо, теперь я только что встретил одного из моих героев. Я никак не мог взять в толк, что он мне говорит. Как бы то ни было, не думаю, что я ему так уж нравился. Но мы начали тусоваться вместе. ""</strong></em></p>
<p>Johnny Depp Depp on the documentary with Shane McGowan:<br>""It was interesting, kind of. It wasn't an ordinary production and we certainly knew that Shane was an unpredictable person.""</p>
<p><em><strong>Джонни Депп Депп о документальном фильме о Шейне Макгоуэне:</strong></em><br><em><strong>«Это было в некотором роде интересно. Это была необычная постановка, и мы, конечно, знали, что Шейн непредсказуемый человек».</strong></em></p>
<p>""Things come and go. I don't have high expectations of a film other than simply to get to the result, to walk the path to the result. I just take day after day and move forward. Just forward, it's very easy. Just stay on your path &amp; breathe""- Johnny Depp</p>
<p><em><strong>«Все приходит и уходит. У меня нет больших ожиданий от фильма, кроме как просто добраться до результата, идти по пути к результату. Я просто  день за днем  двигаюсь вперед. Просто вперед, это очень легко. Просто оставайся на своем пути и дыши» - Джонни Депп.</strong></em></p>

<p>""Obviously Johnny can wear a bin bag and somehow make it work but it's as if the #metatron scarves were made for him ! suspect it's because he really is an angel in disguise, the incredible amount of energy and compassion and appreciation and grace and gratitude and respect and encouragement and concern that he shows for everyone around him all day long (and the day can be very long!) is nbelievable, he simply never gets tired of meeting with people who want to meet<br>him and he shows the same amazing enthusiasm for every single person, he truly values each of the souls who show up. I don't think he has a clue what a beautiful soul he is himself and how much joy he is bringing to the world"" - Victoria Mary Clarke on Facebook</p>
<p>- Очевидно, Джонни может носить мусорный мешок и каким-то образом заставить его работать, но это так, как если бы шарфы #metatron были сделаны для него! (Виктория Мэри Кларк попросила Джони Деппа продемонстрировать шарфы). <em><strong>Подозреваю, что он действительно замаскированный ангел, невероятное количество энергии, сострадания, признательности, грации и благодарности и уважение, ободрение и забота, которые он проявляет ко всем вокруг себя в течение всего дня (а день может быть очень длинным! Не верится, он просто никогда не устает встречаться с людьми, которые хотят встретиться</strong></em><br><em><strong>он и сам проявляет такой же удивительный энтузиазм по отношению к каждому отдельному человеку, он искренне ценит каждую душу, которые появляются.

15,StarterPetitionUpdate,27572066,2020-08-22T11:49:05.000Z,,ДВОЙНОЙ ДЖОННИ,"<p>Уважаемые друзья!</p>
<p>28 июля 2020 суд по делу Depp vs The Sun завершен, вердикт будет объявлен не раньше сентября. Возможно и в октябре, поскольку судье предстоит изучить множество документов. Джонни держался на суде очень хорошо, естественно, что он говорил только правду. Херд, напротив, лгала, путалась, однако отстаивала свое мнение. Джонни Депп со своей юридической командой вышли из здания суда как победители, чего не скажешь о Херд. Будем ждать решения суда. </p>
<p><strong>Теперь, собственно, статья ДВОЙНОЙ ДЖОННИ </strong></p>
<p>Л. Мессина</p>
<p>D la Repubblica delle Donne</p>
<p>25 сентября 2001 г.</p>
<p>Бунтующий панк или преследователь преступника-убийцы Джека Риппера? Новый Джонни Депп родился в двух фильмах.</p>
<p>Его известность похожа на вызывающий тревогу штамп: профессиональный мятежник. Но если вы случайно встретитесь с ним, вы окажетесь один на один с самым деликатным наркоманом на свете, ангелом, одетым наполовину как старый хиппи, наполовину как молодой реппер, с джентльменскими манерами хорошо образованного молодого человека. Как однажды сказал режиссер Майкл Ньюэл, это тот тип юношей, которых ""вы бы мечтали представить своим матерям"", и который не хочет быть упомянутым в давнем событии, произошедшем в гостиничном номере: ""Да, было такое, но я дорого заплатил за то, что сделал"". Сегодня он делает признание: ""Ничего нет на свете дороже семьи"".</p>
<p>В ""Загадочном Джонни Деппе"" кроется высокое качество: его вообще не возможно заподозрить в фальши. Невозможно не верить ему, когда он говорит: ""Я никогда не надеваю масок, я - настоящий"". Вы слышите это каждый день от разных актеров, и из их уст эти слова звучат, подобно лжи. Но в случае Джонни Деппа его карьера сама свидетельствует о борьбе за то, чтобы сохранить свою подлинность, не дать съесть себя Голливуду. Это может показаться непосильной задачей, если вы, как и Джонни, оказались в образе тин-звезды полицейского сериала ""21 Джамп Стрит"". В 20 лет он уже являлся таковым.</p>
<p>Если бы Джонни выбрал популярное кино, он со своим харизматичным взглядом мог бы легко конкурировать и даже превзойти таких актеров своего поколения, как Том Круз. Но вместо этого он оставил сериал и выбрал свою первую главную роль в фильме ""Плакса"", проекте американского режиссера Джона Уотерса. Затем началась работа с Тимом Бертоном (с Бертоном они сделали три фильма, разделяя друг с другом неугомонность и сверхъестественность), Терри Гиллиамом, Лассе Хольстремом, Эмиром Кустурицей, Романом Полански, в фильмах режиссеров-аутсайдеров, предложивших ему сложные, темные и странные роли.</p>
<p>Если вы спросите его, сыграет ли он когда-нибудь ""нормальную"" роль, Депп с удивлением посмотрит на вас широко открытыми глазами, словно маленький ребенок, и ответит: ""Что-то вроде мальчик встречает девочку, и затем теряет ее, встретив другую? Есть много актеров, прекрасно играющих ""нормальные"" роли, так почему же я должен идти их путем? Я не думаю, что это у меня хорошо получится, мне станет скучно, и я сойду с ума…"".</p>
<p>Деппу больше идут роли, в которых он чувствует себя уверенно: изгои, неудачники, люди у обочины жизненной дороги. ""Я в состоянии выразить чувства аутсайдеров. Я не считаю себя таковым, хотя и не объединен до конца с обществом. Есть вещи, которые общество считает нормальными, но для меня они представляют странность, или наоборот. Тим (Бертон) и я разделяем это чувство, этот путь к пониманию или непониманию мира"".</p>
<p>Сложные аутсайдеры - две последние роли, сыгранные Джонни Деппом. Главная роль в фильме ""Кокаин"" с Пенелопой Круз, недавно вышедший в Италии, и ""Из ада"". В первом фильме, режиссером которого является Тед Демме, Джонни играет роль Джорджа Джанга, человека, начавшего импорт кокаина в США в конце 70-х, ставшего миллионером, вступившего в меделлинскую картель Пабло Эскобара. Но его бизнес закончился тюремным заключением, которое продлится до 2014 г. ""Я встретился с этим человеком и провел с ним немного времени, стараясь украсть часть его жизни, его души. И после просмотра фильма он обвинил меня в чародействе, поскольку не мог ужиться с мыслью, что я за какие-то пару дней впитал так много от него самого. Так или иначе, я расценил его слова как огромный комплимент. Было очень просто изобразить его как одиозного человека, гораздо сложнее было показать его гуманность без осуждения. По сути, Джанг - жертва классической американской мечты: стремление получить как можно больше от жизни. Это то, чему нас всегда учили"".</p>
<p>Однако, в фильме ""Из ада"" браться Хьюджес дали Деппу роль инспектора Абберлина, кто в Лондоне 19 века (на съемочной площадке была создана точная копия местностей английской столицы 19-го столетия) преследует первого серийного убийцу Джека Риппера. И он сумел поймать его, хотя и не совсем традиционным методом: с помощью интуиции и галлюциногенных видений, последствий приема опиума. ""Мне понравился Абберлин за его нетрадиционность. Ему пришлось иметь дело с преступлениями, одновременно столкнувшись с собственным демоном, наркоманией. Он пытается убежать от собственных опасений"".</p>

<p>""В Высоком суде Лондона продолжаются слушания дела американского актёра Джонни Деппа против издателя британского таблоида The Sun (News Group Newspapers (NGN) и его исполнительного редактора Дэна Вуттона, начавшиеся 7 июля. Депп подал иск о клевете после выхода статьи, в которой его именуют «избивателем жены». Это безапелляционное утверждение основано на многократных обвинениях в семейном насилии, сделанных бывшей супругой Деппа Эмбер Хёрд во время их бракоразводного процесса в 2016-17 годах и после него. Тогда паре удалось развестись без суда, заключив соглашение о неразглашении. Однако даже после расторжения брака на вышеупомянутых условиях Хёрд неоднократно намекала на то, что насилие в их браке с Деппом всё-таки было. Также актриса выступала в различных общественных организациях и прессе в качестве выжившей жертвы домашнего насилия, получая за это гонорары и поддержку.</p>
<p>По словам адвоката Деппа, Дэвида Шерборна, в статье The Sun содержались «ложные заявления предельной серьезности» в отношении мистера Деппа, обвиняющие его в совершении серьезных преступлений в отношении мисс Хёрд, якобы «повлекших настолько серьезные повреждения, что она боялась за свою жизнь». «В статьях была развернута полномасштабная атака на истца, его выставили как избивающего собственную жену, сделали виновным во множестве эпизодов физического насилия», — говорит адвокат. «Позиция истца предельно ясна — обвинения мисс Хёрд являются абсолютной ложью. Истец не проявлял жестокости к мисс Хёрд, это она, напротив, была жестока к нему».</p>
<p>В своем заявлении Депп сказал: <strong>«Я из южной семьи, и моя мать с самого рождения прививала мне правило: ты будешь южным джентльменом, либо в тебя вобьют эту норму поведения. Даже в детстве рыцарство было чрезвычайно важным качеством для меня, и как бы старомодно это не выглядело, я до сих пор отношусь к этому очень серьезно. Прямота, достоинство, честность и уважение к женщинам - это были качества джентльмена и качества, которые я всегда должен был иметь. Как человек этой культуры я чувствую, что это сильная и центральная часть моего морального кодекса. Я бы никогда не ударил женщину ни при каких обстоятельствах, в любое время. Я нахожу это просто невероятным, и этого никогда не произойдет».</strong></p>
<p>Ответчик (NGN) защищает свою статью как правдивую и утверждает, что господин Депп «контролировал и оскорблял госпожу Хёрд». Суд проходит по системе, в которой истец и ответчик утверждают и защищают свой взгляд на дело. Таким образом, сторона Деппа будет доказывать, что в публикации The Sun содержится клевета, пагубно влияющая на репутацию и карьеру артиста, а сторона NGN продолжит настаивать на том, что утверждение об избиениях - чистая правда.</p>
<p>Все заявления, доказательства и свидетельские показания уже собраны судом в письменном виде. На слушаниях пройдёт перекрёстный допрос сторон: адвокаты NGN допросят самого Деппа и его свидетелей. Затем адвокаты Деппа проделают то же самое со свидетелями ответчика, начиная с Эмбер Хёрд. Устные показания будут сличены с письменными. В завершении слушаний адвокаты сторон выступят с заключительными заявлениями, в которых каждый попытается продемонстрировать, почему судебное разбирательство показывает несостоятельность дела другой стороны. Суд проводится без присяжных, и решение будет принимать судья, рассмотрев после слушаний все предоставленные документы.<strong> Время принятия решения зависит от судьи и может занять от нескольких дней до месяцев.</strong></p>
<p>Первые три дня слушаний были посвящены допросу Джонни Деппа, который длился по шесть-семь часов с перерывом на обед. Из вопросов адвоката NGN проясняется компрометирующая истца линия защиты — похоже, что издатели The Sun хотят выставить Деппа алкоголиком и наркоманом, регулярно проявляющим агрессию в пьяном виде и страдающим провалами в памяти. Поскольку найти свидетельства подобного крайне сложно (за исключением Хёрд, все друзья, коллеги и бывшие возлюбленные Деппа единогласно отзываются о нём, как о милейшем человеке) — защита прошлась по всей биографии артиста. И обнаружила в ней два агрессивных эпизода: «разгром» гостиничного номера в 1994-м году и случай 1998-го года, когда Депп угрожал куском доски толпе из 15-ти папарации, намеревающихся сфотографировать беременную Ванессу Паради. По словам актёра, он хотел отвлечь их внимание на себя. И его, в общем-то, можно понять.</p>
<p>Допрос Деппа вёлся в наступательной манере и основывался на заявлениях Эмбер Хёрд и личной электронной переписке — в процессе подготовки к суду адвокаты Деппа случайно предоставили стороне Хёрд доступ к огромному массиву приватных сообщений их клиента. Таким образом, например, открылось, что Джонни позволил своей 13-летней дочери Лили-Роуз Депп попробовать выкурить марихуану в своём присутствии. Также была оглашена (явно юмористическая) переписка Деппа с его другом, актёром Полом Беттани. В которой Беттани предлагает Деппу беспроигрышный бизнес-план: создать сайт под названием «Бобёр Эмбер Хёрд», посвящённый плюшевому бобру, и, снабжая общественность видео с сенсационными заголовками вроде «Джонни Депп побрил бобра Эмбер Хёрд», молниеносно разбогатеть на продаже рекламы на сайте. Также к делу прилагаются опубликованные недавно аудиозаписи разговоров супругов, доказывающие, что Эмбер неоднократно проявляла по отношению к актёру агрессию.</p>
<p>В своём «неотправленном письме» Хёрд именует Деппа «доктором Джекилом и мистером Хайдом», говоря, что «одну вашу половину я безумно люблю, а вторая меня пугает». Деппа попросили прокомментировать текст, и он сказал, что, очевидно, Эмбер с самого начала их отношений собирала своё досье на него, «которое, по-видимому, являлось страховым полисом на будущее».</p>
<p>Большую часть времени на допросах заняло выяснение подробностей «инцидента в самолёте» — Хёрд утверждает, что Депп ударил её на борту одного из частных рейсов пары. Адвокат заявил Деппу, что тот «выкрикивал непристойности», приревновав актрису к Джеймсу Франко, называл её шлюхой, а после «потерял сознание» в туалете. Депп отрицает такую трактовку событий: он действительно спал в туалете, скрывшись там от оскорблений самой актрисы: «Когда мисс Хёрд ругала меня, кричала на меня и так далее, она входила в раж и начинала нападать на меня физически».</p>
<p>На третий день слушаний допрос стал еще более стремительным и агрессивным, адвокат ответчика задавал вопросы в утвердительной манере. Подробно разбирался инцидент в Австралии, во время которого Депп лишился части своего пальца. Защита пока проигнорировала главный скандал Деппа и Хёрд, а именно — её обвинения в насилии и требование запретительного ордера в начале их развода, в мае 2016-го года. Адвокат стороны Деппа, возможно, сосредоточится на этом случае.</p>
<p>В итоге Депп не протестовал против утверждений о том, что в разное время был зависим от алкоголя, некоторых наркотиков и курения. Был согласен с тем, что они с Эмбер Хёрд много ругались и спорили, но полностью отрицал любые предположения о физическом нападении на бывшую супругу.</p>
<p>По словам экспертов, суды о клевете никогда не бывают «окупаемыми» в денежном эквиваленте — возможный штраф в Великобритании достигает сотни тысяч фунтов, а затраты на сам суд стоят миллионы. Но в данном случае дело не в материальной выгоде - на кону репутация обоих артистов. Джонни Депп решительно настроен очистить свое имя от всех порочащих намёков: после суда в Лондоне в следующем году состоится аналогичный суд в США - против газеты «Вашингтон пост», опубликовавшей в 2018-м году пространное эссе Эмбер Хёрд, в котором актриса опять писала о своём опыте жертвы домашнего насилия.</p>
<p>Напомним, что в мае 2016-го года Эмбер Хёрд подала документы на развод с Джонни Деппом, одним из условий которого был переход в собственность актрисы пятиквартирного пентхауза Деппа, в котором Хёрд тогда проживала со своими друзьями. После отказа в этом, актриса пошла в полицию с синяками на лице и получила запретительный ордер в отношении супруга, которого обвинила в нападении. Дело вызвало большой общественный резонанс, многие журналы поместили на обложку фото лица актрисы, но открытого разбирательства не произошло. Хёрд отказалась от своих претензий, и супруги подписали мирный договор. Теперь же Депп заявляет, что хочет максимально открытого суда общественности и утверждает, что агрессором в их отношениях была сама Эмбер, многократно нападавшая на него, оскорблявшая словесно и физически. По словам Деппа, Хёрд долгое время готовила свой обман и, в итоге, попыталась привести в исполнение при разводе. За прошедшие пару лет его команде удалось собрать множество свидетельств в подтверждение этих подозрений.<br>Слушания в Высоком суде Лондона продлятся три недели. Свои показания по делу предоставят также Эмбер Хёрд, Ванесса Паради и Вайнона Райдер"".</p>

<p><strong>Джонни Депп: «Я был легкой жертвой для расчетливой и нарциссичной Эмбер Херд»</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Актер признался, что ничто и никогда в жизни не оскорбляло и не расстраивало его больше, чем слова и поведение Херд по отношению к нему. </strong></em></p>
<p>Депп рассказал, что впервые встретился с Херд на кастинге, который она проходила для фильма «Ромовый дневник», после этого они начали общаться лишь во время промоушена фильма:</p>
<p>«Она была чертовски дружелюбна со мной, рассказала о своем разрыве с партнершей, поделилась чувствами на тот момент. Если бы я тогда знал то, что знаю сейчас, я был бы намного осторожнее с ней, но я не заметил подвоха».</p>
<p>«Она была красива, интересовалась моей жизнью и работой, я повелся на это. Мне казалось это проявлением любви.<em><strong> Намного позже я понял, что у нее был план — выйти за меня замуж, чтобы продвинуться по карьерной лестнице или получить финансовую выгоду, и она знала, как это сделать.</strong></em> Например, в то время она постоянно говорила мне, как ей нравятся мои фильмы, однако позже в наших беседах выяснилось, что она не видела ни одного из упомянутых фильмов. Она видела свою цель, а я оказался легкой мишенью».</p>
<p>Депп заявил, что время, проведенное вместе, было невыносимым, он добавил: «Она расчетлива, у нее расстройство психики, подтвержденное специалистом, она — социопат, нарцисс. Она эмоционально неустойчива».</p>
<p><em><strong>«Сегодня я уверен, что она пришла в мою жизнь, чтобы забрать все и разрушить все, что останется».</strong></em></p>
<p>Депп рассказал, что пара обращалась за помощью к семейному специалисту, который подтвердил наличие у Херд психических расстройств. Херд постоянно унижала Деппа и называла «жирным стариком», о чем актер также рассказал. По его словам, это «разбивало ему сердце», особенно когда она говорила о том, что он «ужасный отец». Депп принял решение подать на развод, когда нашел фекалии в своей постели. Он уверен, что их оставила либо сама Херд, либо кто-то из ее друзей, в то время как сама Херд утверждает, что это была шутка. <br>Депп заявил, что никогда не обижал ни Херд, ни других женщин в своей жизни:</p>
<p>«Я вырос на юге США, в нашей семье правила должны были исполняться с самого детства, этого требовала моя мать: ты либо ведешь себя как джентльмен, либо в тебя буквально вобьют эту норму поведения. Я всегда должен был проявлять почти рыцарское поведение по отношению к женщинам, даже когда я был ребенком, неважно, насколько устарела подобная установка, я считаю ее очень важной. <em><strong>Следование моральным принципам, благородство и честность, а также уважение к женщинам — все это относится к описанию джентльмена, я всегда старался придерживаться подобного поведения.</strong> </em>Ни при каких обстоятельствах я не позволю себе ударить женщину. Это просто недопустимо и этого никогда не произойдет».</p>

<p>""Судья сообщил, что разбирательство по делу против британского таблоида все же состоится, несмотря на то, что актер не предоставил документы, которые требовали представители ответчика.</p>
<p>Депп подал в суд на Дэна Вуттона, выпускающего редактора издания The Sun, а также на Руперта Мердока, владельца издательского дома, которому принадлежит таблоид The Sun.</p>
<p>Депп обвиняет журналистов во лжи, которой была пропитана статья от апреля 2018 года, в которой актера прямо обвинили в избиении своей жены, не подкрепив свои слова никакими реальными фактами. Журналисты сослались на обвинения, которые ранее выдвинула Херд. Депп все обвинения всегда отрицал.</p>
<p>В прошедший понедельник над будущим разбирательством нависла угроза: судья обязал команду Деппа предоставить серию текстовых сообщений, в которых якобы идет речь об употреблении запрещенных препаратов, когда Депп вместе с женой был в Австралии в 2015 году.</p>
<p>Текстовые сообщения содержат диалог Деппа и его ассистента Натана Холмса. В это время, по словам Херд, она три дня переживала физическое насилие со стороны Деппа, который, опять же, по ее словам, находился под воздействием запрещенных веществ.</p>
<p>Однако после извинений команды Деппа за отсутствие данных сообщений и оповещении в невозможности их получения, судья дал «зеленый свет» разбирательству, которое начнется 7 июля и продлится три недели в Королевском суде Лондона.</p>
<p>Судья пояснил, что его решение связано с тем, что команда ответчика уже получила копии необходимых документов, которые также будут использованы в грядущем разбирательстве с Херд в будущем году"".</p>

<p>Возможно, из-за того, что обаяние Джонни отвлекало бы зрителей от основной темы... Но это был бы совсем другой фильм... Я не хочу сказать, что ДиКаприо плохо играет, но Джонни, как мне кажется, более сильный актер. L.P.</p>

19,StarterPetitionUpdate,27138079,2020-06-28T20:30:52.000Z,,"""Джамп стрит 21"", фрагмент","<p> </p>
<p>Фрагмент из 1 части</p>
<p>...Сериал ""Джамп-Стрит, 21"" стал настоящей сенсацией. Единственное, к чему не готов был Джонни Депп, так это к тому, что вместе с популярностью появятся и страстные поклонники его таланта. Но ему пришлось быстро привыкнуть. Держа нос по ветру, продюсеры ненавязчиво познакомили Джонни Деппа с миром подростковых журналов. ""Они пришли ко мне и сказали: ""Нам бы хотелось, чтобы ты дал несколько интервью для журналов"". Я поинтересовался, что это за издания, и они ответили: ""Звезда тинейджеров"", ""Жизнь тинейджеров"", ""Мечты тинейджеров"", ""Дерьмо тинейджеров""... и так далее"".</p>
<p>И вот уже Депп позирует фотографам в черной футболке и джинсах, сжимая пистолет, и его изображения расходятся миллионными тиражами. Тысячи журналистов заваливают его глупыми вопросами о том, какой цвет его любимый и какие марки одежды он предпочитает. Корреспонденты делают все возможное, чтобы приблизить кумира к своей аудитории. ""Я не в силах контролировать этот процесс, - признается Депп. - Приятно, когда тобой восхищаются, но я бы не сказал, что чувствую себя в своей тарелке. Мне никогда не нравилось быть в центре внимания"".</p>
<p>Патрик Хасбург видел, что Депп прекрасно справляется со своей ролью. Когда в апреле 1987 года сериал вышел на экраны, почва не ушла из-под его ног. ""Когда проект становится известным, у актеров, как правило, тут же начинается ""звездная болезнь"", но с Джонни этого не случилось. Только однажды я видел, как он вышел из себя на съемочной площадке, но это был обычный рабочий момент. Успех свалился на Джонни как снег на голову, он был не готов к этому, но держался молодцом. Я бы на его месте так не смог. Да если бы я был его ровесником и выглядел так же, то давно бы превратился в заносчивое чудовище. Девчонки ходили за ним по пятам, плача и вопя, это было настоящее сумасшествие!»</p>
<p>Я испугался, - вспоминает Депп о своих ощущениях, когда он впервые оказался объектом обожания миллионов фанатов. -Я был в ужасе. Ко мне подходили люди и начинали плакать. Все сравнивали меня с Джеймсом Дином, в лучшем случае - с Брандо и Де Ниро. Они тут же прилепили на меня ярлык, и неважно было, согласен я с ним или нет.</p>
<p>Очень быстро ""Джамп-Стрит, 21"" стал любимой ""мылной оперой» американок от восемнадцати до тридцати четырех лет. Депп с удивлением обнаружил, что его слава затмила даже славу Майкла Дж. Фокса на пике популярности сериала ""Семейные узы"". Самым красноречивым свидетельством тому, что Депп стал для молодых зрителей настоящим кумиром, являются, конечно же, письма фанатов.</p>
<p>""Джонни Депп получал писем в сотни раз больше, чем Майкл Дж. Фокс, Чарли Шин или Роб Лоуэ! У него была самая многочисленная корреспонденция из всех наших клиентов» - рассказывает представитель ""Фэн Хэндл"", почтовой фирмы, обслуживающей знаменитостей. - Депп получал около 10 тысяч с лишним писем в месяц. Впрочем, телезвездам всегда пишут больше, чем актерам кино».</p>
<p>""Я получал странные послания, в том числе и суицидальные; девочки грозились выброситься из окна, если я не отвечу им, и так далее, - говорит Джонни Депп о письмах своих поклонников. - Когда читаешь эти письма, то думаешь: ""Это все вранье"". А потом возникает мысль: ""А если нет?"" Не хочется испытывать судьбу! Я пишу им ответ, говорю, что раз сейчас все так плохо, это означает, что дальше будет лучше... Но ведь я и сам довольно неуравновешенный человек, так какое у меня право давать им советы?""</p>
<p>В почте Джонни Деппа смешные и нелепые письма соседствовали с настоящими воплями души. ""Дети рассказывали мне о своих проблемах, или о том, что они хотят покончить жизнь самоубийством, или еще о чем-то. Это пугaло. Мне хотелось закричать на весь свет: ""Я всего лишь актер! Я не психолог! Если вам нужна помощь - это не ко мне, вы ошиблись!""</p>
<p>Популярность сериала ""Джамп-Стрит, 21 » в США побила все рекорды. Съемочная группа отправилась в тур по городам, где их встречали толпы восторженных тинейджеров, мужчин и женщин, сгорающих от желания получить автограф или сфотографироваться со своим кумиром. Больше всего поклонники осаждали Джонни Деппа, которого привозили и увозили в больших лимузинах, в сопровождении двух телохранителей. Его фотографии украшали обложки множества подростковых еженедельников, а журнaл ""Роллинг Стоун"" включил его в число самых знаменитых людей 1988 года.</p>
<p>Джонни Деппу все это не очень-то нравилось, он никак не мог примириться с тем, что люди продают созданный средствами массовой информации образ и называют его Джонни Деппом. Очень быстро он разочаровался и в сериалах, в той роли, которую ему навязали и которой теперь торговали. Свои тревоги актер выразил в предисловии к книге ""Бертон про Бертона"", которая состояла из подборки интервью режиссера фильмов ""Эдвард Руки-Ножницы"" и ""Эд Вуд"" Тима Бертона: «Америка проглотила меня, я был потерян и подавлен. Мальчик из телевизора, кумир подростков, объект сексуальных фантазий и причина вздохов. Пластмассовый, нарисованный, смотрящий на вас с плакатов и обложек журналов. Я работал как исправный механизм. Мальчик-сенсация, мальчик на продажу».</p>
<p>Депп дошел до передела, он на дух не выносил сериал, в котором снимался. Дошло до того, что он перестал вникать в сценарий, просто заучивая свои реплики. ""Мне тогда открылся новый смысл всего происходящего. В моей голове гнездились мрачные мысли. В году триста шестьдесят пять дней, и двести семьдесят пять из них я занимаюсь тем, что произношу чьи-то чужие слова. И они неправильные, это плохие слова. Мне остается всего девяносто дней в году, чтобы сказать то, что я действительно думаю"".</p>
<p>Он был скован по рукам и ногам этим телевизионным сериалом, который приносил ему хорошие деньги и давал ощущение стабильности, но его терзали сомнения. Он видел, что находится в ловушке. Ему хотелось сниматься в художественном кино, но контракт с ""Джамп-Стрит, 21"" не позволял этого. Успех его героя, Хэнсона, отшвырнул самого Деппа на шаг назад, в то время, когда он еще не снялся во ""Взводе"". И теперь Джонни хотел во чтобы то ни стало порвать эти цепи. ""Я подписал контракт на съемки в шести сезонах сериала и начал сожалеть об этом раньше, чем состоялась премьера первой серии. Я впервые в жизни мог сам спокойно платить по счетам, но я видел, как меня продают и рекламируют. Я чувствовал себя коробкой кукурузных хлопьев!»</p>
<p>...Содатель сериала, Патрик Хасбург, считал, что герой Деппа очень близок молодому актеру. ""Этот парень пережил в детстве те же проблемы, что и школьники с Джамп-Стрит"", -заметил он однажды. Но к концу работы над четвертым сезоном у Джонни Деппа сложилось ощущение, что продюсеры не совсем понимают, кто он такой. ""Они хотели, чтобы я заявил всему миру: ""Привет, я Джонни Депп, послушайте меня, учитесь хорошо в школе и сдавайте экзамены на одни пятерки, и тогда весь мир будет у ваших ног..."" и тому подобную чушь. Я очень серьезно задумался. Я работал на этих людей четыре года - и что, они до сих пор не поняли, что я бросил школу, что любая система - не для меня? Как я моту убеждать других людей, что учиться в школе просто необходимо? Люди будут просто смеяться надо мной...</p>

<p><strong>Активист MeToo Аманда Декаденет больше не собирается поддерживать Эмбер Херд, так как чувствует себя обманутой</strong></p>
<p>Когда-то хорошая подруга больше не собирается оказывать поддержку Эмбер Херд после того, как прослушала записи, на которых Херд словесно оскорбляет Деппа. Эмбер ожидала, что Декаденет будет давать показания на ее стороне, однако, активистка и телеведущая изменила свою позицию, заявив, что она «в шоке из-за того, как Эмбер говорила с Джонни».</p>
<p>На мнение Аманды повлияли записи, которые будут использованы в ходе судебного разбирательства между Деппом и Херд, аудио были ранее опубликованы в издании DailyMail. На записях пара обсуждает инциденты и проблемы, произошедшие за период их брака. На записях Херд прямо заявляет Деппу, что ему «все равно никто не поверит» и что ему «нужно вырасти».</p>
<p>Декаденет — вторая фигура от MeToo на стороне Эмбер Херд, Роберта Каплан, которая также является сооснователем движения за права женщин, больше не представляет актрису в суде. Источник, близкий к Декаденет, сообщил, что она «чувствует себя использованной и обманутой Эмбер, Аманда надеется, что Эмбер окажут необходимую ей помощь»</p>
<p>Херд и Декаденет стали близкими подругами после скандального развода актрисы в 2016 году. Херд посетила вечеринку Декаденет на следующий день после того, как Депп якобы бросил в нее телефон. На вечеринке Херд старательно прикрывалась волосами.</p>
<p>В своей декларации Декаденет заявляет, что: <br>«Как активист и борец за права женщин я обязана принять во внимание слова женщины, которая заявляет о насилии. В течение долгого времени женщинам не давали слова. Поэтому у меня не было сомнений, когда Эмбер рассказала мне свою версию их взаимоотношений с Джонни». <br>Декаденет продолжает:</p>
<p>«Я приняла решение не давать показания в деле Джонни Деппа против The Sun. Также недавно я узнала некоторые факты, которые в корне изменили мое мнении по поводу происходящего. Когда появилось первое аудио, я услышала, как грубо Эмбер обращается с Джонни — настоящее психологическое насилие, я была просто в шоке. Я написала Робби Каплан, адвокату Эмбер, что мне срочно нужно поговорить с Эмбер. Пока мы говорили, я сообщила ей, что нахожусь в шоке от ее слов в сторону Джонни. Я категорически против такого. Эмбер сказала мне, что записи были отредактированы командой Джонни. Я надеялась, что Эмбер осознает вину, но этого не произошло. После этого я больше не общалась с Эмбер. Печально, что человек, за которого я вступалась и кому верила, не был честен. Хочу подчеркнуть, что я не знаю, что конкретно происходило за закрытыми дверями их дома. Я выступаю с желанием поддержать процесс, который раскроет правду».</p>
<p><strong>Адам Вальдман прокомментировал ситуацию:</strong></p>
<p>«Когда Аманда Декаденет, лучшая подруга Эмбер Херд и активист MeToo, отказывается поддерживать мисс Херд и свидетельствует против нее, это значит, мы приближаемся к тому, чтобы положить конец лжи Эмбер Херд против Джонни Деппа. Однако мисс Херд не могла осуществить эту аферу самостоятельно, без помощи влиятельных друзей. Мы выясним, кто за чем стоял, и сделаем это в суде. Мы с мистером Деппом прибыли в Лондон, чтобы подготовиться к процессу».</p>

<p><em><strong>Следует указать до интервью, что Джонни Депп очень искренний человек, и правда для него все. Он самокритичен до самоуничижения. Он говорит: ""Я – застенчивый человек, который легко ощущает боль. Не только физическую... Также и психологическую"". Поэтому он и другим людям боится причинять боль. И если Джонни  говорит, что боится причинить кому-то боль физическую или психологическую - это не подлежит никакому сомнению. А его выставили перед всем миром как жестокого абьюзера. Для него это - ужасная боль, он много времени я занимается тем, чтобы реабилитировать себя. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Так давайте поможем ему в этом! У него очень много врагов, в том числе и могущественных. Но нас тоже немало, и мы должны бороться за него, что называется, не на жизнь, а на смерть, то есть, жестко, решительно и беспощадно. Пусть это статья, петиция, дискуссия ... только так. А этому учиться мы можем у самого Джонни. Он очень смело выступил в Инстаграме за правосудие для 46-летнего афроамериканца Джорджа Флойда, зверски убитого полицейскими перед телекамерами и на глазах у людей. Джонни призывает к борьбе с расизмом и невежеством, порождающими такой ужас.. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Петиция собрала уже 2.969 подписей. До 3.000 осталась всего 31 подпись. Давайте, порадуем Джонни и приложим усилия, чтобы быстрее собрать эти подписи!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Интервью Джонни Деппа для бельгийского журнала «Joepie» </strong></p>
<p>""Джонни Депп теперь доступен с чувством сверхвины: «Моя единственная ошибка – то, что Кейт меня бросила!» <br>Однажды Джонни Депп сказал в интервью: «Из всех персонажей, которых я сыграл, Эдвард Руки-ножницы – тот, с которым я наиболее соотношу себя.<strong> Из-за чувства, когда ты хочешь прикоснуться к чему-то, но в то же время боишься сломать это!» Это многое говорит о том, кем на самом деле является этот красивый актер: не бунтарь Джеймс Дин 90-ых, не безумный чудак из его фильмов, а парень, который боится причинить кому-то боль или причинить ее самому себе. </strong></p>
<p><strong>«Грязный индеец»</strong> <br>Джонни не является привычным голливудским актером. Он не любит глэм и гламур. Он любит пиво и громкую рок-музыку. Он не сосредоточен на своем внешнем виде. Доказательство: старые джинсы и выцветшая полосатая футболка, в которых он пришел на встречу с нами. Он не пожал нам руки. Он робко улыбнулся нам, что мгновенно стало эквивалентом «искренне ваш». Когда он говорит, что он не очень гладко излагает свои мысли, это означает, что он иногда надолго задумывается перед тем, как дать ответ на наши вопросы, но этим мы только еще более очарованы им.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> <strong>Иногда я не могу выстроить свои слова и мысли в ряд. Мне сложно в точности выразить то, что я думаю.</strong> Я боюсь, это у нас в доме семейное. Никто там никогда по-настоящему не умел разговаривать друг с другом. Последствия: мои родители развелись, когда мне было 15. У меня было очень странное детство, но, вероятно, потому, что я произошел из очень странной семьи. Мои родители, мои брат и сестры – они все такие разные. Мы все очень разные. У нас нет ничего общего, кроме нашей фамилии. Странно, ты знаешь, принадлежать к семье, с которой тебе совершенно нечего делать.</p>
<p>Черные волосы, смуглая кожа и эти темные глаза: Джонни имеет индейские корни и знает об этом.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> У меня в венах есть кровь чероки, но я не думал об этом до тех пор, пока не стал тинейджером. Когда мне было 7, мы переехали из Кентукки на Юг Флориды. Там среди людей очень много расизма. <strong>Когда я был в старшей школе, другие дети доставляли мне трудные времена, называя меня «грязный индеец». Меня это очень смутило, потому что я думал, что я американец.</strong> Я забыл о своей четверти индейской крови. Но эти маленькие узколобые ребята напомнили мне об этом, и я рад, что напомнили. <strong>Потому что когда я начал узнавать больше о культуре индейцев, я осознал, что имею много от них во мне. Их способ мышления и соотношения вещей я унаследовал. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Джонни не религиозен. </strong>Он никогда не ходит в церковь. Не потому что он не хочет верить, а потому что он не хочет быть униженным.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> <strong>Я хочу верить, что существует Бог, но я не хочу, чтобы люди говорили мне, как мне следует восхвалять его.</strong> Один из моих дядюшек был одним из тех преподобных, которых вы часто видите на американском телевидении. Тот человек, который заставляет людей верить, что он сейчас исцелит их и спасет от зла. Ребенком я иногда ходил смотреть на него, но дома меня по-настоящему принуждали делать это. Я боялся этого человека, того, что он делал с людьми в церкви. Он вопил и кричал. А они плакали и восхваляли его. Я находил это больным – то, что эти люди были в его власти. У меня появилась настоящая неприязнь к телепроповедникам.</p>
<p><strong>«С тобой или без тебя»</strong> <br>В «Страхе и отвращении в Лас-Вегасе» он играет странного журналиста. Это одна из его ролей чудаков, и, конечно, все начинают интересоваться, является ли Джонни также странным в реальной жизни.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> *смеется* Несколько лет назад я еще был идолом подростков, а теперь я фрик. Но мне по-настоящему все равно, в какую коробку они меня поместят. Раньше я ненавидел, когда на меня навешивали ярлык. Я хотел быть просто Джонни. Собой. А теперь мне по-настоящему все равно. Я просто тратил энергию на это.</p>
<p><strong>Причина, по которой Джонни всегда выбирает играть этих странных персонажей, проста: они его привлекают. </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> Все, что в личности не является нормальным, привлекает меня. В основном потому, что вести себя странно – нормально для чудаков. Я думаю, что такие люди имеют более интересную жизнь, чем большинство из нас. Это непредсказуемо, они не знают, что с ними случится, где они в итоге окажутся. Ага, это кажется волнующим для меня. Но как и все остальные, я выбираю безопасность: я хочу иметь постоянный адрес, крышу над головой, достаточно денег в банке. Я играю безопасно, потому что я не хочу жить одним днем. Т<strong>ы знаешь, что я считаю по-настоящему странным? То, что мужчины любят смотреть спорт. Эти курсирования и вопли в маленькой коробке, у которой нет имени.</strong> Это нормально? Для меня это так же ненормально, как человек, который все время разговаривает сам с собой. *cмеется* Однажды я так делал… Так что, да, если так посмотреть, то, вероятно, я сам чудак. </p>
<p><strong>Джонни на самом деле сошел с ума. От супермодели Кейт Мосс.</strong> 3 года у них были отношения ссор и расставаний. Но всякий раз они снова оказывались в объятьях друг друга.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Кейт и я имеем что-то особенное вместе. Нам сложно жить вместе, но в то же время мы не можем жить друг без друга. Ты знаешь песню U2 <strong>«С тобой или без тебя»</strong>? Каждый раз, когда я слышу эту песню, я думаю про нас. Это по-настоящему печальная история. Наша тоже печальная. В настоящий момент мы теперь просто друзья, но когда я вижу ее, я чувствую намного больше, чем дружбу. Я по-настоящему люблю ее, поэтому мне сложно быть удовлетворенным дружбой. Как говорят мне мои друзья, мне не следует видеться с ней вообще, потому что иначе я ее никогда не забуду и не познакомлюсь с кем-то другим. Но я не могу: я не могу освободиться от нее.</p>
<p>Даже хотя Джонни и Кейт посетили премьеру «Страха и отвращения в Лас-Вегасе» в Каннах вместе, и все думали, что они снова сошлись, это было не так.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Выглядело так, да. Это потому что мы смотримся как созданные друг для друга. Мы нравимся друг другу и в нас сияет любовь. Мы не можем сдерживать это. Но мы были там уже как друзья. Из-за одной моей тупой ошибки. Это моя вина, что Кейт меня бросила. Я могу быть настоящей болью в заднице и вести себя по-настоящему раздражающе.<strong> Особенно когда я работаю над фильмом и что-то идет не так. Мне это действует на нервы и я становлюсь назойливым.</strong> Дома и на работе. Я не должен приносить свои проблемы домой. Или, по крайней мере, я не должен продолжать их. И в один день этого стало достаточно для Кейт.</p>
<p>В этот момент Джонни начинает все больше и больше говорить о детях.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em><strong>Я не знаю, как это случилось, но я захотел стать отцом.</strong> Это стало очевидным и я стал говорить об этом с Кейт. Я подумал, что она отреагирует с большим энтузиазмом, но она так не отреагировала. Кейт сразу же сказала, что в настоящий момент дети для нее – не вариант. Это стало для меня шоком. Я уже стал счастлив по этому поводу и никогда не думал, что она может быть не готова к этому. Я подумал, что время пришло. Я ошибался. Время не пришло. По крайней мере, не для Кейт. Теперь я боюсь, потому что она правильная женщина для меня, но ребенка со мной она не хочет иметь. Найду ли я когда-нибудь кого-то, как Кейт, кто захочет дать мне ребенка? Потому что я на самом деле хочу сына или дочь, кого-то, кому я смогу все свое оставить. Просто чтобы оставить кого-то после себя. Я не хочу, чтобы меня запомнили только по моим фильмам, я также хочу семью, которой у меня нет в настоящий момент. Но Кейт не могла дать мне того, что я хотел, и из-за этого дискуссии и проблемы стали нарастать. Поэтому не оставалось ничего иного, кроме как… *тихим голосом* да, кроме как покончить с этим.</p>
<p><strong>«Я прячу боль за агрессией»</strong> <br><strong>Джонни делает глоток воды и очевидно пытается скрыть свои эмоции. Неожиданно становится заметно, как он хрупок. </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Существует ошибочное мнение, что я крутой парень. <strong>Я – застенчивый человек, который легко ощущает боль. Не только физическую.</strong> Когда я был ребенком, я упал с велосипеда и рыдал как животное. До тех пор, пока моя мама не поцеловала меня в ногу, и все снова стало хорошо. <strong>Также и психологическую.</strong> Одна тупая реплика может полностью смутить меня. Или когда они говорят: «Джонни, ты полностью провалил сцену». Это меня просто вырубает! Потому что<strong> я хочу делать все настолько хорошо, насколько это возможно.</strong> Я хочу, чтобы все думали, что я усердный работник, что у меня талант. <strong>Как только кто-то критикует мою работу, я становлюсь незащищенным.</strong> Они могут сто раз сказать мне, что я хороший актер, но одна критика полностью разрушает мое самосознание.<strong> Раньше я реагировал иначе, чем сейчас: я начинал вести себя, как животное, становиться агрессивным.</strong> Но я делал это для того, чтобы скрыть свою боль. Мне стыдно за это сейчас. Потому что я знал довольно хорошо, что разрушение номера в отеле не облегчит мою боль. После этого я всегда чувствую себя еще хуже. Я только причинил самому себе боль, сделав это. <strong>Теперь я пытаюсь разговаривать с моими друзьями, когда мне плохо.</strong> Я уже говорил это: я не очень хороший собеседник, и поэтому это сложно. Но я заметил, что это помогает.</p>
<p>Джонни делает последнюю затяжку сигареты и затем откладывает ее. «Это была последняя…» - говорит он. <br><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Я уже говорил это много раз. Я могу перестать на один день, а потом снова хватаюсь за это. <strong>Это моя единственная зависимость, так что это окей.</strong> Одна смерть от наркотиков в «Вайпер Рум» - это более чем достаточно. Смерть Ривера по-настоящему повлияла на меня. Он был так молод и так красив. Это так ужасно, что мальчик умер так рано! Но это был его собственный выбор. Он знал опасность наркотиков. Он играл с огнем. Слишком плохо"".</p>

<p>Дорогие друзья!</p>
<p><strong>Сначала немного о Джонни Деппе в качестве дополнения к предыдущему обновлению.</strong> Из Москвы Джонни приехал в Санкт-Петербург, где у него был концерт. Петербуржцы очень тепло его встречали и всех участников рок-концерта. Джонни фантастически играет на гитаре, это отмечают и профессионалы – сбылась мечта его детства. Он также выступал как исполнитель. Это фактически был его дебют на эстраде. У него прекрасный голос.</p>
<p>Потом он плавал на белоснежной яхте по Неве и каналам города, любуясь его красотой, был в Эрмитаже. Был также в кафешке, дружески пообщался с одним  из поклонников, они договорились о новой встрече. В общем, освоился в Питере) Сколько он здесь был – неизвестно, журналисты потеряли  его) он словно растворился в сумраке белых ночей… Но это же Питер, он всегда славился своей мистикой. Сейчас опять белые ночи, которые напоминают о нем…</p>
<p>Любимым писателем Джонни является Федор Достоевский. А его любимый роман – «Записки из мертвого дома», который раз прочитав, никогда невозможно забыть. Джонни очень хотел побывать в местах Достоевского, побродить по улицам, где он ходил… Но в этот раз не успел. Значит, вернется.</p>
<p>Джонни считают одним из самых известных книголюбов на планете. Он одновременно может читать четыре – пять книг. Часто его можно видеть с книгой. А если он заходит в книжный магазин, друзьям его можно уже не ждать – это часа на два. Джонни говорит, что он – буквоед.</p>
<p>Основная черта Джонни – это интеллектуальность, «он почти  совершенство» - так говорил о нем знаменитый Марлон Брандо. Красота Джонни – это в большей степени красота внутренняя, духовная. Красивых людей много, но он резко выделяется  среди них.</p>
<p>Сам он красавцем себя никогда не считал. Зеркала он старается избегать по мере возможности. Свои фильмы он вообще не смотрит. Он говорит – что увидел свое лицо на весь огромный экран… Это оказало на него сильное влияние) То есть, он с трудом выносит себя, в отличие от своих поклонников. Когда его в принудительном порядке привели на просмотр фильма с его участием, ему стало физически плохо, в общем, фильм он не посмотрел, ему было не до того… С тех пор его больше не зовут на просмотр его фильмов, но подтрунивают над этим.</p>
<p>Свою красоту Джонни старается всячески скрывать, он не то, что стесняется ее, но и это, видимо, есть - она мешает ему. Он не может наблюдать за людьми, что нужно ему для работы. Потому что, как он говорит – они наблюдают за мной. Также он опасается, и часто не зря, что в фильмах смотрят на его внешность, а не на его игру. Поэтому его фильмы надо смотреть как минимум два раза), чтобы почувствовать всю мощь его актерского дарования.</p>
<p>Режиссер и друг Джонни Тим Бертон говорит, что по какому-то странному стечению обстоятельств природа поместила большого художника, трудягу, очень скрупулезно работающего над своими ролями в «тело мальчика с плаката», что ему совершенно не нужно, и что только мешает ему. К тому же при вызывающей внешности природа наделила его просто удивительной застенчивостью, что еще больше усиливает интерес к его застенчивой персоне, отличающейся редкой красотой) Вот и вышел такой странный и загадочный Джонни Депп)</p>
<p>Жизнь Джонни складывается очень сложно. Он говорит – я ложусь спать в стрессе, сплю в стрессе и просыпаюсь в стрессе. Джонни очень нуждается в поддержке и помощи своих поклонников, к которым он относится со всей своей любовью и которых  считает своей семьей.  </p>
<p><strong>А теперь сообщение о судебных делах Джонни, которые, к сожалению, оставляют желать лучшего. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Эмбер Херд устраивала оргии с Карой Делевинь и Илоном Маском в доме Джонни Деппа</strong></p>
<p>""Еще одна звездная персона оказалась втянута в разбирательство между Джонни Деппом и Эмбер Херд. Ей стала Кара Делевинь.</p>
<p>По данным, полученным благодаря показаниям Джоша Дрю, бывшего мужа подруги Херд, и который вместе с женой бесплатно проживал в пентхаусе Деппа, стало известно, что Эмбер Херд, Илон Маск и Кара Делевинь устраивали оргии в пентхаусе Деппа. По сообщениям, Делевинь могут привлечь к делу в качестве свидетеля.</p>
<p>Команда Деппа получила показания десятков бывших друзей и работников пары Депп-Херд, в их число вошел Джош Дрю, который был женат на лучшей подруге Херд Ракель Пеннингтон.</p>
<p>Юристы задали вопрос напрямую — что известно Джошу об оргиях Херд? Дрю оказался в курсе любовного треугольника Херд, об этом ему рассказала его бывшая жена Ракель. Джош обмолвился, что Херд оплачивает его адвоката, однако с самой актрисой он общался в последний раз в прошлом году.</p>
<p>«Она [Ракель] рассказывала вам, что Эмбер, будучи в браке с Деппом, проводила ночи с Делевинь и Маском одновременно?» - спросил адвокат. Джош ответил: «Да. Не уверен, что в этот конкретный день». «Так вы подтверждаете, что они провели ночь все вместе?» - продолжает адвокат. «Как я понимаю, да», - отвечает Дрю.</p>
<p>Херд встречалась с Маском в течение нескольких лет, однако сам Маск утверждает, что роман между ними случился после развода звездной пары. Депп же предоставил записи с видеокамер в лифте жилого комплекса, где находятся его апартаменты, на видео Маск и Херд поднимаются поздно ночью в апартаменты Деппа. Это произошло в 2015 году, пока пара все еще была в браке. Суд направил повестку Маску в прошлом году.</p>
<p>Депп хочет знать, что именно рассказывала его бывшая жена космическому магнату о событиях мая 2016, когда произошел известный инцидент. <br>Делевинь не скрывает своих сексуальных предпочтений — девушка — бисексуалка. Она недавно рассталась со своей девушкой Эшли Бенсон, до этого ей Делевинь приписывали романы с Майли Сайрус, Гарри Стайлзом, Ритой Орой, Мишель Родригез, Джеком О'Коннеллом и Пэрис Джексон.</p>
<p>Впервые девушку упомянули в этом деле в 2016 году, когда в прессе появилась информация, что Депп «сходит с ума» и подозревает Херд в интрижке с британской моделью. Однако тогда информация не нашла подтверждения, хоть девушки и появлялись вместе на вечеринках.</p>
<p>DailyMail. com позднее получил фото Делевинь, которая поднималась все в том же лифте в апартаменты Деппа в 2016 году. <br>Консьерж Тринити Эспарза рассказала, что видела всех троих: «Я видела, как они поднимались, а затем спускались на лифте несколько раз. Сначала это была Кара, а за ней Илон и Эмбер. Они так и не смогли понять, какую кнопку нажать и отправились наверх по лестнице».</p>
<p>Представитель Делевинь пока не дал никаких комментариев. Илон Маск, в свою очередь, заявил изданию Page Six, что он «рекомендует перелистнуть страницу всем вовлеченным в процесс и двигаться дальше. Жизнь слишком коротка для такого негатива. Никому не хочется продолжать эту гонку в суде». Свою связь с Делевинь Маск отрицает.</p>
<p>Судебные слушания по делу Депп vs. Херд перенесли на следующий год из-за эпидемии коронавируса, в то же время второе дело - Депп vs. таблоид The Sun - получит развитие в суде уже в июле этого года"".</p>

<p>Сотрудница музея Маяковского Екатерина Мартон написала в инстаграме о Джонни Деппе, который, прилетев в Москву, чуть не с самолета приехал в этот музей: <em><strong>«Ущипните меня. Он только сегодня прилетел в Москву и одним из первых мест, куда он поехал это Музей Маяковского!!! Безумно добрый, тактичный, воспитанный, умный и самое главное совсем не пафосный».</strong> </em>А на следующий день у него был концерт...</p>
<p>Только в «Квартире на Большой Пресне» 27.05.2018 актер провел два часа. По словам Джонни, он был поражен ощущением близости и присутствия Маяковского в стенах музея. Обращаясь к коллективу музея, он написал: <em><strong>«Я был абсолютно поражён вашим гостеприимством и близостью к гению Маяковского. С уважением, Джонни Депп».</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>«Два-три раза я уже был в Москве, но не хватало времени ни на что, — только принять душ и бежать представлять фильм, — рассказывал Депп. — В этот раз у меня больше времени. Вчера я был в мемориальной квартире одного из моих любимых поэтов Владимира Маяковского — у него были страсть, драйв, много силы».</strong></em></p>
<p>Директор музея Алексей Лобов сказал: <em><strong>«Джонни Депп был в музее Маяковского и в 2013 году, до его ремонта. Актер отлично разбирается в русском авангарде, является большим поклонником Владимира Маяковского и вообще русского авангарда».</strong> </em>Джонни оставил благодарственную запись Алексею Лобову. Насчет фотографий Маяковского Джонни сказал, что они вызывают в нем даже большую близость духа по отношению к поэту.</p>
<p>«Послушайте!» - это стихотворение Маяковского является любимым стихотворением Джонни. И это шедевр мировой поэзии. В нем простыми и доступными словами сказано о поиске смысла жизни, о том, что невозможно жить без цели. Маяковский сравнил мечту со звездами, да так, что хочется посмотреть наверх и найти звезду, которая светит только для тебя…</p>
<p>Это очень сложный философский вопрос, на который невозможно ответить однозначно, сказав человеку: делай так – в этом смысл твоей жизни. Свою цель, мечту, свой путь каждый сам себе выбирает. Это очень созвучно Деппу.</p>
<p>Джонни также очень интересовался американской дочерью Маяковского - Патрисией Томпсон, которая посвятила свою жизнь изучению истории жизни своего отца. Он долго рассматривал фотографии.</p>
<p>Жизнь Маякровского была трагична, он покончил с собой в 36 лет...<br>Патрисия видела своего отца единственный раз в Ницце, когда ей было всего три года и навсегда запомнила этот день. Она написала 15 книг, в том числе ""Маяковский на Манхэттэне, история любви"". Ее уже нет в живых. Сын Патрисии - Роджер стал адвокатом. Он планирует выпустить книгу о жизни своей матери под кратким названием «Дочка». Думаю, что Джонни хотел бы с ним познакомиться, если этого уже не произошло...</p>","{'id': '224116954', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/wr/zv/tSwrZVuEHxmDTMR-800x450-noPad.jpg?1592772975', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against
25,StarterPetitionUpdate,27057218,2020-06-20T19:17:40.000Z,,Джонни Депп просит суд обязать Эмбер Херд предоставить полный доступ к ее медицинским документам.,"<p> </p>
<p>Джонни Депп просит суд обязать Эмбер Херд предоставить полный доступ к ее медицинским документам.</p>
<p>В частности адвокатов интересуют : 1) записи о медицинской и психологической помощи, оказанной Херд в связи с предполагаемым насилием, если таковые имеются; 2) данные, касающиеся ее лечения от алко- и нарко-зависимоcти; 3) сведения о ее психическом состоянии.</p>
<p>Сторона Деппа указала, что медицинские данные и сведения о психологическом состоянии мисс Херд напрямую связаны с правдивостью или ложностью ее заявлений о том, что она являлась жертвой домашнего насилия. Стоит отметить, что сама Херд ранее запросила и получила доступ к полным медицинским записям Деппа по судебному ордеру, но получив такой же запрос от Деппа, дала безосновательный отказ. Херд утверждала, что побои и психологическое насилие со стороны Деппа привели к физическим и эмоциональным травмам, поэтому ее медицинские записи или их отсутствие являются ключом в этом деле.</p>
<p>Как указано в документах, адвокаты Деппа безуспешно пытались добиться доступа к медицинским записям Херд с сентября прошлого года, делая запросы ее стороне на протяжении нескольких месяцев. Также указано, что в ходе телефонных переговоров с представителем актрисы 29 мая, сторона Херд предложила ”поверить”, что Эмбер сама предоставит те записи, которые по ее мнению относятся к делу, без полного доступа к ее документации.</p>
<p>Так например Херд указала, что она обращалась за помощью по меньшей мере к 6 медицинским специалистам, при этом предоставив лишь обрывки документов от двух из них.</p>
<p>Адвокаты актера отметили, что лишь полный доступ к медицинским данным Херд даст понять есть ли на самом деле хоть какие-то записи, подтверждающие заявления Херд о причиненных ей травмах, или же они полностью отсутствуют, что докажет ложность утверждений мисс Херд о том, что она подверглась домашнему насилию. Также эта документация имеет важное значение для дальнейшего допроса любого из указанных Херд медицинских специалистов, которые по ею утверждению знали о ее травмах.</p>
<p>Сторона актера попросила суд немедленно предоставить ордер, дающий полный доступ к медицинским записям Херд, так как эти сведения также являются критическими в деле Деппа против британского таблоида The Sun, судебное разбирательство с которым стартует уже 7 июля.</p>

<p><strong>Мы попытались разобраться на примере звездной пары, что удерживает супруга с токсичной половинкой</strong></p>
<p>Домашнее насилие в большинстве случаев ассоциируется с абьюзом в сторону женщины: нам представляется эдакий тиран, который держит в страхе свою жену. Однако, по статистике, мужчины страдают от проявления агрессии не реже женщин, причем не только в России. Один из самых известных скандалов на сегодняшний день, связанный с домашним насилием в сторону мужчины — дело о разводе Джонни Деппа и Эмбер Херд. Изначально девушка пыталась убедить общественность в том, что бывший муж не раз проявлял агрессию и вел себя по отношению к ней негативно, однако кроме своих слов девушка не может предъявить ничего. Тем не менее реакция общественных организаций не заставила себя долго ждать — Херд окрестили «голосом униженных и оскорбленных».</p>
<p>Поднялась нешуточная волна ненависти, направленная в сторону актера, которого все же поддержал весь Голливуд и абсолютно все бывшие девушки, которые, по идее, должны были сделать все, чтобы «насолить» эксу, тем не менее никто из них не мог поверить в обвинения.</p>
<p>Не вытерпев несправедливости в свой адрес, актер выступил с шокирующим заявлением: «Я жертва домашнего насилия» в одном из интервью, подкрепив впоследствии свои слова ужасающими фото отрезанного пальца, а также всевозможными справками от врачей, оказывавших Деппу медицинскую помощь. Как выяснилось, все увечья актер получил от бывшей жены: по словам очевидцев, давшими показания под присягой, Херд не раз пихала, обзывала мужа на людях, страшно представить, что творилось за закрытыми дверями. Судебное разбирательство назначено на февраль будущего года, однако уже сейчас, после того как вскрылась страшная правда, актер получает поддержку и извинения от людей, которые прежде считали его агрессором.</p>
<p>Как видно на примере пары Депп-Херд, мужчине потребовалось несколько лет, чтобы признаться перед всем миром в насилии в свой адрес со стороны женщины. Почему же сильной половине трудно об этом говорить? Попробуем разобраться.</p>
<p><strong>Основной блок, который стоит перед жертвой мужского пола — «А что скажут люди?»</strong> По определению мужчина не может быть слабее женщины, признание насилия в этом случае будет говорить о его несостоятельности в глазах общества и, самое главное — в глазах других женщин. Если учитывать современную моду на виктимблейминг, мужчину ждет нескончаемый позор, стоит лишь заикнуться, что женщина способна его подавить, хоть морально, хоть физически.</p>
<p><strong>Вторая опасность для мужчины — женщина подавляет его чаще всего морально.</strong> Это может быть невероятно эффектная женщина, которая приковывает к себе взгляды, как это было в паре Деппа и Херд, однако при общении наедине такие женщины делают все, чтобы разрушить самооценку партнера, тем самым привязав его к себе и не давая ему и шанса подумать уйти. Мужчине ломают психику и заставляют винить себя и только себя.</p>
<p><strong>Третья проблема свойственна, скорее, российским мужчинам, которые в лучшем случае уделяют внимание только физическому здоровью, игнорируя психологическое.</strong> Мы до сих пор не считаем депрессию опасным заболеванием, в то время как она ломает жизни сотен тысяч людей, вовремя не обратившихся к специалисту. Для мужчины давление со стороны жены или подруги зачастую становится нормой жизни.</p>
<p><strong>Признаки насилия со стороны женщины:</strong></p>
<p>- Постоянное употребление оскорбительных фраз и эпитетов в сторону мужчины, навязывание ему мнения, что он ничтожество и сам по себе бесполезен.</p>
<p>- Сравнение с другими мужчинами.</p>
<p>- Постоянные угрозы, пусть и в шуточной форме, что, на самом деле, не что иное, как проявление пассивной агрессии.</p>
<p>- Обесценивание.</p>
<p>- Игнорирование.</p>
<p>- Публичное высмеивание, перебивание на середине фразы.</p>
<p>- Измены.</p>
<p>- Шантаж.</p>
<p>- «Отзеркаливание» собственных пороков на партнера.</p>
<p>Конечно, без ссор невозможны никакие отношения, однако они не должны становиться нормой.</p>
<p><strong>Как поступить мужчине, который попал в «когти» женщины-абьюзера</strong></p>
<p>Во-первых, необходимо понимать, что это ненормально — вам наносят вряд, не важно, физический или моральный. Если у вас есть дети, агрессия, которую вы получаете в свой адрес, распространяется и на них. Поэтому принимать меры необходимо: если не работают разговоры, уходите и обратитесь к специалисту, если чувствуете, что ситуация вас не отпускает.</p>
<p>Как правило, мужчины, которые создают семьи с женщинами-агрессорами, делают это с оглядкой на свое детство: скорее всего, мужчина страдал от насилия со стороны матери. Вырастая в такой обстановке, мужчина в будущем ищет подобную женщину, чтобы почувствовать ту любовь, которую он испытывал к матери. Агрессия в этом случае не рассматривается им как негативное качество — ведь такой же была его любимая мать.</p>
<p>Помните, что никакие минуты радости и примирения не компенсируют то обращение, которое вы ошибочно принимаете за любовь.</p>

<p><strong>Сначала немного о Джонни Деппе...</strong></p>
<p>Тактильная чувствительность для ребенка играет огромную роль. Мама обнимет, погладит, поцелует - все это очень важно для его самоутверждения, правильного развития психики. Джонни практически был лишен всего этого. Маленькому мальчику казалось, что родители один или два раза в год любили его, и все. Казалось... По-видимому, поэтому для него очень важно иметь непосредственный контакт с человеком, который проявляет к нему положительные чувства. Он обнимет, прижмет к себе, погладит и т.д. И это взаимно. То есть, для него прикосновение играет очень большую роль, видимо, как компенсация того, что он недополучил в детстве...</p>
<p>Он отдает все свое тепло, всю свою любовь этому человеку... И делает это совершенно искренне, чем заслужил великую любовь поклонников своего творчества. Увидеть, услышать его, а тем более прикоснуться к нему - пожать руку, погладить по лицу, пока он занят раздачей автографов - для них это великое счастье. Джонни не зря пишет в конце своих обращений к поклонникам - со всей любовью и уважением - all love and respect. И это не пустые слова...</p>
<p>Индейское черное пламя Бушует в прекрасных очах,</p>
<p>Но он не поделится с вами, Весь мир свой в душе заключа.</p>
<p>Застенчивый, маленький, скромный, Он был возвеличен толпой,</p>
<p>С которой стремится быть ровней, Душевный, любящий, простой…LP</p>
<p>Джонни называет себя маленьким, потому что не считает себя выдающимся человеком,  он говорит - я не звезда)</p>
<p><strong>Никогда, ни при каких обстоятельствах такой человек, полный любви к людям, не может быть абьюзером. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Теперь, собственно, сообщение <em>Адвокат Эмбер Херд выходит из дела Депп vs Херд  </em></strong></p>
<p>Команда Эмбер Херд несет потери в лице главного адвоката: Роберта Каплан, сооснователь Time's Up и представитель интересов Эмбер Херд в деле Депп vs Херд, разорвала контракт с актрисой и больше не работает с ней по данному судебному делу.</p>
<p>Как стало известно изданию The Blast, Каплан и несколько других адвокатов стороны ответчика уведомили судью, что они выходят из дела, заявив, что Эмбер уже в курсе и не против такого решения своей юридической команды. Согласно документам, «Роберта Каплан, Джон Куинн, Джули Финк и Давида Брук отправляют запрос судье с просьбой отстранить их от должности представителей Эмбер Лоры Херд в данном судебном разбирательстве».</p>
<p>В данной ситуации Эмбер Херд получит нового адвоката в штате Вирджиния, где проходит суд — новым адвокатом актрисы стала Элейн Бредехофт. Как уже говорилось, Херд одобрила решение бывшего адвоката: «Мисс Херд не возражает против отвода своего представителя».</p>
<p>Представитель самой Каплан прокомментировал ситуацию: «Мы верим Эмбер Херд и верим в ее успех. Это была честь представлять ее в суде. В этих странных обстоятельствах, с которыми столкнулся мир, появились проблемы с логистикой, перемещения стали обходиться намного дороже, поэтому мы приняли решение передать ведение дела местному адвокату в Вирджинии».</p>
<p>Однако адвокат Джонни Деппа не верит в указанную причину: <br>«Годами Time's Up и другие движения работали вместе, продвигая ложь Эмбер Херд. Адвокаты мисс Херд, один из которых — сооснователь Time's Up, внезапно «выпутываются» из клубка обмана. Мы собираемся выяснить, в чем причина».</p>

<p>Юридическая команда актера запросила всю документацию и переписку, которую Эмбер Херд предположительно имела с ACLU (Американским союзом защиты гражданских свобод) и детским госпиталем Лос-Анджелеса, касаемо пожертвований, сделанных после развода пары. Похоже, адвокаты всерьез заинтересованы, какую сумму на самом деле отдала Херд, и кто являлся источником этих денег.</p>
<p>Согласно новым документам, попавшим в распоряжение The Blast, адвокаты Деппа хотят получить от обеих организаций всю информацию об их отношениях с Херд: документы, касающиеся устного или письменного общения между Херд и представителями организации , включая личные беседы, телефонные звонки, письма, е-мейлы, смс переписку, факсы, отчеты и любые другие документы, подтверждающие или относящиеся к их общению.</p>
<p>В частности, адвокаты запросили всю документацию, которая содержит отсылки, отражает или имеет отношение к любым пожертвованиям в пользу вышеуказанных организаций, сделанных мисс Херд с 1 января 2016 года и по настоящее время.</p>
<p>В 2016 году Джонни Депп и Эмбер Херд договорились, что частью бракоразводного соглашения станет получение Херд 7 миллионов долларов, с условием, что все деньги будут пожертвованы на благотворительность.</p>
<p>В то время Эмбер заявила, что ”как и указывалось ранее, деньги никогда не имели и не имеют для меня большого значения, за исключением возможности пожертвовать их на благотворительность, и жервуя их сейчас, я надеюсь, что они помогут тем, кому труднее всего защитить себя.""</p>
<p>Вскоре после объявления Херд, что деньги пойдут на благотворительность, Депп заявил, что отправит деньги напрямую этим организациям от ее имени. <br>После чего Херд с насмешкой заявила, что ”ценит недавно проявившийся интерес Деппа к поддержке ее двух любимых благотворительных организаций”, и что его пожертвование является ”замечательной и неожиданной новостью”, но категорически отклонила предложение Деппа о прямой передаче денег организациям, так как это изменяло условия их соглашения.</p>
<p>”Если Джонни желает изменить условия соглашения, нам придется настоять, чтобы он пожертвовал сумму в 14 миллионов долларов, что после получения налогового вычета, будет равняться 7 миллионам, которые по соглашению он и должен выплатить Эмбер,” - говорились в заявлении.</p>
<p>В конце концов Херд была указана в списке спонсоров детского госпиталя Лос-Анджелеса за 2017 год среди тех, кто пожертвовал или обещал пожертвовать сумму от 1 до 5 миллионов долларов.</p>
<p>Но похоже адвокаты актера, ставят под сомнение пожертвования Херд и хотят узнать кто именно внес свой щедрый вклад.</p>
<p>Адвокат Джонни Деппа, Адам Вальдман дал свой комментарий порталу The Blast:</p>
<p>”Эмбер Херд утверждала, что пожертвовала миллионы Джонни Деппа ACLU, где друг мисс Херд, Илон Маск, по чудесному совпадению является одним из крупнейших спонсоров. ACLU не только опубликовали открытое письмо мисс Херд на своем сайте, помогая продвижению ее обмана с насилием против мистера Деппа, они также вместе с Херд работали над составлением этого письма. А затем, по непонятной причине, ACLU безуспешно пытались стать участником процесса в деле мистера Деппа против мисс Херд. Мы имеем целую цепочку из вопросов без ответа, касаемо отношений между Эмбер Херд и ACLU. Сейчас мы надеемся докопаться до самой сути этих вопросов.”</p>
<p>Как уже сообщалось ранее, в сентябре прошлого года ACLU отправили запрос в суд, с прошением выступить независимым консультантом по делу, с правом наблюдения за поступающей в суд информацией, итогами экспертиз или высказыванием мнения в спорных моментах. Это запрос вскоре был отклонен.</p>
<p>Сторона Эмбер Херд не дала комментариев.</p>

<p><strong>Марина Кардозо</strong></p>
<p>""Можно миллион раз спросить себя: Джонни – какой он на самом деле?</p>
<p>И в миллионный раз получить новый ответ.</p>
<p>Искренний, нежный, ласковый и покорный. Преступно отчаянный и немного опасный.</p>
<p>Ранимый и храбрый. Невинный и падший. Непростительно прекрасный ангел, прячущий лицо, словно квазимодо. Восстающий из пепла Феникс.</p>
<p>Магически потусторонний, запредельный и непостижимый, но до боли земной, родной и настоящий. Откровенный и таинственный. Его любовь – как хрустальный бокал – сверкающая и кристально чистая, но тонкая и хрупкая, и манит и ранит одновременно.</p>
<p>Маняще соблазнительный, смущенно опускающий взгляд и краснеющий от малейшей похвалы. Замкнутый и осторожный, но изумительно легко обнажающий сердце и щедро раздающий душу первому встречному.</p>
<p>Бесстрашно сражающийся в самом пекле Голливуда за вечные ценности и при этом фантастически гибкий, он каждый раз возрождается и выживает в этом кромешном аду шоу-бизнеса, оставаясь почти неуязвимым.</p>
<p>Его воля напоминает сильный и упругий индейский лук, с тетивой из бесконечно прочного нерва, с горящими стрелами духовной энергии, поражающими на любом расстоянии – даже самое каменное сердце.</p>
<p>Он видит мир восхищенными глазами ребенка, но за его плечами самый жесткий опыт, которого хватило бы на несколько жизней.</p>
<p>Грязь словно не пристает к нему. Даже вывалянный в золе и перьях, он сияет как новенький золотой слиток. Чистый Гений и облитый помоями шут.</p>
<p>Актёр, продающий себя каждый день, и философ, стоически верный своим принципам.</p>
<p>Подвижный и изменчивый, без конца меняющий облики, переливающийся как сверкающая капля дрожащей ртути, готовая мгновенно принять любую форму.</p>
<p>Оттенки роскошнейшей палитры его эмоций выражаются в микронах.</p>
<p>Он – само воплощение красоты, каким-то парадоксальным образом соединяющей в себе аристократическую утонченность, классическое изящество и живую, природную грацию дикого зверя.</p>
<p>Шокирующее никогда не выглядит в нём чем-то инородным или излишним.</p>
<p>Сотканный из самых несовместимых и вопиющих противоречий...</p>
<p>Вечно нарушающий и создающий каноны, но всегда настоящий …""</p>

Америка очень нас выручает! Спасибо огромное изданию THE BLAST и  нашим американским друзьям! И всем тем, кто подписывает и распространяет эту петицию! Джонни, мы с вами!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</em></strong> Нет, мы даже сменим тему. Давай поговорим о твоей мальчишеской поре. Какое твое самое раннее воспоминание?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Ловля светлячков. Красивые, захватывающие насекомые. По соседству жила маленькая девочка, у которой была скоба на ноге. В ту ночь, когда астронавты высадились на Луне, мы с ней играли на качелях, и вот пришел ее отец и сказал очень серьезно: «Когда человек оставит свой след на поверхности Луны, Луна обагрится кровью». Я был шокирован. Я помню, как подумал: черт, мне шесть лет и это немного глубоко для меня. Я остался и смотрел на Луну. У меня была огромная вера, что ничто на ней не изменится.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ</strong><strong>:</strong> </em>У тебя был дядя-проповедник, не так ли?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Да. Это дало мне странное чувство религии. Он был театрален на кафедре. Он начинал плакать, восхваляя Господа. Вскоре взрослые начинали кричать «аллилуйя», падали на колени и ползли вверх, чтобы поцеловать его ботинки. Я не купился на это. Я не говорю, мой дядя был полон дерьма, потому что он хороший парень. Я просто не хотел дуальности – видеть его ведущим себя нормально дома и совершенно иначе на кафедре. Это было слишком удобно. Почему Господь ударяет в тебя только в церкви? Почему он не ударяет вас в ванной или когда вы делаете хот-доги?</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong></em> Мальчиком ты думал о грандиозных вещах? Хотел ли ты стать кинозвездой?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> В четыре или пять лет я мечтал быть Мэттом Хелмом, шпионом, которого сыграл Дин Мартин. Еще я хотел быть Флинтом – Джеймсом Кобурном. Эти парни получали всех женщин.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong></em> Ты бывал на чем-то помешан ребенком?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> Я сейчас помешан. Я конечно не пойду и не начну спрашивать у всех вокруг: «Хей, правда это здорово?» Так никогда не было, и наверное не будет.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Тебе нравится твое имя? Это отличное имя для кино, но ребенок наверное больше хотел бы быть Джонни Джонсом.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Это порождало клички. Я был Джонни Дип. Собачка Деппити. Диппити-Ду. Я не возражал против них, но я никогда не задумывался об этом, пока они не спросили меня на первом фильме, на какое имя мне выписывать накладную. Джон Депп? Это звучало раздуто. Я всегда был Джонни.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong></em> Ты был ребенком, когда твоя семья переехала из Кентукки в Миримар, Флорида.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Мы переезжали как цыгане. С того времени, как мне было пять лет, и до моего подросткового возраста мы жили в 30 или 40 разных домах. Это наверное очень связано с моим постоянно переезжающим образом жизни сейчас. Но я вырос именно так, поэтому я не думал, что в этом что-то ненормальное. Там где семья – там дом. Мы жили в квартирах, на фермах, в мотелях. Потом мы снимали дом, и одним вечером мы переезжали из этого дома в дом по соседству. Помню, я нес по двору свою одежду и думал: как же это странно. Но зато это очень легкий способ переезда.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Ты был хулиганом? Бил когда-то кого-нибудь?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Парни, с которыми я тусовался в подростковом возрасте, были хулиганами, поэтому я немножечко хулиганил тоже. Мне это не нравилось – дразнить кого-то, третировать людей. Это меня злило, и я сразу же вставал на сторону пострадавшего.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Тем не менее, ты ненавидел школу.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> Я не учился. Мне казалось, что учителя находятся там для того, чтобы убить восемь часов своего времени и получить за это зарплату. Гораздо больше мне нравилось играть на гитаре. Я играл с группой в ночных клубах в раннем возрасте, это и было моим образованием.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong></em> Сколько тебе было, когда ты потерял девственность?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> Мне было около тринадцати, я играл на гитаре в клубе, а эта девочка, которая была немного постарше, постоянно зависала и слушала нас. Она тоже была девственница. В тот вечер мы просто ужинали там. Это было в фургончике нашего басиста, в синем «Форде». Я знал, что нужно делать – я изучал этот предмет в теории годами. Я помню, как мы смеялись, здорово проводили время. Это сладкое, очень сладкое воспоминание. Она стала моей девушкой на какое-то время, а потом мы утратили контакт. Я давно ее не видел, около 19 лет.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Тебе было 15, когда твои родители разошлись. Тебя потрясло это?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Это было не ко времени. Это было слишком большой травмой для моей мамы.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Бетти Сью – ее имя на сердце – это тату на твоей левой руке.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Она буквально заболела. Жизнь, которую она знала на протяжении 20 лет, закончилась. Ее партнер, ее муж, ее лучший друг, ее любовник - просто оставил ее. Я был сломлен, когда он ушел, но когда ты сталкиваешься с чем-то вроде этого, удивительно, сколько надругательств на самом деле могут перенести человеческие ум и сердце. Ты просто принимаешь то, что тебе нужно принять. Конечно, иногда я думал: погоди-ка минуту, что случилось с моей семьей? Как насчет стабильности и безопасности дома? Но эти мои чувства были вторичны относительно мыслей о моей маме. Я сфокусировался на том, чтобы она смогла пережить это, что она в конце концов и сделала, и теперь все в порядке. И я даже в хороших отношениях с моим папой.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Временами тебя посещали различные страхи.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>О, да. У моей сестры Кристи родился ребенок, когда мне было 17. И я тогда впервые узнал о внезапной детской смертности. Ужасным было то, что это было необъяснимо. По какой-то непонятной причине ребенок мог перестать дышать во сне. И я подкрадывался к колыбельке, где малышка спала, и клал в колыбель руку, брал ее маленький пальчик, и так спал на полу. Это было глупо, я уверен. Но я думал, что тепло моей руки может помочь ей вспомнить как дышать, если что.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Ты очень чувствителен.</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Полнейший параноид.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Ты оставил школу в то время. Остальные Деппы пытались отговорить тебя от этого?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong> </em>Нет, они очень поддерживали меня. Но были другие люди, друзья семьи, которые сочли, что я дерьмо. Они говорили, что я пытаюсь им что-то доказать, оставляя школу чтобы играть на гитаре в ночном клубе. И я подумал, что может быть они правы. Моим основным чувством, когда я оставил школу, была незащищенность. Что-то вроде: а какого хрена я собираюсь делать дальше? Я никто. Я дебил, как подсказывали мне внутренние голоса. Я всерьез подумывал присоединиться к солдатам морской пехоты, потому что я не хотел быть дебилом. Я думал, что если я присоединюсь к солдатам морской пехоты, то я научусь иметь дело с авторитетом, и возможно смогу быть нормальным парнем.</p>
<p><em><strong>ПЛЭЙБОЙ:</strong> </em>Отчего же ты не коротко стриженный полковник Депп сегодня?</p>
<p><em><strong>ДД:</strong></em> Потому что моя музыкальная группа имела некоторый успех.</p>

<p>Джонни Депп не только один из самых талантливых актеров современности, но и, наверно, самый стильный мужчина в мире. Его индивидуальность наилучшим образом проявляется в вещах, которые он носит. Он - бродяга, хиппи, бунтарь, хулиган, пират: и все это в одном лице. Джонни Депп - самобытен, неординарен и неповторим.</p>
<p>Мистер Депп может надеть на себя вещи, которые уже давно вышли из моды, и при этом выглядеть архи стильно. Но его особенная любовь - это старые, поношенные и дырявые предметы гардероба, многие из которых он носит с 80-х годов. <br>Джонни Депп готов смешивать стили и экспериментировать бесконечно: за это его по праву можно назвать мужчиной в стиле бохо, ведь «творческий беспорядок» - это его девиз.</p>
<p>Мода для этого актера - это повод сделать вызов всему обществу, а в частности, купающемуся в роскоши Голливуду. На красных ковровых дорожках различных фестивалей и премий всеми любимый Капитан Воробей (он же Депп) предстает в совершенно ошеломляющих нарядах. Вместе со смокингом он надевает поношенные и вытертые ботинки Red Wing , которым уже далеко за 20. Или дополняет свой костюм шляпой федорой 1988 года выпуска, заношенной до такой степени, что на месте залома появилась дырка и не одна. Или приходит в любимых драных джинсах и кожаной куртке, совершенно забыв о дресс-коде.</p>
<p>Отдельно надо сказать о любви Деппа к различным аксессуарам. Он носит не только фенечку, сплетенную его дочкой, но и массу других украшений. Он обязательно носит очки авиаторы с синим стеклами, но не для того, чтобы уберечь глаза от солнца, а просто так (немного ошиблись). Обматывается тонкими длинными шарфами и платками, использует их вместо галстуков, прикрепляет их к джинсам и брюкам. На шее Деппа всегда много бижутерии: бусы, кулоны, подвески. На руках напульсники и перстни. А пряжку ремня Депп носит на левый бок.</p>
<p>На каждый день Депп выбирает следующие вещи: мешковатые пиджаки, надетые поверх классического жилета, из-под которого торчит джинсовая рубашка, свободные старые рваные джинсы. Если он не надевает своей «древней» обуви, то дополняет свой лук (look - вид) с помощью ботинок на платформе. Обаятельный пират души не чает в мятых клетчатых рубашках, тельняшках и простых майках.</p>
<p>Шляпы Депп чтит не хуже Безумного Шляпника: у него их, наверно, целая гора. Не только рваная федора становится главным головным убором, но и всевозможные кепки и кепи, ковбойские и широкополые шляпы, шапки-носки, огромные вязаные береты.</p>
<p>Изюминка стиля Деппа в том, что он создает его сам, без стилистов и дизайнеров, скупая вещи в винтажной лавочке Kakkoii Mono и комбинируя их по своему желанию. Он никогда не был поклонником какого-то бренда и не увешивался вещами одной марки. Его гардероб – отражение его характера и взгляда на жизнь. А для Деппа главное - свобода и самовыражение. Его стиль - бохо, довольно неординарное решение.</p>
<p><a href=""HTTP://ONLYBEAUTY.INFO/IKONA-STILYA/83-STIL-DZHONNI-DEPPA.HTML"" rel=""nofollow"">HTTP://ONLYBEAUTY.INFO/IKONA-STILYA/83-STIL-DZHONNI-DEPPA.HTML</a></p>
<p>Следует добавить, что яркая и вызывающую внешность Джонни Деппа, очень  контрастирует с его застенчивостью и сдержанностью, манерой тихо говорить, волнуясь и смущаясь, как ребенок, что делает его еще более привлекательным. Но он всячески старается скрыть свою застенчивость - отсюда экстравагантные поступки, как считают. Возможно, этому же в определенной степени служит и его неповторимый стиль - смотрите на что угодно, только не на меня)</p>
<p>И еще уточнение об очках Джонни Деппа.<br>Некоторые считают, что это элемент его имиджа. Ничего подобного. Джонни с детства вынужден был носить очки из-за неизлечимой болезни глаз, которая прогрессировала, это с его слов. Поскольку от перепадов освещения при вспышках фотоаппаратов, софитов и т.п. у него болела голова, он стал носить черные очки. Однако, врач посоветовал ему носить очки с цветными стеклами, которые больше сглаживает перепады освещения. Поэтому Джонни часто бывает в цветных очках.</p>
<p>Без очков он видит только на расстоянии нескольких см. А все остальное видит ""очень, очень размыто"", и то только одним глазом. Другим видит, как он говорит, как летучая мышь, правда, сейчас показано, что эти мышки все-таки видят. Когда Джонни без очков, охранники следят, чтобы он не упал, наткнувшись на невидимый для него предмет. А на съемках падал, он входит в шестерку самых травмируемых звезд. По этой причине Джонни хотел уйти из кино... Но Джонни борец, и для него ничего невозможного нет.</p>","{'id': '223872790', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/pz/xp/ybPzxpdQdMtVkTY-800x450-noPad.jpg?1590868483', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

Патти Смит — крутая. Настоящая. Игги Поп — крутой. Джим Моррисон был крутым и искренним. Марлон Брандо, Хантер Томпсон. Знаете, только сегодня я говорил с одним парнем, он работает с детьми с ВИЧ. С детьми, которых забрали из приюта. Это так похвально, помогать людям таким образом. Он настолько меня впечатлил, что мы обнялись. Я давно работаю с фондом Make-A-Wish и тоже общался с этими детьми. У них нелегкая судьба, они вынуждены бороться с серьезными болезнями и болью. Но в их глазах нет страха, только смелость и отвага. Вот, что круто. Считаю ли я себя крутым? Не знаю, почему меня таковым считают, возможно, это из-за моей сдержанности.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Этим летом Вы отправляетесь в тур вместе со своей группой Hollywood Vampires. Какое место в Вашей жизни занимает музыка?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Музыка — это все. Даже в моей работе. Я подхожу к работе актёра так же, как к работе музыканта. Я берусь за дело, учусь, слушаю. Когда я учился играть на гитаре, я слушал очень много записей, тем самым натренировав слух, поэтому я хорошо различаю оттенки и нюансы человеческого голоса — тембр, акцент, сила. В детстве я изображал разных людей и здесь мне очень пригодился слух. Я постоянно пользуюсь этим в работе. Мне кажется, все мы слышим саундтрек в голове время от времени. В некоторых сценах мне помогает музыка. Если я хочу воспроизвести в памяти какую-то ситуацию, чувство, либо показать что-то, песни моментально возвращают меня туда. Определённые песни приносят воспоминания. Моя память отсортирована музыкой. Поэтому я так часто использую музыку.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Что в Вашем понимании означает слово «мужественный»?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Настоящий мужчина тот, кто держит слово. Быть мужчиной, значит быть честным, преданным и надежным. Он должен бороться с несправедливостью, неважно — локальной или же в глобальном смысле. Настоящая мужественность — не бояться идти по жизни, даже если вокруг ничего нет. Быть искренним и надежным.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Вы уже во второй раз работаете с Dior, в образе, созданном Жан-Батистом Мондино, есть что-то от реального Джонни Деппа?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Когда Жан-Батист смотрит на вас, то как будто препарирует взглядом: снимает слой за слоем, пока не найдет что-то интересное. Так ему удается схватить в человеке что-то очень важное. Вот, например, волк — он ведь не случайно там появляется. Волк — по природе своей одиночка, и какая-то часть меня действительно стремится к одиночеству. Всегда стараюсь избегать больших скоплений людей.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Вы больше одиночка?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Мне нравится оставаться в стороне. Я чувствую себя лучше в тени. Жан-Батист Мондино сразу это понял. Я скромный человек. Что интересно, когда я в образе, для меня нет никаких преград. Я могу сделать что угодно перед камерой. Это довольно странно, чувствовать себя увереннее в образе перед камерой, чем в реальной жизни. Если меня попросят встать и сказать тост на празднике... Для меня это будет катастрофа! Перевоплощаясь в персонажа, я попадаю в другой мир. Жан-Батист ухватил во мне то, о чём я не люблю говорить в отношении себя, и не хочу, чтобы меня относили к этой категории. «Звезда», «выдающаяся личность» и всё такое, не хочу иметь к этому отношения.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Как Вы думаете, Мондино привнес какую-либо Вашу роль в рекламную кампанию? С каким из Ваших героев Вы здесь ассоциируетесь?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Нет, такого нет. Знаете, что самое главное? Актёр должен не играть, а проживать. В этом вся суть. Но самое сложное — быть естественным. Просто таким, как есть. Это не игра. Я нашел это состояние в себе, и Мондино снимал слой за слоем, чтобы найти то, что его заинтересует. Я согласен с его выбором. Мне позволили быть непосредственным участником и я благодарен за это. Мы ничего не планировали, не усложняли и не выдумывали ничего необычного. Просто его видение того, как свет должен падать на горы. Он профессионал. Честно, мне доставило больше удовольствия сниматься пару дней в пустыне, чем в большинстве фильмов. Здесь все естественно.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Кого бы Вы хотели сыграть? Может, исторического персонажа или нашего современника? Или того, кто Вас вдохновляет?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: О, да, есть люди и книги, которыми я восхищаюсь. Меня интересуют и выдуманные персонажи. Например, из книги «Над пропастью во ржи». Но никто и никогда не должен увидеть Холдена Колфилда на экране. Пусть он живет в воображении читателей и остается таким, каким его изобразил Сэлинджер. Есть просто великие люди. Например, Пикассо. Такую грандиозную личность невозможно показать в кино, лучше даже не браться. Или «В дороге» Керуака. Эта книга была моей библией в детстве, да и сейчас очень много для меня значит. Но мне никогда не приходило в голову, что по ней можно снять фильм. Фильм, который все же по ней сняли, я не смотрел, хотя с режиссером Уолтером Саллесом знаком, - он прекрасный парень. Но ведь главный герой Сэл Парадайз — это же Джек Керуак! Невозможно представить на этом месте никого другого. Иными словами, есть такие прекрасные люди и книги, которые лучше не трогать.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Кто из голливудских икон Вас вдохновляет?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Несомненно, меня вдохновляли деятели кино и телевидения. Различные комики, шоумены, актеры, певцы. Среди них Чарли Каллас, Дон Риклз, Фостер Брукс, который прекрасно изображал пьяницу, Дин Мартин, Марлон Брандо, Юл Бриннер. Эти люди были без сомнения личностями, для меня это много значит.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Они ни за кем не повторяли. Они делали то, что делали, тем самым выделяясь на фоне остальных. Новое поколение и следующее за ним, они не считают нужным учитывать этот факт, те люди действительно выделялись, сейчас все хотят просто быть знаменитыми. Но зачем им это нужно?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Я не знаю и для меня это неважно. И всегда было неважно.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: Ваш самый знаменитый персонаж — капитан Джек Воробей. Насколько это весело, играть такого героя? Он похож на Вас?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Играть такого человека, как Джек Воробей, который может сказать все, что угодно, даже если в его словах нет смысла, а затем пытаться придать им значение, что еще больше запутывает, и при этом выйти сухим из воды... Это странно. Когда я играю Джека Воробья, я постоянно улыбаюсь. Просто быть в его шкуре — уже смешно. Он может делать и говорить что угодно. «Привет, цыпа!» - он может быть ужасно бесцеремонным. Мы с ним абсолютные противоположности. Я тоже могу быть нахальным, но не настолько. Я всегда был стеснительным. Стать капитаном Джеком Воробьем, найти его в себе, стать раскованней, быть нелогичным и чуть дерзким, творить невероятные вещи — этому эксперименту нет конца.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: А Вам случалось писать что-то для собственных персонажей?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: Я уже много лет переписываю свои слова. Иногда сценарий очень красив на бумаге, но на съемках становится понятно, что многое не годится, потому что люди так не разговаривают. Поэтому я часто переписываю какие-то куски, а для роли Джека Воробья вообще все пишу сам. Кроме того, я давно перестал читать ремарки в сценариях. Не хочу заранее знать, где я должен стоять и что должен делать в кадре, - все должно само родиться на площадке.</strong></p>
<p><em>GQ: По какому принципу Вы выбираете фильмы, где будете играть?</em></p>
<p><strong>Джонни: По-разному. Обычно после первых десяти страниц сценария или трех-четырех страниц. Но, как правило, — десять страниц. После этого я понимаю, моё или нет. Я соглашаюсь только тогда, когда понимаю, что буду полезен для фильма, смогу привнести что-то своё. То, чего никто не делал до меня. Вот и всё. Если меня что-то заинтересовывает, я представляю это у себя в голове. Первая мысль — лучшая мысль. Керуак считал также. И Хэмингуэй. Когда его спросили, как стать хорошим писателем, он ответил: «Всё, что нужно сделать — написать предложение». Казалось бы - все просто, если бы не было так сложно на практике"".</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear The Blast!</strong> Thank you so much for supporting Johnny Depp and our petition! Many Americans see petition on your site and actively sign it.</p>
<p><strong>Dear American friends!</strong> We apologize for publishing the updates in Russian - we are not very fluent in English very well to quickly make a literary translation.</p>
<p>Уважаемый The Blast! Спасибо вам огромное за поддержку Джонни Деппа  и нашей петиции! Многие американцы видят петицию на вашем сайте и активно подписывают ее.</p>
<p>Дорогие американские друзья! Приносим свои извинения за то, что обновления публикуем на русском языке - мы не очень хорошо владеем английским, чтобы быстро делать литературный перевод.</p>
<p><strong>Почему Джонни называют ангелом?</strong></p>
<p>«Ангелами называют  детей, потому что они чисты и невинны, у них нет грехов. В детстве у Джонни был друг – его дедушка, который был чистокровным индейцем из племени чероки. Джонни очень любил своего дедушку, его кончина оказала негативное влияние на психику маленького Джонни, который стал печальным и страдающим ангелом.</p>
<p>В 12 лет мама купила ему недорогую электрогитару. Его мама работала, не покладая рук, с утра  до вечера, чтобы прокормить четверых детей. Но видела, что Джонни плохо кончит, если ему не помочь. Он был очень одинок, ребята дразнили странного замкнутого подростка, ни одна девчонка не хотела с ним встречаться. Он чувствовал себя полной бездарью, не способным ни на что.  </p>
<p>Гитаре его спасла. С 12 до 14 лет он серьезно занимался музыкой, сам научился играть на гитаре. Он был так занят этим, что не заметил, как он сам говорит, полового созревания. В этот период перестраивается не только организм, но и психика подростка. Это в норме, а психика Джонни не успела перестроиться, он не повзрослел, потому что слишком был увлечен музыкой…</p>
<p>Никому не нужный, он бросил школу, ушел из дома, превратился фактически  в уличного мальчишку, работал чернорабочим, пытался также заработать деньги игрой на гитаре.</p>
<p><strong>Он не знал, что такое хорошо, и что такое плохо, никто его этому не учил, книги он вообще не читал, в школе он учился мало.</strong> Получилось так, что он прошел через все  плохое, что только возможно. Такой путь был ему предназначен. Пил, курил, чуть не погиб от передозировки наркотиков.</p>
<p><strong>К счастью, природа наградила Джонни блестящим умом.</strong> Своими большими печальными глазами он начал более внимательно присматриваться к окружающей его странной жизни. И он увидел и понял, что кроме плохого в жизни существует и хорошее.</p>
<p>Джонни не мог больше продолжать прежнюю жизнь, он понял, что это означало для него гибель. Достичь хорошего было гораздо сложнее, но он выбрал именно этот путь. <strong>Отныне все хорошее стало для него маяком, светочем, освещавшим всю его жизнь.</strong></p>
<p>Джонни стал много читать, наверстывая упущенное. <strong>Он стал одним из самых известных книголюбов на планете, настоящим ""книжным червем"", как он  говорит.</strong> Самый любимый писатель его - Федор Достоевский. Джонни учился актерскому мастерству у актеров немого кино. Он незаурядный гитарист, гитаре он никогда не изменял. Он поет, у него прекрасный голос, пишет картины…</p>
<p>У Джонни все чрезмерно. Доброта его зашкаливает, любовь к людям не знает границ, как и  готовность помогать тем, кто нуждается  в помощи. Но все-таки не за это его называют  ангелом, <strong>а за то, что став взрослым, Джонни сохранил свою детскую ангельскую душу, он остался вечным ребенком…</strong></p>
<p>Возможно, отчасти поэтому он переживает, когда его называют секс-символом, говорит, что он даже в кино не играет любовников, это не его… «Я думаю, что если бы мы сделали сценарий, в котором Капитан Джек по-настоящему влюбился бы, то это был бы немой фильм. Я думаю, он впал бы в кататонический ступор и не смог бы говорить. Он бы сидел все время и вот так бы вот дрожал мелкой дрожью полтора часа...""</p>
<p>Вероятно, из-за особенностей своего характера Джонни трудно найти свою вторую половинку. «В кругу красивых девушек, я теряю дар речи» - говорит он. Такое бывает - от волнения перехватывает дыхание, и человек не может говорить.</p>
<p>Но самая большая проблема этого большого ребенка, этого ангела, в том, что <strong>он боится быть обманутым,</strong> как это было с Эмбер Херд. Что могут любить его деньги, а не самого Джонни со всеми его странностями, его застенчивостью и с чистой детской душой, человека не из нашего мира…» L.P.</p>
<p>«Ниспошли, Господь, любви такой святой, <br>Чтоб ангелы о ней стихи писали, <br>И чтобы даже ветры замирали, <br>Любви моей коснувшись неземной. <br>Пошли, Господь, добра и простоты, <br>И снега, чтоб был белым и пушистым. <br>Чтоб грешный мир стал наконец-то чистым, <br>Пошли всем грешным душам чистоты…»</p>

35,StarterPetitionUpdate,26686289,2020-05-20T18:06:55.000Z,,Интересная статья!  Интервью к фильму «Что гложет Гилберта Грейпа»,"<p><em>Потрясающий дуэт Джонни Деппа с Леонардо ДиКаприо.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ден Якир: А присутствует ли идеал для вас в роли Гилберта Грейпа?</strong></p>
<p>Джонни Депп: Да. При поверхностном взгляде на Гилберта, он может показаться симпатичным, вполне нормальным парнем. Но я был заинтересован тем, что происходило глубже, у него в душе, той враждебностью и яростью, которая накопилась в нем, и которую он имеет возможность показать только пару раз в фильме. Я понимаю его чувства, которые обречены застрять на одном месте, без права сойти с него. Тут есть два аспекта: географический (Гилберт с семьей живет в неприметном американском городишке) и эмоциональный. И я могу понять ярость, смешанную с желанием убежать от всего этого, от всех и каждого, чтобы начать СВОЮ новую жизнь. !</p>
<p><strong>Он кажется симпатичным грустным парнем…</strong></p>
<p>Мне кажется, Гилберт в некотором роде позволил себе умереть. Это медленный вид самоубийства. Он мучит себя ради семьи, становясь отцом даже для своей матери. Эта доброта и лояльность ко всему, возможно, зарождается как чистая любовь, но со временем она начинает работать против тебя. Любовь и преданность превращается в негодование и чувство вины. А также человек теряет себя, что является наихудшей вещью, которую кто-либо может сделать, поскольку тогда вы ненавидите других, из-за того, что сделали с собой. !</p>
<p><strong>Так что, фактически, фильм о нас, грустно теряющих себя.</strong></p>
<p>-Да, но он оптимистичен в том, что эта девушка появляется в его жизни и предоставляет Гилберту очень простую, очень прямую информацию о том, как можно жить. И его раковина, в которой он жил многие годы затрещала по швам. Он начал исправлять ошибки, совершенные ним. В жизни мы стремимся оценить людей резко, сразу же по их появлении, не взвешивая все «за» и «против». И если этот человек, к примеру, уродлив, или его восприятие мира иное, чем у тебя, от него зачастую просто отворачиваются. Иногда их называют фриками, потому что они другие. Во многих фильмах присутствуют люди, которые похожи на кого-то, есть и такие, которые отличны ото всех. В кино все это интересно и увлекательно, роль наблюдателя любопытна. Но в жизни все совсем по-другому. Когда я впервые встретился с Дарлен Кэйтс, то не акцентировал внимания на ее размерах, увидев ее привлекательное лицо и эмоциональные глаза. Тогда я подумал, что она очень красива и что она весьма храбрый человек. Не всякий сможет так показать свою личную жизнь в фильме перед всем миром, а тем более, если раньше ты этого никогда не делал. !</p>
<p><strong>Касательно Эда Вуда, фильмейкера, которого вы сейчас играете. Вуд назван наихудшим режиссером в мире и…</strong></p>
<p>Я думаю, вы должны быть Богом, чтобы говорить что хорошо и что плохо о том, кто, очевидно, создавал что-либо честное и был верен себе. Эд был парнем, который остался оптимистичным и делал свои фильмы тогда, когда ему говорили, чтобы он их не делал. Он их снимал и выпускал, когда ему говорили, что он не должен их снимать и выпускать. Он жил своей собственной внутренней жизнью, пусть даже это была жизнь гетеросексуального трансвестита. !</p>
<p><strong>Вы во второй раз работаете с Тимом Бертоном.</strong></p>
<p>Да. И это большая удача. Тим – потрясающий человек. Мне кажется, он чем-то похож на Эда Вуда. Такой же забавный и уверенный в себе, хотя его работы не всегда понятны зрителю. Он любит фильмы ужасов, Вуд тоже любил их. Я согласился на эту роль сразу же, как только Тим обрисовал мне свою идею. Это новый опыт и большая ответственность – играть реального человека. !</p>
<p><strong>Вы можете назвать себя фриком?</strong></p>
<p>Да, безусловно. Я чувствую себя отстраненным от мира только потому, что в нем слишком много ненависти… Ненависти и жадности… Я попросту не чувствую подобной жадности и не испытываю столько ненависти, сколько в мире является нормальным. Так что фрик – это как раз про меня. !</p>
<p><strong>Вы, кажется, говорили, что были в гнетущем положении, работая над Гилбертом Грейпом.</strong></p>
<p>Это было тяжелое время для меня. Только мое душевное состояние во многом помогло в творческом плане. Я пробовал убежать от моего собственного мозга. Я не знал, что было правильно, и в чем я ошибался. Не знал, кем я был, и кем не был… Я очень запутался. Я не знал, сделал ли подсознательно себя жалким. Моему герою это было нужно, но я боялся и сам навечно застрять в том ЕГО времени, которое он уже перестал даже замечать. Я много пил. Я регулярно отравлял себя. Но покончил с этим в течение последних пяти месяцев. !</p>
<p><strong>Мне кажется, это хороший момент, чтобы спросить о Ривере Фениксе…</strong></p>
<p>Он был великим актером и великим человеком; большое человеческое существование… У него была большая семья, очень ровный образ жизни и многообещающее будущее. И эта моя ссора с прессой… Они могли сказать: «Послушайте, он был нормальным парнем, который просто не смог управиться с самим собой, запутался и сделал ошибку. Такую же фатальную ошибку мог бы совершить любой из нас. Присматривайте за собой!» Но никто этого не сказал. !</p>
<p><strong>Вы думаете, что пресса была…</strong></p>
<p>Невероятно безответственна! Эта тема долго муссировалась. Много журналистов играли детективов на задворках и эксплуатировали ситуацию, чтобы получить рейтинги и продавать свои газеты и журналы. Таблоиды занимались полной беллетристикой. Это действительно трагично и грустно, но никто этого не замечал. Сколько раз надо было прокрутить в эфире запись звонка в службу спасения? Сколько раз надо было напечатать обо все этом в газетах? Каково было брату Ривера жить среди всего этого? Это невероятно безответственно. Мы превращаемся в общество санитарных преследователей. Каждый сосредоточивается только на плохом. Хорошее не интересует никого! Разве проблема с наркотиками появилась только сейчас? Где были СМИ в течение прошлых 20 лет? Эта наркотическая «эпидемия» с годами развивается все больше и больше. Они снабжают людей этим и потом с них же спрашивают. Но если бы не было поставок – не было бы и спроса. Наркотики – это огромный бизнес. !</p>
<p><strong>В полицейских заключениях было сказано, что наркотические препараты были найдены повсюду в «Viper Room».</strong></p>
<p>Я работаю в этом бизнесе 10 лет. И что, они хотят сказать, что я открыл ночной клуб, чтобы позволить людям принимать наркотики даже в туалете? Они думают, что я сумасшедший? Думают, что я готов отбросить все, даже будущее моих еще народившихся детей только ради того, чтобы кто-то мог закинуться наркотиками в ночном клубе? Это смешно! ДЯ: Вы играете на сцене «Viper Room». Разве вы хотите быть рок-звездой? ДД: Я думаю об этом только как о возможности повеселиться вместе с друзьями, не как о второй карьере. Это хорошо – быть вовлеченным в какие-то другие области. Я бы не хотел быть только актером на протяжение всей своей оставшейся жизни. !</p>
<p><strong>Почему музыка лучше, чем актерство?</strong></p>
<p>Это путь создания чего-нибудь здесь и сейчас. Совсем не похоже на четыре месяца, необходимые для съемки фильма. Музыка для меня подобна живописи, где каждый мазок берет свое время. Музыка настойчива, а ощущения приятные – это хороший способ бегства от реальности. !</p>
<p><strong>Вас назвали Королем Фриков. Джонни Депп когда-нибудь сыграет нормального человека?</strong></p>
<p>Я действительно удачлив. Люди заметили, что мне нравится исполнение нетривиальных ролей в странных фильмах, но я удачлив в том смысле, что не отношусь к списку актеров, распределенных по принципу типажности. Это очень важный фактор, который позволяет меняться. Существует много красивого материала, но меня может подкупить только изнанка. Настоящим художником может быть только тот, что воспринимает себя настолько серьезно, что может дать себе волю притворяться. Но притворство часто болезненно. Я думаю, что у каждого есть своя боль и актеру совершенно не обязательно иметь ее больше, чем всем остальным. Нужно просто делать то, что тебе близко. !</p>

36,StarterPetitionUpdate,26669833,2020-05-18T20:38:10.000Z,,Как фанаты спасли карьеру Джонни Деппа ,"<p>Индейское черное пламя <br>Бушует в прекрасных очах, <br>Но ты им не делишься с нами, <br>Весь мир свой в душе заключа. <br>Стеснительный, маленький, скромный, <br>Ты был возвеличен толпой, <br>С которой стремишься быть ровней - <br>Душевный, любящий, простой... L.P.</p>
<p>""У одного из самых ярких актеров Голливуда красавчика Джонни Деппа не всегда все было радужно и безоблачно. Так, его карьера однажды оказалась на грани краха.</p>
<p>Случилось все, как водится, из-за женщин. Точнее, как выяснил ""Рамблер"", из-за одной женщины, с которой у главного пирата кинематографа случились отношения и даже брак. </p>
<p>Так, болезненная любовь Деппа и молодой актрисы-биссексуалки Эмбер Херд. Именно с ней Джонни закрутил роман, когда расстался с Ванессой Паради после 14 лет отношений.</p>
<p>Сногшибательная блондинка вскружила голову опытному ""Безумному шляпнику"", но держала его на коротком поводке. Многие считали, что Эмбер лишь позволяла Деппу себя любить и манипулировала им, угрожая расставанием., Именно так ей удалось получить заветное предложение руки и сердца.</p>
<p>Актер тратил на новую жену огромные суммы, старался угодить ей и с трудом (серьезными вложениями) возвращал свою взбалмошную блондинку после каждого ухода. Причем она зачастую уходила к женщинам. </p>
<p>Причем, любовь Деппа сделала Херд знаменитой и помогла получить заветные контракты от журналов и киностудий, а вот на Джонни отношения влияли пагубно. Коллеги и пресса заметили, что актер стал хуже выглядеть, набрал лишний вес, вернулся к вредным привычкам и начал на нервах срывать съемки.</p>
<p>Это все продолжалось 15 месяцев, пока Херд не подала на развод, потребовав ежемесячные алименты в 50 тысяч долларов. Такие алименты ей получить не удалось и девушка решила испольовать ""козырь"", обвинив Деппа в домашнем насилии.</p>
<p>Как известно, американская публика крайне негативно воспринимает любые намеки о домашнем насилии или рукоприкладстве в отношении женщин.</p>
<p>Обычно пресса моментально подхватывает слухи о тирании и начинает порицать обвиненную звезду на каждом шагу, припоминая ему все грехи. Естественно, что такая новость разрушила бы карьеру даже самого любимого актера, отвернув от него миллионы фанатов.</p>
<p>Но только вот капитан Джек Воробей каким-то чудом избежал подобной участи. Вместо ожидаемых обвинений на актера обрушилась колоссальная поддержка. Деппа поддержали коллеги, кинокомпании, друзья и, самое главное, фанаты.</p>
<p>Зрители не ""съели"" суперзвезду, а буквально вытащили  его из приближающегося краха и депрессии, ведь в момент разрыва с Херд у него еще и умерла мать.</p>
<p>Фанаты в один голос высказывались в поддержку актера, в Сети публиковали целые меморандумы о том, что Депп не виновен, а Херд просто строит из себя жертву. Никто не закидывал Джонни помидорами и не писал о том, что он оказался тираном. И это помогло.</p>

<p>""ДЖОННИ ДЕПП считает, что он был мишенью одной из крупнейших медиа-компаний в Великобритании, что привело к тому, что его телефон был взломан и в его частную жизнь вторглась в течение почти десяти лет. <br>По данным источников, близких к ситуации, звезда “Пиратов Карибского моря "" возбудила судебное дело против газеты News Group в форме искового письма. News Group Newspapers является британской дочерней компанией американской News Corp. и управляет таблоидом The Sun, а также ныне несуществующими Новостями Мира. <br>Депп обвиняет таблоиды в ""многочисленных нарушениях"" его частной жизни и ""неправильном использовании частной информации, включая незаконный перехват его голосовых сообщений и другой незаконный сбор данных"". <br>В письме Депп объясняет, что его команда провела обширное расследование этого дела и считает, что телефон актера был взломан в период с 1996 по 2010 год. В результате расследования были получены доказательства, которые “явно указывают на неоднократное и длительное незаконное вторжение"" в его личную жизнь. <br>Из многих ""неправомерных разоблачений"" его личной жизни Депп утверждает, что таблоиды украли информацию о его тогдашних маленьких детях и медицинскую информацию. <br>В течение этого периода времени Депп утверждает, что Солнце раскрыло общественности NNboth беременностей его подруги, NN сначала в 1998 году, а затем снова в 2002 году. Он обвиняет газету в том, что она использовала обложку его ""приятелей"" для объяснения того, как им удалось собрать секретную информацию. <br>""Эти детали были явно навязчивыми и деликатными и включали в себя этапы беременности, передвижения и планы нашего клиента (демонстрируя явное наблюдение за ним)"", - говорится в юридическом письме. <br>Депп объясняет, что таблоид раскрыл подробности тяжелой болезни его тогдашней 7-летней дочери, которая привела ее в больницу. Актер говорит, что инциденты, связанные с этими конкретными статьями “ "" заставили его чувствовать себя наиболее разгневанным и оскорбленным.” <br>В последующие годы Депп рассказал о госпитализации дочери Лили-Роуз Депп в 2007 году по поводу почечной недостаточности и о том, что это был один из самых мрачных моментов в его жизни. И Депп, и тогдашняя подруга Ванесса Паради оставались у постели своей дочери во время 9-дневной госпитализации, в которой Лили-Роуз лечилась и успешно выздоровела. <br>Оглядываясь назад на то, как эта новость освещалась в 2007 году, команда Деппа объясняет, что репортеры: <br>- мы знали, что дочь нашего клиента находится в ""тяжелом состоянии"", название больницы, в которой она лечилась, и характер ее болезни. Они также знали о мерах, принятых нашим клиентом для защиты частной жизни его и его семьи, включая вход в больницу через служебный вход и скрытное передвижение.” <br>Депп говорит, что открытие того, что его телефон якобы был взломан, и особенно то, что его дети были подвержены этим действиям, “глубоко повлияло на него. ""Актер утверждает, что оглядываясь назад через статьи с новым знанием того, как была получена информация, заставляет его вновь пережить “гнев, насилие и беспомощность”, которые он чувствовал в то время. <br>Борьба между Деппом и газетами News Group ожесточенна, поскольку звезда “Пиратов Карибского моря“ ранее подал судебный иск против британского таблоида о клевете за то, что ранее он называл его ""загонщиком жен"".- Это дело направлено в суд и продолжается. <br>Депп непреклонен в том, что он инициировал это новое дело не ради “финансового вознаграждения”, а из “принципа"". Депп сказал, что он хочет ""защитить свою семью, добиться справедливости за совершенно неоправданное зло, которое (компания) еще не полностью признала, и раскрыть правду о том, что произошло.” <br>Что касается того, что он хочет, Депп просит компанию признать свою тактику сбора информации для статей, появляющихся в Sun, особенно в отношении беременности его двумя детьми и статей о болезни его дочери. <br>В письме Депп просит компанию признать свои ""неправомерные действия"", а также просит суд предписать прекратить любую будущую практику перехвата его информации. <br>В ответ на его судебный иск адвокат Деппа Адам Уолдман рассказывает о взрыве: <br>""Вчера мы отправили уведомление в The Sun о нашем намерении подать иск против них за незаконный взлом телефона Джонни Деппа. Наш адвокат Дэвид Шерборн представлял интересы принцессы Дианы, а также Элтона Джона, Джуда Лоу, Хью Гранта и принца Гарри в хакерских исках против Солнца. The Sun выплатила десятки миллионов фунтов стерлингов, чтобы урегулировать десятки незаконных хакерских исков по одной причине-потому что они это сделали. Это дело для мистера Деппа - дело принципа, а не денег.” <br>Попытки связаться с NGN для получения комментариев оказались безуспешными"".</p>
<p>NGN - мультисервисная сеть нового поколения - L.P. <br>Перевод: Яндекс с небольшой моей правкой, sorry! извините! Просто не всегда хватает времени) Но содержание понятно. Бедный Джонни! Какую муку он должен вынести... L.P.</p>
<p>Кто теперь скажет, что для Джонни не нужна Госохрана, что его охранники справляются? Американцы сразу смекнули), что к чему, и бросились подписывать петицию за создание Госохраны для Джонни. Ведь при ее наличии такое безобразие вообще исключено. Его вообще могут уничтожить с этой ЭХ с огромными связями, не дай Бог, если мы не будем за него серьезно бороться. L.P.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp Accuses UK Tabloids Of Hacking Into His Phone</p>
<p>""JOHNNY DEPP believes he was the target of one of the largest media companies in the UK, which resulted in his phone being hacked and his privacy invaded for almost a decade. <br>According to sources close to the situation, the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star has initiated a legal case against News Group Newspapers in the form of a letter of claim. News Group Newspapers is a British subsidiary of the American-owned News Corp. and operates the tabloid, The Sun, as well as the now-defunct News of the World. <br>Depp is accusing the tabloids of ""multiple breaches"" of his privacy and ""misuse of private information, including the illegal interception of his voicemail messages and other unlawful data gathering. <br>In the letter, Depp explains that his team has conducted an extensive investigation into the matter and believes the actor’s phone was hacked between the years 1996 – 2010. The investigation resulted in evidence that “clearly points towards repeated and prolonged illegal intrusion"" into his private life. <br>Of the many “wrongful disclosures” of his private life, Depp claims the tabloids stole information about his then-young children and medical information. <br>During the time period, Depp claims The Sun revealed NNboth of his girlfriend's pregnancies to the public,NN first in 1998 and then again in 2002. He accuses the newspaper of using a cover of his ""pals"" for explaining how they were able to gather the sensitive information. <br>""These details were obviously intrusive and sensitive and included the stages of the pregnancies, our client’s movements and plans (showing clear surveillance of him),"" the legal letter states. <br>Depp explains the tabloid disclosed details of his then 7-year-old daughter's serious illness, which landed her in the hospital. The actor says the incidents surrounding those specific articles “left him feeling the most angered and violated.” <br>In the years since, Depp has opened up about daughter Lily-Rose Depp’s 2007 hospitalization for kidney failure and how it was one of the darkest moments of his life. Both Depp and then-girlfriend Vanessa Paradis stayed by their daughter’s bedside during the 9-day hospitalization, in which Lily-Rose was treated and made a successful recovery. <br>Looking back at the way the news was covered in 2007, Depp’s team explains that reporters: <br>“were aware that our client’s daughter was in a ‘serious condition,’ the name of the hospital where she was being treated, and the nature of her illness. They also knew of measures taken by our client to protect his and his family’s privacy, including entering the hospital through the staff entrance and traveling discretely.” <br>Depp says the discovery that his phone was allegedly hacked, and particularly that his children were subject to these activities, has “deeply impacted him.” The actor claims looking back through the articles with the new knowledge of how the information was obtained, is forcing him to relive the “anger, violation and helplessness” he felt at the time. <br>The fight between Depp and News Group Newspapers is bitter, as the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star has brought legal action against the UK tabloid before with a libel claim for previously labeling him a “wife-beater.” That case is headed to trial and ongoing. <br>Depp is adamant that he initiated this new case, not for “financial reward” but out of “principle.” Depp said he wants to ""to protect his family, to seek justice for a wholly unjustifiable wrong which (the company) has yet to fully admit, and to uncover the truth about what went on.” <br>As for what he wants, Depp is asking the company to admit its tactics in gathering information for articles appearing in The Sun, specifically in relation to the pregnancies of his two children, and the articles regarding his daughter's illness. <br>In the letter, Depp is asking for the company to admit its “wrongdoing” and is also asking the court to order a halt on any future practices of intercepting his information. <br>In response to his legal action, Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, tells The Blast: <br>“Yesterday we sent notice to the Sun of our intention to file suit against them for illegally hacking Johnny Depp. Our Barrister David Sherborne has represented Princess Diana, and also Elton John, Jude Law, Hugh Grant, and Prince Harry in hacking claims against the Sun. The Sun has paid out tens of millions of pounds to settle dozens of illegal hacking claims for one reason – because they did it. This case is a matter of principle for Mr. Depp, not one of money.” <br>Attempts to reach NGN for comment have been unsuccessful"".</p>

<p>Открываются все новые обстоятельства по судебному делу Джонни Деппа, которые подтверждают его невиновность .</p>
<p><strong>Декларация.</strong> ""Я, Джош Ричман, заявляю: я совершеннолетний, я не принимал участие в описанных событиях. Я обладаю персональной информацией о произошедшем. <strong>Я являюсь другом Джонни Деппа на протяжении 33 лет.</strong> Я был гостем на свадебной церемонии на Багамах 7 февраля 2015 года. Это маленький остров, гостей было не так много.</p>
<p>Никто из присутствовавших друзей Джонни не был рад, что Джонни женится на Эмбер, мы открыто обсуждали этот момент. Общее мнение на этот счет, которое разделяю и я, однако, никто из нас не знал подробностей, было таково: Эмбер Херд проявляла эмоциональное насилие по отношению к Джонни, пыталась оградить его от друзей, была эмоционально жестока с ним. <strong>Он жил в страхе, что она может повести себя неадекватно, если он попытается с ней расстаться.</strong> Его семья, друзья и я тоже, всегда чувствовали, что он согласился на требование Эмбер жениться на ней, в большой степени из страха.</p>
<p>Я был свидетелем одного из инцидентов. Джонни рассказал нам, что в ночь перед свадьбой у них с Эмбер произошла ссора. Джонни сообщил, что Эмбер ушла в ванную комнату, и вернулась оттуда с платком с красным пятном на нем, этот платок хранится у него до сих пор. Эмбер Херд вылила на платок красный лак. Подобные инциденты, о которых его друзья слышали вскользь, заставляли нас усомниться в благополучии этого брака. Все, кто знает Джонни давно, и даже совсем недолго, могли заметить, что <strong>он всегда великодушен, добр и внимателен, всегда пытается удостовериться, что человеку комфортно, всегда готов помочь, и не терпит оскорблений чувств других людей.</strong></p>
<p>Я помню, Эмбер, ее сестра и друзья были навеселе или под действием наркотиков большую часть времени после свадьбы на острове. За день до свадьбы друг Эмбер Айо Тиллетт Райт жестоко обошелся с другой подругой Эмбер, Роки Пеннингтон: они поругались во время обсуждения деталей свадебной церемонии. Они казались детьми, которые дорвались до дорогой игры в свадьбу, оплаченную Джонни Деппом, которого буквально силой заставили жениться перед тем, как он улетит на съемки в другую страну. Почти все гости на острове слышали об этом инциденте. Все выходные, проведенные на острове, я общался с Айо, с которым мы неплохо ладили, чего нельзя было сказать об остальных друзьях Эмбер. После того как он избил Роки, я и еще несколько человек спросили у него, что случилось. Он рассмеялся и сказал, что Роки впала в истерику, когда начали обсуждать план свадьбы, начала плакать. Он был горд тем, что применил к ней насильственные действия. Айо смеялся и был невероятно горд собой.</p>
<p>Я дал Айо кличку, которая рифмуется с рэпером ASAP Rocky - «I Slap Rocky» - «Я бью Роки». Все гости называли его так все выходные. Айо нашел это смешным, ему понравилась кличка.</p>
<p>Я заявляю под присягой, как этого требует закон США, конкретно — штат Вирджиния, все вышеизложенное — правда.</p>
<p>Адвокат Джонни Адам Вальдман ответил на высказывание адвоката Эмбер Херд о том, что заявления друзей Деппа «неуместны и не изменят ход дела»:</p>
<p>«Адвокат Эмбер Херд посчитал неуместным, что один из свидетелей с их стороны проявляет насильственные действия к другому свидетелю с их же стороны. Она считает наличие испачканного лаком платка «неуместной утечкой». Кроме того, адвокат Херд считает, что горы видео, аудио, фотографии и свидетельские показания «не повлияют на факты, предоставленные в суд». Но ведь это и есть факты, предоставленные в суд по текущему делу».</p>

<p>""Я вырос в несчастной семье и знаю, как расходятся семьи. Этот опыт порождает у вас циничное отношение к жизни, он приводит даже к боязни пытаться создать прочные отношения"". Джонни был одиноким, угрюмым и крайне замкнутым ребенком с явными признаками невроза, с фобиями. Он был погружен в себя, интересовался только рисованием и музыкой - типичный интроверт, очень стеснительный. Окружающим он казался странным. «Ни одна девчонка не хотела встречаться со мной» - говорит Джонни.</p>
<p>Он был выходцем из  бедного, несчастного, кочевого детства – родители его постоянно переезжали с места на место в поисках лучшей жизни… Он пробовал наркотики - они были на каждом шагу – чтобы как-то скрасить свое полунищенское существование, также из любопытства, иногда его заставляли делать это, чуть не погиб от передозировки, употреблял алкоголь.</p>
<p>В юности Джонни Депп вел вольный образ жизни. Вскоре после развода родителей он ушел из дома, бросил школу.для того, чтобы полностью погрузиться в музыку. ""Это совершенно нормально, - говорит он. - Если в школе скучно, а дома нечего делать, начинаешь экспериментировать"". </p>
<p>Несовершеннолетний Джонни жил в машине приятеля, на еду зарабатывал чернорабочим - работал на стройке, заливал бензин, пытался заниматься ремонтом машин, брался, практически, за любую работу. А все свободное время посвящал рок-музыке.</p>
<p>Будучи подростком, он был бедно одет, был неухоженным и угрюмым. Иногда был вынужден воровать сэндвичи - от голода, был очень худой. Говорят, что он ввел в моду разорванные джинсы, но других у него, по-видимому, и не было... Возможно, поэтому у него так и осталась привязанность к старым вещам, на которые, может быть, и бомж не посмотрел бы. Как этот полудикий подросток, дитя улицы, смог превратиться в Джонни Деппа - кумира миллионов - понять не просто. Его путь к этому был крайне тяжелым.</p>
<p>Когда Джонни смог немного приодеться, причесал свои роскошные волосы и поднял свои большие печальные глаза, чтобы лучше разглядеть окружающий его странный мир, многие заметили, что он сказочно красив. Это было еще одним стрессом для него - на него стали смотреть, а застенчивые люди испытывают от этого чувство дискомфорта. Он старался всячески скрыть свою красоту, которую сам никогда не воспринимал...</p>
<p>Если бы в тот несчастный период жизни Джонни сказали, что через некоторое время он войдет в Книгу рекордов Гиннеса как самый высокооплачиваемый в мире актер, мультимиллионер - он бы ни за что в это не поверил... «Пройдя через всё плохое, что было со мной, я узнал, что значит хорошо. - Слишком просто обвинять других людей и обстоятельства в прошлом за твою собственную ненависть к себе» - говорит Джонни. Видимо, когда он оказался на краю бездны, Провидение сжалилось над ним... И послало ему актера Николаса Кейджа, с которым Джонни подружился и который разглядел в нем актера... Тебе терять нечего - иди в актеры - сказал Николас...</p>
<p>Заметила, что поклонники Джонни Деппа относятся к нему с особой нежностью и теплотой - жалеют за страдания, которые он перенес, и за те немыслимые страдания, которые он переносит сейчас, скрывая под улыбкой свои душевные невзгоды… Но иначе к нему относиться и нельзя... Он это знает и бесконечно благодарен своим поклонникам, к которым относится с искренней любовью и уважением, которых называет друзьями или родственниками, за помощь и сочувствие...</p>
<p>Дорогие друзья! Дорогой Джонни! С Праздником Великой Победы! Дорогой Джонни мы очень благодарны вам за выступления в соцсетях и такие теплые слова. Наши чувства взаимны!</p>

<p>У него есть враги. <br>У него есть друзья. <br>Он порой беззащитен – <br>Как ты или я. <br>Но случится – и дьяволу плюнет в лицо. <br>Это Ангел, он с черепом носит кольцо…</p>

<p>Марина Кардозо ""Просто"".</p>
<p>У Джонни Деппа индейские корни. В свое время индейцы являлись одним из самых развитых народов. У них уникальная и очень интересная культура, ее частью являются татуировки. Мужчины этого народа очень любили делать тату как проявление социального статуса или как оберег. Каждая тату имеет свой глубокий смысл. Индейцы были, а может быть, и остаются сильными магами.</p>
<p>Известно, насколько близки индейцы с природой, они умеют разговаривать с животными и общаться с растениями - до сих пор ходят такие поверья. И в их тату просочились изображения священных животных: волка, орла и пр. И Джонни неравнодушен к животным, почему-то он особенно любит летучих мышей, собаки тоже его постоянные спутники - с самого детства...</p>
<p>По мнению Джонни, тату на его коже - это еще и его личный дневник, в котором записаны основные события его жизни. Тату, в основном, на руках. На правой ноге тоже есть тату черепа с подписью: “Death is Certain” (смерть неизбежна), имеющая глубокий смысл. Я чертовски люблю жизнь - говорит Джонни, видя эту запись каждый день.</p>
<p>Браслеты, цепочки, перстни - это амулеты и обереги, в которые Джонни очень верит и никогда с ними не расстается. Среди них есть и индейские, которые, видимо, обладают большой силой. На сцену он не может выйти без них.</p>
<p>В России, в отличие от многих других стран, отношения к тату скорее негативное, потому что имеется устоявшееся мнение старшего поколения, что тату – это удел зеков; церковь не одобряет татуировки на теле (считается, что в России высокая религиозность населения), и сложившееся мнение о том, что тату являются признаком эмоционально незрелой личности. Но Россия всегда была особенной, и умом ее не понять...</p>
<p>Джонни: «Во мне течет кровь различного происхождения: ирландская, немецкая и индейская. Мой дедушка, с которым я был очень близок и который умер, когда мне было 7 лет, как раз чероки (индейское племя). В США практически каждый может похвастаться индейской кровью. В каких-то случаях это, действительно, правда.</p>
<p>И что я нахожу особенным в наличии индейской крови в чьих-то венах, это то, что, возможно, кто-то родился в результате невероятной жестокости. Возможно, кто-то из ваших предков стал жертвой резни, этих варварских деяний, и кто-то из них был изнасилован 150 или 200 лет назад.</p>
<p>Этот народ стал жертвой насилия, нападений, и по прошествии многих лет это насилие все еще живо в людском сознании. Вероятно, это объясняет жестокость в стране, которую никто не может унять. Я понял это не так давно, по прошествии какого-то времени после того, как сделал эту татуировку (голову индейца чероки в честь прабабушки чероки - Джонни сделал ее в 17 лет)».</p>
<p>Фото: Джонни с премией - в 2012 году он попал в Книгу рекордов Гиннеса как самый высокооплачиваемый актёр планеты. Его стабильный доход составлял сумму в 75 млн $. Он лучший, и в этом сомневаться не приходится, тем более, что эта Книга является документом, который зафиксировал самые огромные достижения в мире. Лучшим актером всех времен и народов Джонни Деппа можно смело назвать и без без его фиксированных рекордов.</p>
<p>Эмбер Херд нанесла очень существенный урон его состоянию, но главное - его карьере. Недавно у нее не стало мамы, ей было всего 63 года, подробности Херд не сообщает. Довела, возможно... Такое вытворять!

<p><strong>У Джонни Деппа было трудное детство.</strong> В семье было четверо детей, он самый младший. Мама с утра до вечера работала официанткой в кафе, детьми ей некогда было заниматься. Маленький Джонни явно скучал по ней. Он приходил в кафе и ждал ее, ждал, когда она закончит работу. Он всегда любил свою маму – самого близкого своего человека. Но она не всегда хорошо относилась к Джонни, отношения были сложные. Видимо, у нее, кроме усталости от однообразной работы, были свои проблемы, которые делали ее раздражительной и злобной, что она и срывала на маленьком Джонни.</p>
<p><strong>«Да, она била меня без причины. Иногда в твою сторону летит пепельница, иногда ты получал телефонной трубкой»,</strong> иногда она была «отъявленной стервой». Видимо, именно это послужило причиной его бессонницы. Джонни не мог спать от обиды, боли и унижения. Это страшно, когда ребенок так мучается… Чтобы заснуть, он вынужден был принимать снотворные. И днем он, явно, все время был в напряжении, в ожидании очередных побоев без причины… И некому было его пожалеть…</p>
<p>Когда Джонни исполнилось семь лет, не стало его любимого дедушки. Он почувствовал себя очень одиноким. С ним практически никто не говори дома. «Это был дом-призрак: никто ни с кем не разговаривал» - говорит Джонни.</p>
<p><strong>Джонни не очень ладил и со своими сверстниками. Он был очень застенчивый и замкнутый, очень стеснительный, таким он остался на всю жизнь.</strong> «Дика, печальна, молчалива, как лань лесная боязлива» - невольно вспоминаются слова Пушкина… Он раскрепощается только перед камерами, входя в образ своего персонажа, это для него своеобразная терапия… Ребята считали Джонни не вполне нормальным. Им было странно, что он избегает их, не идет играть с ними в футбол, вместо этого идет домой смотреть сериалы. Над ним издевались, его дразнили, били, называли «дип» - тронутый, переиначив его фамилию.</p>
<p>Однако, не смотря на сложные отношения со сверстниками, и особенно с мамой, Джонни не озлобился, наоборот, у него возникло особое отношение к людям: <strong>«Я всегда относился к людям, особенно к женщинам, так, как будто - я всё могу поправить».</strong> То есть, его отношение к людям, является только конструктивным, только добрым. Отсюда потребность Джонни помогать им. Если он видит человека, который не может или не хочет улыбаться, он заставит его сделать это, потому что считает необходимым поддержать его.</p>
<p>Природа, как бы для того, чтобы еще больше подчеркнуть своеобразие и непохожесть на других этого странного и застенчивого человека, наделила его сказочной красотой. Но не это главное в Джонни Деппе. <strong>«… Прежде всего, он чрезвычайно интеллектуален. Он почти совершенен»,</strong> как сказал о нем знаменитый актер Марлон Брандо, когда Джонни было около 30… Благодаря своему brilliant mind – блестящему уму он занял правильную позицию в жизни, нашел свой единственный путь в творчестве, хотя это и было очень сложно. И добился огромного успеха, стал гениальным актером, кумиром миллионов… Однако все имеет оборотную сторону. Он возбудил против себя злобу и зависть, что особенно обострилось в последнее время.</p>
<p>Дети, у которых было трудное детство, особенно которых били и унижали, часто при взрослении становятся жертвами насилия (абьюза), что и произошло с Джонни. Утверждаю это как профессионал, как доктор медицинских наук. Особенно ярко это проявилось в его отношениях с его бывшей женой Эмбер Херд. Этот год он провел в аду с настоящим дьяволом. В данном случае абьюз был психологический, эмоциональный и физический.</p>
<p>Психологический абьюз считается очень тяжелым. <strong>Адвокат Джонни Адам Вальдман говорит: «Эмбер Херд — серийный, жестокий абьюзер, как в отношении женщин, так и мужчин, который нагло оклеветал Джонни Деппа».</strong> Если будет доказано, что Джонни жертва абьюза, суд его оправдает. Для этого ОЧЕНЬ желательно иметь в команде психолога. Потому что очень сильно мнение, что мужчина не может быть жертвой насилия со стороны женщины, а она может. Но это мнение идет вразрез с наукой.</p>
<p>Чтобы сделать Джонни побольнее, Эмбер подала клеветнический иск в суд через несколько дней после смерти его матери, когда ему и так было очень тяжело, ведь он ее любил… А следующий клеветнический иск в суд она подала в прошлом году через несколько дней после смерти близкого и любимого друга Джонни, начальника его охраны, с которым он не расставался в течение 22 лет - Джерри Джаджа. И опять, чтобы причинить Джонни как можно больше боли…</p>
<p><strong>По ее вине Джонни несколько раз был на грани жизни и смерти, думал о самоубийстве.</strong> Потому что она – жестокий абьюзер, а он – жертва, он не мог поднять на нее руку - она женщина, поставить ее на место. Это может быть под силу только специалисту-психологу и то, если абьюзер осознает, что он им является и захочет стать обычным человеком. К тому же Джонни, как он говорит, всегда относится к людям, особенно к женщинам, так, как будто он все может поправить. Он делал все возможное для этого... Но с абьюзером это невозможно. Единственное спасение - бежать без оглядки от такого человека, хотя это очень сложно...</p>
<p>Абьзер никогда не оставляет свою жертву, продолжает постоянно преследовать ее, что и делает Эмбер Херд. <strong>Худшим исходом такого жестокого  абьюза может быть психическое заболевание, самоубийство или убийство жертвы.</strong> Тем более, что отец Эмбер Херд грозился пристрелить Джонни, слов нет! И у его любимой дочери тоже есть оружие, а она совершенно непредсказуема... И фанаты Эмбер желают смерти Джонни... Для него сложилась очень опасная ситуация. </p>
<p>Эмбер поднимает общественность и СМИ против Джонни, имеет в этом успех, <strong>тысячи идут за ней.</strong> Поэтому ей надо противодействовать, нас должно быть очень много, и мы должны быть очень сильными, иначе все это может иметь неблагоприятный для Джонни конец. Очень настораживает то, что очень замкнутый Джонни, совершенно закрытый, в относительно недавно написанной им песне попрощался со всеми…</p>
<p><strong>Поэтому надо очень и очень постараться, чтобы помочь Джонни. Он очень рассчитывает на своих друзей, то есть, своих поклонников. Если мы будем активно распространять эту петицию и соберем максимальное количество подписей, это СПАСЕТ ЖИЗНЬ ДЖОННИ, ЕГО ЗДОРОВЬЕ, ЕГО КАРЬЕРУ. Так постараемся ради любимого актера и прекрасного человека!!! И победа будет за нами!</strong></p>

<p>Впервые я написал о Деппе в конце 2019 года. Он готовился к изнурительной битве в зале суда со своей бывшей женой, Эмбер Херд. Если вы не знаете, почему, вот полная история.</p>
<p>Как и большинство людей моего возраста, 52 года, спасибо, что спросили, я вырос рядом с Джонни Деппом. Наше поколение наблюдало, как неуклюжий, но одаренный подросток расцветает в разностороннего и талантливого актера. На протяжении почти сорока лет Депп волновал, поглощал и развлекал нас, и он еще далек от завершения.</p>
<p>Телесериал 1980-х годов ""21 Джамп-Стрит"" сделал его имя нарицательным и разбил сердца девушек по всей планете. К тому времени, когда морально сомнительный, но привлекательный пират Джек Воробей появился в поле зрения ""Черной жемчужины"", Джонни Депп стал голливудской иконой. <strong>Его привлекательность носит глобальный характер и не зависит от языка или культуры.</strong> Если вы думаете, что я ошибаюсь, просто следуйте некоторым темам в Twitter.</p>
<p>Я провожу довольно много времени на платформе, изучая общее настроение населения в целом и ища материал для статей. Я заметил кое-что интересное в Джонни Деппе за последние несколько месяцев. Не сам человек, а его последователи или поклонники, которые во многом являются прямым отражением этого человека.</p>
<p><strong>Мы притягиваем к себе людей своей энергией, которую излучаем. Обычно эти люди-единомышленники......</strong></p>
<p>Однако поклонники Деппа переводят всю концепцию фэндома на другой уровень. <strong>Ничто не сбивает их с пути истинного.</strong> Только не Эмбер Херд и уж точно не наш надоедливый маленький соседский вирус. В разгар пандемии новость о новом аккаунте Деппа в Instagram распространилась по всему твиттеру. Даже глобальная пандемия не может ослабить их энтузиазм или лояльность.</p>
<p>Они не торопятся прощать и все еще нагромождают обвинения и осуждения на услышанное при каждом удобном случае. Хотя она доказала, что полностью заслуживает внимания, она должна пожалеть о том, что выбрала именно его палец, чтобы отрубить его. Из всех доступных пальцев, которые она могла бы выбрать, этот, оглядываясь назад, был не лучшим выбором.</p>
<p>Сам Депп очень мало говорит публично. Он редко говорит о своей личной жизни, и когда он это делает, его верные поклонники всегда готовы ухватиться за каждое слово. Там есть настоящая и неподдельная любовь, немного фанатизма и достаточное количество подобострастия, если вы являетесь членом Клуба Деппа.</p>
<p>Любой, кто высказывает критику Деппа, делает это с риском взбудоражить племя.</p>
<p><strong>Вопрос в том, почему? Что именно в Джонни Деппе вызывает такую любовь и непоколебимую преданность? Да, есть неоспоримый талант, красивая внешность и обаяние, но есть явно что-то еще.</strong></p>
<p>Мне нравилось наблюдать за Деппом на экране в течение многих лет. Есть подлинная мягкость и искренность, которая просачивается через многие его характеры, независимо от их недостатков или особенностей. Вы знаете, где-то глубоко внутри, что вы поладите с этим человеком, вы будете наслаждаться его обществом и ценить его дружбу.</p>
<p>Тот факт, что он приятен для глаз, также является ключевой частью пакета, о чем свидетельствует содержание многих твитов. <strong>Однако принципиальная разница между Джонни Деппом и его голливудской когортой, похоже, сводится к одному. </strong><br><strong>Скромность.</strong></p>
<p>Куда бы вы ни пошли, повсюду рассказывают о человеческой природе этого человека. <strong>Он скромен до крайности, непритязателен и не наполнен тем самовозвеличивающим высокомерием и претенциозностью, которые пронизывают Голливуд насквозь. </strong><br><strong>Депп - настоящий....</strong></p>
<p><strong>Черты, которые демонстрирует Депп, явно не предполагаются, но являются отражением заботливого, любящего и скромного человека, который скрывается за множеством лиц, которые он так удобно носит на экране.</strong> Разве он ущербен? Конечно, это так, но именно эта его часть, которую он так явно носит на рукаве, еще больше привлекает его поклонников.</p>
<p><strong>""Я такой же, - тихо говорит он нам своим поведением, - как и ты"". Это смирение вкупе с обильным талантом, возможно, было его величайшим достоянием и будет продолжать хорошо служить ему, когда он выйдет из действительно темного места в своей жизни.</strong></p>
<p>Он ни в коем случае не одинок. <br>По всему миру сотни тысяч страстно преданных и любящих поклонников стояли рядом с ним, держа зажженную свечу. Тот факт, что их вера в него была подтверждена, только укрепляет их решимость.</p>
<p><strong>Они, несомненно, сыграют важную роль в обеспечении того, чтобы Депп снова наслаждался полным блеском славы в центре внимания. Это будет вполне заслуженное и долгожданное возвращение.</strong> Мы будем пристально смотреть на горизонт в надежде снова увидеть черные паруса ""жемчужины"" с Деппом у руля. Ты же знаешь, что они говорят.</p>
<p>Вы просто не можете удержать хороший корабль внизу.</p>
<p><em><strong>What Exactly Makes Johnny Depp so Annoyingly Likeable? </strong></em><br><em><strong>Hint: It isn’t Captain Jack. Well, not exactly (оригинал статьи полностью)</strong></em><br><a href=""https://medium.com/lighterside/what-exactly-makes-johnny-depp-so-annoyingly-likeable-3a0746b597b9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/lighterside/what-exactly-makes-johnny-depp-so-annoyingly-likeable-3a0746b597b9</a><br><em><strong>Robert Turner Follow Apr 28 · 4 min read</strong> </em><br>I first wrote about Depp in late 2019. He was settling in for a gruelling courtroom battle with his ex, Amber Heard. If you don’t know why, here’s the full story. <br>Like most people my age, 52, thanks for asking, I grew up alongside Johnny Depp. Our generation watched an awkward, yet gifted teenager blossom into a versatile and talented actor. For nearly forty years, Depp has thrilled, engrossed and entertained us and he’s far from done. <br>The 1980’s television series, 21 Jump Street, made him a household name and broke girls hearts across the planet. By the time the morally questionable but lovable pirate, Jack Sparrow, sailed into view on the Black Pearl, Johnny Depp had become a Hollywood icon. His appeal is global and doesn’t rely on language or culture. If you think I’m wrong simply follow some of the threads on Twitter. <br>I spend quite a bit of time on the platform, sampling the general mood of the populace at large and looking for material for articles. I’ve noticed something interesting about Johnny Depp over the last few months. Not the man, as much as his followers or fans, who in many ways, are a direct reflection of the man. <br>We attract people to us by the energy we give off. Usually, these people are like-minded. The obese blonde buffoon currently occupying the White House is an excellent example. <br>Depp’s fans, however, take the whole concept of fandom to another level. Nothing puts them off their stride. Not Amber Heard and most certainly not our annoying little neighbourhood virus. In the midst of the pandemic, news about Depp’s new Instagram account was all over Twitter. Not even a global pandemic can dampen their enthusiasm or loyalty. <br>They’re not quick to forgive and still pile accusations and condemnation on Heard at every opportunity. Although she has proven herself completely deserving of the attention, she must rue the fact she picked ‘his’ finger to chop off. Of all the available digits she could have chosen, this one, with hindsight, wasn’t the best choice. <br>Depp himself says very little publicly. He rarely speaks out about his private life and when he does his loyal fans are there to latch onto every word. There is real and genuine love, a little bit of fanaticism and ample amounts of fawning involved if you’re a Club Depp member. <br>Anyone who voices criticism of Depp does it at the risk of stirring up the tribe. <br>The question is, why? What exactly is it about Johnny Depp that inspires such love and unwavering loyalty? Yes, there’s the undeniable talent, the good looks and the charm, but there’s clearly something else. <br>I’ve loved watching Depp on screen over the years. There is a genuine gentleness and sincerity that seeps through his many characters, no matter their failings or idiosyncrasies. You know, somewhere deep down inside, that you’d get on with this man, you’d enjoy his company and value his friendship. <br>The fact that he’s easy on the eye is also a key part of the package, as the content of many a tweet will attest to. The crucial difference though, between Johnny Depp and his Hollywood cohort, seems to come down to one thing. <br>Humility. <br>Everywhere you go, stories abound of the man’s humanity. He is humble to a fault, unassuming and not filled with the self-aggrandising arrogance and pretentiousness that permeates so much of Hollywood. Depp is the real deal.</p>
<p>He has remained intensely private, the unfortunate incident with Heard perhaps the only break from this pattern. He still enjoys the loyalty, friendship and support of his ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis and is widely acknowledged to be an attentive, loving and caring father. <br>Both Paradis and Depp’s daughter chose to speak out early against the claims of abuse levelled at the actor by Amber Heard. In 2016, Paradis had this to say about her partner of 14 years. <br>Johnny Depp is the father of my two children, he is a sensitive, loving and loved person, and I believe with all my heart that these recent allegations being made are outrageous. <br>The traits Depp displays are clearly not assumed, but a reflection of the caring, loving and humble man that lies behind the many faces he wears so comfortably on screen. Is he flawed? Of course he is, but it’s this part of him that he wears so obviously on his sleeve that endears him even more to his fans. <br>I am, he quietly tells us through his demeanour, just like you. This humility, coupled with abundant talent, have perhaps been his greatest assets and will continue to serve him well as he emerges from a truly dark place in his life. <br>He is by no means alone. <br>All across the world, hundreds of thousands of passionately loyal and loving fans have stood beside him, keeping the candle lit. The fact that their faith in him has been vindicated only serves to strengthen their resolve. <br>They will undoubtedly be instrumental in ensuring that Depp once again enjoys the full glare of fame’s spotlight. It will be a well deserved and much-anticipated return. We’ll keep our eyes firmly focused on the horizon in the hopes of seeing the Pearl’s black sails again with Depp at the helm. You know what they say. <br>You just can’t keep a good ship down.</p>

43,StarterPetitionUpdate,26504461,2020-04-29T21:02:53.000Z,,"Джонни Депп: ""Я никогда не хотел быть звездой""","<p> </p>
<p>Если бы мне не сказали, что он только что проснулся, я бы решил, что Джонни Депп готовится к роли какого-то бомжа. Длинные волосы с блондинистыми прядями, кажется, давно не видели ни мыла, ни шампуня. Небрежная одежда на грани полного износа. Цепочки, феньки и амулеты, которые на нем надеты, весят по крайней мере килограмм. И впечатление от всего этого – Депп слишком красив, чтобы в это можно было поверить. Даже если только часть слухов о его жизни правда, в свои 38 он выглядит удивительно совершенным, юным и живым.</p>
<p>Все фильмы Деппа – это непрерывная борьба с помощью грима, париков, бород и ужасных очков против статуса секс-символа, который он внезапно получил, играя в сериале «21 Jump Street». Все напрасно: он остался звездой. Не благодаря, а скорее несмотря на двадцать нестандартных кинофильмов, в которых он играл всяких лириков и маргиналов, снятых европейскими или независимыми кинорежиссерами. Некоторые из фильмов имели хорошие отзывы критиков, но ни один не имел кассового успеха. Исключением была «Сонная Лощина», его третий фильм с режиссером Тимом Бертоном. В свое время Депп отказался от «Скорости», «Легенд осени», «Трех мушкетеров» - ролей, которые превратили других актеров его поколения в больших звезд. Хотя у него есть квартира в Париже, он переехал в гостиницу на время промоушна пяти фильмов, в которых он снялся в прошлом году. Сказка «Шоколад» с Жюльетт Бинош уже в прокате. Скоро выйдут на экраны «Кокаин», «Человек, который плакал», «Пока не опустится ночь» и «Из ада». Этих фильмов могло бы быть и шесть, если бы съемки «Человека, который убил Дон Кихота», в котором он играл вместе со своей подругой Ванессой Паради, не были прекращены из-за непредвиденных осложнений.</p>
<p>Возможно, он еще не проснулся до конца. Несмотря на вызывающую одежду, он кажется чересчур застенчивым. Вынимая пачку табака, он шепотом спрашивает, позволим ли мы ему закурить.</p>
<p>- По-моему, я еще не читал ни одного интервью с Вами, в которых первый вопрос не касался бы курения.</p>
<p>- Обычно мне говорят, что все в порядке, пока я соблюдаю меру, однако я никогда не был способен что-то сделать в своей жизни, соблюдая чувство меры. Если люди что-то говорят мне по поводу моего частого курения в Лос-Анджелесе или Нью-Йорке, я думаю: Господи! Вы не возражаете против воздуха, которым вы здесь дышите, и при этом обвиняете меня за то, что я пытаюсь разогнать ваш смог. Что это, если не результат промывания мозгов?</p>
<p>Я не хочу воздерживаться от курения до тех пор, пока я не попаду в острую никотиновую зависимость. В Америке, если Вы только говорите о возможности закурить, Вам тут же норовят прочесть целую лекцию. Во Франции, когда Вы куда-нибудь приходите, Вам сразу же говорят – если Вы хотите курить, курите, пожалуйста. Вот это - то, что я называю гостеприимством. Разумеется, когда Ванесса была беременна, я приучил себя выходить с сигаретой в другую комнату. И сейчас, когда у нас дочь, мы выходим курить на улицу. Я стою там на холоде перед окном и смотрю, как она барахтается в комнате на ковре.</p>
<p>- Кажется, Вы стали более активны, с тех пор как стали отцом: Вы снялись в пяти фильмах в прошлом году.</p>
<p>- Правда? Мой агент продолжает твердить мне, что я работаю не слишком прибыльно. Это конечно смотря с чем сравнивать, но если вы увидите, сколько другие ребята зарабатывают в Голливуде, то я – просто болван.</p>
<p>Раньше я говорил – у меня нет никаких адресов, по которым мне можно слать сценарии, я в дороге. Было так трудно найти меня, что я удивляюсь, что у кого-то это вообще получалось. Но теперь, когда у меня есть семья, я должен зарабатывать на жизнь. Раньше деньги давали мне свободу, даже если это была свобода помогать другим, однако теперь я должен покупать еще и защиту.</p>
<p>Я не бизнесмен, я никогда не работал только ради денег и, даже если бы я имел их достаточно, я не перестал бы сниматься в кино. Я должен поддерживать свои мозги в активном состоянии, но я не хочу, чтобы съемки отнимали всю мою жизнь. Когда я не работаю, я стараюсь вообще не думать о голливудских делах. Если Вы хотите достойно и честно работать, и при этом еще и жить, Вы должны сохранять некоторую спокойную отдаленность. Роли приходят, это хорошо. Однако нет ничего плохого в том, чтобы какое-то время побыть дома.</p>
<p>Ванесса и я сейчас не можем работать в одно и то же время. Мы не хотим, чтобы кто-то другой заботился о Лили. Так что небольшие роли, которые позволяли бы мне не уезжать надолго, были для меня как раз тем, чем нужно. Может быть, какие-то слухи пошли, но внезапно у меня появилось много предложений на эпизоды, и уже просто от режиссера зависело, брался ли я за них. Я знал Юлиана Шнабеля в Нью-Йорке много лет, он очень остроумный парень, даже если все его забавные истории касаются только его самого. Он позвонил и спросил, не хотел бы я сыграть маленькую роль трансвестита в «Пока не опустится ночь». Я подумал – это легко, мне только придется носить лифчик и одежду, которую он попросит. Пока я не окунулся глубже в реального Бон Бона, который должен был выглядеть, как Софи Лорен. Я понял, что мне придется работать действительно тяжело и серьезно, и это уже касалось не только костюмов и парика.</p>
<p>- Насколько я понял, Вы не считаете, что симпатичная внешность является чем-то важным.</p>
<p>- Вы знаете, кто такой Серж Гейнзбур? Конечно, знаете. Ванесса делала с ним свой второй альбом. Хороший музыкант и поэт-песенник, у него всегда были красивые женщины – Бриджит Бардо, Катрин Денев, Джейн Биркин. На протяжении всей его жизни пресса писала о нем: хороший певец, хороший актер, но, Боже, как он уродлив! Это беспокоило его, но сейчас он сказал: хорошо, это правда, но лучше быть уродом, чем красавцем, который превращается в урода. Рано или поздно все мы состаримся, и если Вы связываете свое благополучие со своей внешностью, Вы ошибаетесь заранее. Если бы у меня был выбор, я предпочел бы, чтобы моя голова была муляжом, который я мог бы снимать в конце каждого съемочного дня.</p>
<p>Когда я снимался в этом проклятом сериале, я видел свое лицо на обложке каждого журнала, и я заметил, что это не принесло мне ничего хорошего. Это была моя собственная ошибка: я поверил чужим словам и неосмотрительно поставил свою подпись под контрактом, не понимая, что, сделав это, я перечеркну все возможности для самостоятельных действий и решений на несколько лет. Я был не актером, а товаром, типажом. Есть люди, которые могут справиться с тем, чтобы быть раскрученной звездой, я уважаю их за это. Они думают: если я буду регулярно играть в коммерческих фильмах, отрабатывая свой брэнд, я смогу играть роли, в которые я действительно верю. Или: пока я звезда, они платят мне приличные суммы. Когда я им надоем, я смогу жить так, как хочу. Но меня это не мотивирует. У меня аллергия на трафаретное кино. Если я должен произносить слова, которые много других персонажей повторяли до меня много раз, я заболеваю.</p>
<p>Телевидение - это на сто процентов конвейерное производство, вы не растете, вы ничему не учитесь. Единственная вещь, которую я там узнал, состояла в том, что я не могу так жить, и единственная проблема была в том, как долго я смогу это вынести. Я никогда не хотел быть звездой, и, начиная с 1988 года, я не смотрел на обложки журналов. Я не хочу знать, кто и что думает обо мне, какой фильм был блокбастером месяца, кто получил Оскар или кто должен был получить его. С самого первого момента, когда я начал играть, я хотел быть характерным актером. Чтобы играть роль, Вы должны любить этот характер.</p>
<p>- И, разрешите уточнить, какие характеры привлекают Вас больше всего?</p>
<p>- Поврежденные, странные люди. Меня чрезвычайно интересует, как поврежденные личности выживают в этой жизни, что скрывается за их фасадом. В сущности, этот критерий говорит не слишком много: нет людей, которые не были бы повреждены – я, например, так уж точно. Странная вещь состоит в том, что Вы осознаете это только тогда, когда Вам есть с чем сравнивать.</p>
<p>У моих родителей был неважный брак, они переезжали раз тридцать, когда я был ребенком. Я никогда не понимал, почему они всегда уезжали - думаю, они не знали себя. Я не могу вспомнить все дома, в которых мы жили. Я никогда не задерживался на одном месте настолько, чтобы привыкнуть к школе и найти себе друзей. Я не был чужаком - для этого я должен был понимать, чем я отличаюсь от остальных - но я знал, что своим я тоже не был. Когда мне было около пятнадцати, мы наконец задержались где-то настолько, что я стал возвращаться домой вместе с несколькими одноклассниками. Я тогда первый раз увидел, как жили другие семьи, как они садились обедать за общий стол, как они съедали за обедом сначала салат, потом основные блюда и только потом десерт. Наша семья садилась за общий стол только на Рождество. Я начинал есть с десерта и заканчивал салатом. Раз или два в год я мог заметить, что мои родители любили меня, и, как самый младший, я думал, что это я сохраняю покой в семье. Но когда они в конечном счете развелись, это тоже ушло. Иногда Вам просто кажется, что некоторые вещи нормальны. Например, я так привык к папарацци, которые торчали рядом даже тогда, когда я просто обедал, что понял оскорбительную нелепость этого, только когда меня оставили в покое во Франции. В течение многих лет я жил на гамбургерах, фаст-фуде, биг-маках и т.п. Теперь я обнаружил, что бывает другое качество жизни, я смею экспериментировать в ресторанах, заказывать блюда, о которых я никогда раньше не слышал или которые не интересовали меня прежде. Американцы думают, что я - сноб, но если Вы привыкли к французскому вину, Napa Valley Вам будет пить тяжеловато. И если Вы читали Рембо и Верлена, Вы захотите когда-нибудь попробовать абсент. Я, например, купил несколько бутылочек, но как-то боялся их трогать.</p>
<p>Когда я был в Праге (мы снимали там фильм «Из ада»), я подумал, что время для абсента пришло. Я был очень одинок в Чешской Республике. Теперь я думаю, что лучше уж было выпить керосин. Эта штука абсолютно не усваивается организмом, так что я остаюсь верен водке.</p>
<p>- Вы начинали как поп-музыкант.</p>
<p>- Сольные партии на гитаре я играл только у себя на чердаке. В группе Вы должны играть с другими. Я пел не хуже остальных, но я никогда не хотел быть певцом и стоять на авансцене. Мне больше нравилось играть бэкграунд в тени.</p>
<p>Строго говоря, рок-н-ролл тоже не слишком полезен для здоровья, но я уверен, что без музыки я кончил бы ужасно. Я бы спился или обкололся до смерти, заполняя эту пустоту. Возможно, я не стал бы полным наркоманом, у меня не было таланта к этому делу. Наркотики я перестал употреблять очень давно, но нет зелья, которого я в свое время не попробовал. Наркотики точно не мое, но к силе характера, к сожалению, это не имеет никакого отношения, это только мое везение.</p>
<p>Я был однажды на грани передоза, во время съемок «Что гложет Гилберта Грейпа?». Мне тогда только что исполнилось тридцать, у меня было тяжелое время, и это продолжалось в течение нескольких месяцев. Я сейчас буду говорить как какой-нибудь Джон Денвер, но я читал в книгах относительно согласия с собой и встречал людей, которые достигли такого состояния. Я думал, что тридцать – это возраст, когда надо начинать думать над чем-то подобным, а сам продолжал возиться со своими старыми кошмарами. И фильм был про разрушенную гибнущую семью, это разбудило старые болячки. На съемках я был меланхолическим, упрямым тупицей. Лассе Халльстрем - волшебный режиссер с бесконечным терпением, но я был уверен, что он будет чрезвычайно рад распрощаться и никогда больше не встречаться со мной после окончания съемок. Так что я был шокирован и тронут, когда он снова позвонил и пригласил меня в «Шоколад».</p>
<p>- Вы никогда не учились актерскому мастерству.</p>
<p>- Перед тем как начались съемки «Дон Жуана де Марко», Марлон Брандо пригласил меня к себе и сказал, что я должен поступить в Королевскую Академию драматического искусства в Лондоне. Он говорил о том, что у американских актеров плохая школа, плохой язык и плохая дикция. Бывают исключения, но если американцы играют Шекспира, то лучше просто заткнуть уши. Так же как и сочинение стихов, актерское мастерство - это профессия. Марлон был прав. Если бы его совет я получил немного раньше, я бы, конечно, ему последовал. Но в моем возрасте уже слишком поздно ходить в школу. Я - книжный червь, я люблю красивый язык, но сам я едва ли могу выражаться должным образом.</p>
<p>Понятие «серьезная игра» – это вообще оксюморон. Актерство - это ложь, притворство, имитация жизни, это лучше назвать «серьезным враньем». Только комики бывают по-настоящему серьезны, каждая шутка основана на боли и ужасе. Комедии вырастают из трагедий.</p>
<p>Все, что я знаю об актерском мастерстве, я узнал, наблюдая за другими актерами.</p>
<p>Намного раньше, чем я вообще начал думать о том, чтобы стать актером, я был буквально заворожен актерами старого немого кино, вроде хаммеровских фильмов ужасов. В тех фильмах они играли в стиле, который в известном смысле был на грани приемлемого, но который четко соответствовал стилю самого фильма. Позже я узнал, что эти актеры играют в театре Шекспира и Марлоу. Было потрясающе потом встретиться и играть с некоторыми из них в «Сонной Лощине». Моя задача как актера просто состояла в том, чтобы обеспечить моим партнерам пространство, необходимое для их игры.</p>
<p>Я видел Жюльетт Бинош в «Любовниках на мосту» и Джона Туртурро в «Большом Лебовски». Я не люблю этот фильм, но его сцену я смотрел двадцать раз – это близко к произведению искусства настолько, насколько это возможно в нашей профессии. И когда Вас приглашают играть с такими актерами, Вы думаете: господи, это шанс узнать что-то новое и, возможно, помочь им сделать снова такие же прекрасные работы.</p>
<p>- Лассе Халльстрем сказал, что Вы должны перестать прятаться за эксцентричными характерами своих персонажей. Может быть, они заменяют Вам маску, которую Вы не можете снять?</p>
<p>- Моей первой большой ролью был Эдвард – Руки-Ножницы. В последний день съемки я был в гриме и вдруг увидел лицо этого незаконченного парня в зеркале. Я внезапно понял, что никогда больше не увижусь с ним. Это очень расстроило меня. Быть столь открытым, непредвзятым и свободным от всякого цинизма –это дало мне странное чувство безопасности и свободы. Я хотел бы остаться таким невинным.</p>
<p>Иногда я чувствую сильную ностальгию по ролям, которые я сыграл. Например, по Раулю из «Страха и ненависти в Лас-Вегасе». Я могу любить только те характеры, которые на меня не похожи, а себя я не люблю. Возможность не быть собой в течение пары месяцев дает мне хорошее и защищенное чувство.</p>
<p>Возможно, Лассе прав, возможно, я ленив или даже труслив. Я легко могу играть роли, подобные Эду Вуду: каждый день дурачиться и веселиться с Мартином Ландау на съемочной площадке. Но если бы кто-то предложил мне роль с большой несчастной любовью, я не знал бы, стоит ли за это браться. Я однажды играл обычного человека в фильме «В последний момент». Это было тяжело. Когда Вы играете обычного человека, Вы должны непрерывно придумывать всякие мелкие детали, если не хотите наскучить зрителям. Кроме того, я вообще никогда не считаю абсолютно нормальными поступки других людей, и роли, которые я выбираю, мне слишком странными никогда не кажутся.</p>
<p>Когда я смотрю на всяких мачо из героических картин, я вижу у них черты, которые в обычной жизни присущи только крайне агрессивным личностям. У меня нет проблем с тем, чтобы сыграть агрессивную личность, однако не тем способом, который обычно принят в нашем кинематографе.</p>
<p>Когда я читаю сценарий, я сосредотачиваюсь только на диалогах. Я не обращаю внимания на режиссерские ремарки. Я не хочу разрешать другим указывать мне в письменном виде, что я должен сидеть в кресле, если я не видел этого кресла или не знаю, где оно. Я - действительно как кость в горле, иначе я не стал бы актером. Никто не может приказывать мне, как я должен играть, потому что никто не чувствует то, что я чувствую.</p>
<p>У меня редко возникают проблемы с режиссерами, проблемы бывают у меня с продюсерами и кинокомпаниями. На место съемок приходит факс: мы все видели, это кошмар, прикажите Деппу прекратить валять дурака или мы уволим его. Если я встану на их место, я, конечно, могу понять, что я едва ли являюсь гарантом кассового успеха. Моя карьера по существу смонтирована на провалах. Когда «Сонная Лощина» стала успешной в прокате, я был искренне смущен и думал: что пошло не так, как надо?</p>
<p>- Фильмы с европейскими режиссерами, Сезар за Ваши киноработы во Франции, но никаких номинаций на Оскара. Это было предопределено, что Вы осядете в Европе?</p>
<p>- Когда я покончил со своим телевизионным контрактом, я сразу сел в самолет и полетел в Париж – город, которым после чтения своих любимых авторов я восхищался. Это было похоже на освобождение, я снова мог дышать, но это не было чувство возвращения домой. Из-за того, как я рос, у меня вообще не было никакой концепции «дома». Собственно, я не должен особенно сожалеть об этом, есть люди, которым досталось гораздо больше, чем мне. Ко всему можно привыкнуть, в том числе и к 35 годам пустоты. Мне никогда не приходило в голову остаться жить во Франции, пока я не встретил Ванессу.</p>
<p>Я влюблялся и прежде – и при этом гораздо реже, чем предполагают бульварные газеты - но я впервые нашел кого-то, кто хотел подарить мне ребенка. К счастью, Ванесса – девочка из хорошей семьи, иначе я не посмел бы этого делать. Сам я не большой специалист по воспитанию детей, у меня скорее отрицательный опыт.</p>
<p>Специально мы ничего не планировали, и я вообще не думаю, что мы можем влиять на то, что с нами должно случиться. Говорят, что только впоследствии люди понимают, как они были счастливы, но в течение беременности Ванессы я совершенно сознательно был очень счастлив. Я могу вспомнить практически каждую минуту. Рождение Лили было связано с одним паническим моментом – я думал, что у нас будет сын, и я смотрел на нее и думал: господи, чего-то явно не хватает!</p>
<p>Впоследствии я сделал важное открытие: это был самый чистый, самый светлый момент моей жизни, и это произошло в конце столетия. Все мое прошлое стало незначительным, все, что со мной случилось, привело меня к Лили. Она более чем заслуживает этого.</p>
<p>Жизнь, которую мы теперь ведем, похожа на нормальную жизнь настолько, насколько это вообще возможно при нашей профессии. Я вовсе не ненавижу Америку, я берегу свою нежную любовь к тому, чем была и чем могла бы быть эта страна, к простым людям на Среднем Западе, которые просто работают и пробуют выжить. Но я ненавижу амбиции, близорукость, лицемерие, бесполезную боль и насилие в семьях. Я чувствую, что мое отвращение к Америке вызвано именно этим. Я чуть не сошел с ума, пока жил там, и, конечно, я не стану подвергать такому риску мою девочку.</p>
<p>У нас теперь есть ферма на Сене около деревни, в которой единственный кинотеатр был закрыт много лет назад. Люди там не знают, кто я такой, да даже если и узнают, им будет не слишком интересно; они не будут дергать меня на тему, какой фильм стал лидером проката в последний уикенд. Мы говорим о погоде, о будущем урожае, пьем пиво в баре. Возможно, когда-нибудь это превратится в рутину, но я надеюсь, что нет. Сейчас я живу на облаках, хотя и знаю, что превратился в ходячее клише.</p>

Джерри относился к нему как отец или старший брат. Это был такой же скромный человек, как и Джонни. А Джонни называл его «моя мама» и очень любил и любит его. 22 года они были неразлучны. Джерри ушел из жизни около года назад. 5 апреля был день памяти. Но Джонни говорит, что постоянно чувствует его рядом с собой. Он посвящает ему песни на концертах и скучает по нему, как никто другой.</p>","{'id': '223670680', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/7/gf/hv/PaGFhvbYPznkBiM-800x450-noPad.jpg?1588194418', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

<p>""У Джонни всегда было чистое отношение к любви. Однако у него было много женщин, но не так много, как об этом пишет бульварная пресса. Его редкая красота никого не могла оставить равнодушным. Безумно влюбленная в него старшеклассница затащила его, 13-летнего мальчика, в вагончик к отцу…</p>
<p>Потом были другие женщины. Большую роль здесь сыграли также его поклонницы, которых он боялся, не каждую в отдельности, а толпу, это постоянно мучило его, было большой его проблемой. Они писали письма тысячами.</p>
<p>У него было несколько серьезных романов, но все они заканчивались неудачно. Разрыв отношений был для Джонни всегда очень болезненным, потому что он - неординарный человек, художник, способный на очень глубокие чувства. Он считает, что любить по-настоящему можно несколько раз.</p>
<p>Джонни очень любит детей и очень хотел иметь ребенка. Он стал жить с Ванессой Паради - она пообещала ему подарить ребенка. Это была бесконечно обожаемая Джонни Лили-Роуз. Потом был Джек...</p>
<p>А потом случилось несчастье. Во время съемок фильма «Ромовый дневник» Джонни встретился с актрисой Эмбер Херд и полюбил ее. Но она повела себя странно, начались издательства над Джонни, который годы терпел все это. Дело дошло до развода.</p>
<p>Адвокат Джонни Адам Вальдман дал Эмбер очень верную характеристику как злостному абьюзеру. То есть, человеку, совершающему насилие по отношению к Джонни, которое у нее проявлялось в физической, эмоциональной и психологической сферах. Последнее является одним из самых страшных видов насилия. Джонни любил ее, а у нее была другая цель – обобрать мультимиллионера, честным и упорным трудом, заработавшего эти деньги.</p>
<p>Джонни, как всегда, страдал молча. Еще в тяжелом детстве он пришел к выводу, что все отношения с людьми надо улаживать конструктивно, особенно с женщинами - у него были сложные отношения с мамой. И он следовал этому, пытаясь все уладить. Но это был не тот случай.</p>
<p>Он доверял свои чувства бумаге. «Утром я заливал в себя водку и начинал писать, пока мои глаза не наполнялись слезами так, что я больше не мог видеть лист бумаги. Я все время пытался понять, что я сделал такого, чтобы заслужить все это. Я старался быть добрым ко всем, помогать всем, быть честным для всех… Для меня это самое важное. Но, несмотря на все это, я попал в такую историю». «Я хочу знать правду. Это действительно моя самая большая одержимость в мире. Это просто fucking правда».</p>
<p>А теперь фанаты Эмбер желают Джонни гибели и продолжают зверски издеваться над этим беззащитным, очень застенчивым человеком, который из совершенно другого мира, в котором не водятся такие, как Эмбер. Однако адвокат Адам Вальдман сказал: «Справедливость, спустя три года, почти восторжествовала. Людей не так просто обмануть, и правду не скрыть».</p>
<p>Простите, дорогой Джонни, что я все это пишу, но моя единственная цель - по мере своих сил как-то содействовать тому, чтобы люди увидели ваше истинное лицо, чтобы они полностью были на вашей стороне, чтобы пресса была на вашей стороне, а не на стороне Эмбер Херд, которая активно борется против вас"".</p>
<p>L.P.</p>
<p>Следует добавить, что после разрыва с Эмбер Херд Джонни было очень тяжело, каждый день он испытывал невыносимую боль, как он говорит. К тому же ушла из жизни его мама, что он крайне болезненно переживал. А Эмбер через несколько дней после этого подала на Джонни клеветнический иск в суд о домашнем насилии, о том, что Джонни избивал ее. А также опубликовала это в прессе. Джонни думал о самоубийстве...</p>
<p>Эта статья была написана 16.10.2019. К сожалению, ситуация сейчас усугубляется. Недавно Джонни представил в суд в Лондоне очень сильные доказательства того, что он не избивал Эмбер Херд. В отместку за это Херд подала на него клеветническое заявление в суд, теперь уже о сексуальном насилии со стороны Джонни Деппа. Суд намечен на июль 2020, в Штатах. Что там скажет Джонни, даже страшно подумать, и вообще в состоянии ли он будет что-то говорить...</p>
<p>Отец Эмбер Херд не отменял своих угроз пристрелить Джонни. Более того, оказывается, у Эмбер Херд тоже есть оружие, как пишут в СМИ. Отец, видимо, подарил ей его, она ведь тоже из Техаса, где все ходят с оружием, как он говорит. А значит, актуальность этой петиции возрастает.</p>
<p>Мы очень благодарны всем вам за подписи и продвижение петиции! И Джонни будет бесконечно благодарен вам, когда посмотрит эту петицию, если еще не смотрел. Она в открытом доступе и здесь, и в США.</p>
<p>Я распространяю эту петицию, в том числе, в Твиттере, а американские друзья помогают мне. Это хороший способ представить петицию широкому кругу заинтересованных людей. Вы также можете этим воспользоваться. В общем, у нас есть хорошее занятие на период самоизоляции - подписывать и распространять петицию по всему миру. Так не будем терять время!</p>

<p>Гладят по лицу, пока он пишет автограф... Любят... Охранники, не церемонясь, силой оттаскивают его от толпы поклонников... Ведь ему тоже нужен отдых.</p>
<p>А он не может оторваться от протянутых рук, умоляющих глаз... Может быть, эти люди годы ожидали встречу с ним... Джонни является актером, который больше всех раздает автографы... </p>
<p>Он старается поговорить с ними, утешить тех, кто печален, помочь, как только может. Его приоритеты - инвалиды, дети, люди пожилого возраста, которые особенно нуждаются в поддержке. </p>
<p>В его словах столько доброты и любви, возможно, это единственное выражение любви, услышанное ими за последние годы...</p>
<p>Не все понимают его английскую речь, но переводчик им и не нужен - они понимают его сердцем.</p>
<p>Они любят его не только за гениальную актерскую игру, но и за редкую красоту, не только внешнюю, но, в основном, за внутреннюю красоту...</p>
<p>Любят его как необыкновенного человека, который помогает жить, выжить, и добиться поставленной цели.</p>
<p>Дети часто отождествляют Джонни с его сказочными героями, сошедшими с экрана. Джонни много снимался в детских фильмах. Радости их нет предела, они бросаются на шею ожившему доброму волшебнику. Джонни говорит, что когда он дарит счастье детям, он счастлив сам. Думаю, это можно отнести ко всем его поклонникам, с которыми он общается.</p>
<p>Откуда у уличного мальчишки, которым Джонни был в юности, переносившим побои и унижения как со стороны своих родителей, так и окружающих ребят, называвших его ""тронутый"", переиначив его фамилию, столько доброты и любви? </p>
<p>Очень застенчивый и замкнутый, никем не понятый, отвергаемый всеми, он варился в своем собственном соку. И в конечном итоге из полунищего подростка получился Джонни Депп, вошедший в Книгу рекордов Гиннеса как самый высокооплачиваемый актер, который бросился раздавать деньги тем, кому они были необходимы... Джонни Депп считается лучшим актером современности.</p>
<p>Кто-то из великих сказал: ""Застенчивые правят миром"". Так оно и есть. У Джонни десятки миллионов поклонников в разных странах, которых он называет своей семьей, другой семьи у него нет. Он имеет колоссальное влияние на людей, он делает их лучше, чище, добрее, указывает истинные ценности в этом мире. Один перед толпой...</p>
<p>В одном из своих фильмов Джонни Депп говорит: ""В жизни есть четыре важных вопроса... Что есть святое? Из чего сделан дух? Ради чего стоит жить и за что стоит умереть? Ответ на каждый из них один и тот же. Только любовь"".</p>
<p>А что есть Джонни Депп, кто он? Представляется, что и здесь ответ тот же...</p>

<p>Струится боль из-под ресниц, <br>Но дарит истинный покой. <br>Твой взгляд – покорный и святой – <br>Пред ним нельзя не падать ниц... </p>
<p>Из стихотворения М. Кардозо Infinitum </p>
<p>Джонни Депп, действительно, боится своих поклонников, толпы, ему лучше в стороне, в тени, и ""темная комната"" на худой конец сгодится). Он этого не скрывает. И не нужны ему ни Оскары, ни известность, ни слава... Почему так?</p>
<p>Однако, не смотря на все это, он обожает своих поклонников и проявляет к ним максимум внимания, конечно, в меру своих сил и не выходя за рамки своего характера. Общение дается ему сложнее, чем обычным людям, он смущается, волнуется, пытаясь преодолеть внутренний барьер и установить контакт, тратит на это свои силы и энергию. И опять-таки в силу своего характера, он очень хорошо может понять человека, глубоко поникнуть к нему в душу и оставить в ней неизгладимый след...</p>
<p>Далеко не все поклонники Джонни Деппа понимают его. Он - сложная личность, некоторые из них обижаются на него за недостаточное проявление внимания по отношению к ним. А это зависит, в том числе, и от особенностей его характера. Представляется, что Джонни Депп относится к категории людей, которые характеризуются как застенчивые интроверты. Поэты и философы различных эпох, такие как Артур Шопенгауэр и Джон Мильтон, связывали между собой застенчивость и интроверсию.</p>
<p>Немного из науки… <br>Интроверсия по Юнгу – это личностная ориентация на себя. «Интровертированная личность отличается высокой чувствительностью и впечатлительностью. Такие люди подвержены глубокому самоанализу и самокритике. Они обычно серьезные, размеренные, им чужда спонтанность действий, очень редко проявляют инициативу к общению. Они лучше предадутся личным размышлениям, нежели будут идти с кем-то на контакт. Но это не подразумевает, что они никогда совсем ни с кем не разговаривают. У них есть друзья, которые принимают их такими, какими они есть». <a href=""https://psihomed.com/introversiya/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://psihomed.com/introversiya/</a></p>
<p>Что касается застенчивости – то это страх негативной оценки. Возможно, существует генетическая предрасположенность к застенчивости, которая может расцвести пышным цветом, если ребенок предоставлен сам себе, как это было с Деппом... Это мощное чувство, которое возникает у человека при общении с другими людьми, своеобразный страх перед общением.</p>
<p>Застенчивый человек боится враждебного отношения, боится устанавливать контакт, боится потерять самоуважение и уважение окружающих. При этом возникает психический дискомфорт, который, вероятно, является наиболее частым вариантом подобных расстройств.</p>
<p>Любая стрессовая ситуация для застенчивого человека оказывается чрезвычайно сложной и болезненной, значительно снижается устойчивость к стрессам, что даже может привести к возникновению ряда соматических патологий, не дай Бог! Джонни боролся со стрессами, нанося себе раны, это хоть как-то помогало... Шрамы от них скрыты под тату.</p>
<p>Но это никак не свидетельствует о том, что он слабый человек, наоборот он сильный и мужественный. Но что заложено в генах, в подкорке - все это очень сложно... Попытки скрыть свою стеснительность не помогают. Как это не странно, единственным эффективным лекарством для него оказалось кино - он полностью избавляется от своей застенчивости, когда входит в образ своего персонажа...</p>
<p>«Психологи признают связь между застенчивостью и интроверсией, в том смысле, что многие застенчивые люди являются интровертами и наоборот … Данная связь обусловлена рядом факторов. Во-первых, некоторые люди с рождения склонны принимать все близко к сердцу, и это качество предрасполагает их как к застенчивости, так и к интроверсии.</p>
<p>К тому же, застенчивый человек со временем может стать более интроверсированным – если социальная жизнь причиняет ему боль, он будет мотивирован искать удовольствие в одиночестве, в условиях минимального социального окружения». <a href=""https://vadimkurkin.com/blog/biblioteka-psikhologii/y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vadimkurkin.com/blog/biblioteka-psikhologii/y</a></p>
<p>Поэтому Джонни Деппа надо принимать таким, какой он есть. И мы принимаем его таким...</p>
<p>Беглец от толпы, любитель одиночества, как называет себя Джонни, как бы по иронии судьбы поставленный перед толпой, не только застенчивый, но и очень скромный человек. </p>
<p>Джонни старается быть на одном уровне с поклонниками своего творчества, которых называет своей семьей, не выделяться среди них. Он не любит, когда к нему обращаются «Мистер Депп» или «Джон». Только - Джонни. Это сразу сокращает расстояние между ним и людьми. Уменьшительным именем обычно называют друзей.</p>
<p>""Я маленький стеснительный человек» - говорит о себе Джонни. Суперзвезда Голливуда говорит - я не звезда, он не любит про звезды)) Джонни обладает блестящим умом, и знает, как понравиться человеку, он никогда не ставит себя выше остальных, не дай Бог! Ему абсолютно чужда ""звездная болезнь"".</p>
<p>Он поражает своей искренностью и добротой. И дарит столько любви и тепла человеку, что это навсегда остается в его душе, дает ему возможность дать себе более высокую оценку, и может поддержать в трудную минуту. А люди отвечают Джонни взаимной любовью, что ему так необходимо.</p>

<p>Представляется, что речь Джонни Деппа в Инстаграме - это одно из самых честных высказываний об изоляции, в котором также чувствуется искреннее стремление помочь людям, ведь без этого Джонни не может. Кроме того, он очень проницательный человек, в некоторой степени он может предвидеть будущее, подтверждением чему может быть, в частности, песня Изоляция.</p>
<p><strong>Джонни Депп:</strong></p>
<p>""Привет всем, кто смотрит эту запись! Это мой первый опыт общения через соцсети, я такого еще не делал. Не мог найти повода для этого. Сейчас самое время начать диалог.</p>
<p>Невидимый враг стал причиной большого числа трагедий, разрушил многие жизни.<strong> Люди болеют, борются за каждый вдох, люди умирают, статистика шокирует,</strong> многие потеряли связь с семьей из-за этой жуткой мировой пандемии. Некоторые потеряли работу, доход, потеряли свой бизнес, который создавали долгие годы.</p>
<p>Также огромное количество людей, которые живут на улице, не могут спастись, им некуда идти, негде спрятаться. <strong>Нам нужно помочь тем, кого мы любим, а также другим людям, ради нашего общего будущего.</strong></p>
<p>Я знаю, может показаться, что мы связаны по обеим рукам, в каком-то смысле — так и есть. Но наши сердца и головы ничем не ограничены. Мы способны заботиться, и только забота поможет нам все это преодолеть. Все, что нужно, быть более внимательными к тому, что происходит вокруг. Я просто прошу вас обратить на это внимание.</p>
<p>А теперь сообщение для тех, кто дослушал до этого момента. Ну что, во-первых, и, наверное, <strong>самое главное, будьте здоровы, аккуратны и не выходите из дома.</strong> Проведите это время с пользой для своих близких, с теми, кого вы любите, несмотря на обстоятельства, не дайте карантину вас сломать.</p>
<p><strong>Интересуйтесь новым, используйте это время для познания чего-то нового, у вас есть сегодняшний день, он не восполнится.</strong> Создайте что-то такое, что будет полезно для будущего, сделайте день другого человека чуть лучше.</p>
<p>Помню, как сейчас, когда мои дети были маленькие, они подходили ко мне и говорили: «Пап, мне скучно!» Моя реакция всегда была одна и та же: «Не разрешайте себе скучать. Всегда есть, чем заняться». Порисуйте, почитайте, снимите видео на телефон, поиграйте на музыкальных инструментах.</p>
<p>Нет инструмента? Сделайте сами. Извлекайте звуки из предметов вокруг, напишите песню, суть музыки в воспроизведении звуков. Конечно, пока соседей нет.

<p>Прежде чем я закончу и вы вернетесь к своей жизни, я бы хотел поделиться нашей общей работой с Джеффом Беком, в последние пару лет я имел огромную честь работать с Джеффом Беком, моим кумиром.<strong> Год или полтора назад мы с ним записали песню Isolation Джона Леннона, это настоящая поэзия, такая глубина смыслов, для меня и Джеффа она стала настоящим отражением сегодняшней ситуации. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma-149FnSN4&amp;feature=emb_logo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma-149FnSN4&amp;feature=emb_logo</a></strong></p>
<p>Это песня об изоляции, страхе, <strong>об экзистенциальном риске для нашего мира.</strong> Мы хотим подарить вам песню, и надеемся, что она поможет вам почувствовать себя лучше в это непростое время, когда мы с вами все в изоляции.</p>
<p>Надеюсь, скоро для нас настанет момент, когда мы будем в безопасности. Спасибо, что выслушали меня, и <strong>спасибо за вашу доброту и поддержку все эти годы, я очень тронут, просто слов нет.</strong> Надеюсь, вам понравится наша версия Isolation. Большое спасибо, нас ждет многое впереди, еще увидимся. Будьте здоровы, пока"".</p>
<p>Перевод группы ""Российский сайт Джонни Деппа"". </p>
<p><strong>И еще высказывание Джонни об Изоляции:</strong> ""Джефф Бек и я записали песню Isolation в прошлом году, взяв за основу прекрасную мелодию Джона Леннона, его поэзию. ""Мы боимся всех! Боимся солнца!"" - очевидно, сейчас это особенно актуально для нас с Джефом, песня об изоляции, страхе и экзистенциальных рисках нашего мира. Мы хотим поделиться этой песней с вами, и надеемся, что она поможет вам пережить этот непростой период или просто скоротать время, пока мы все вынуждены терпеть изоляцию"". © Джонни Депп.</p>
<p><strong>Напоминание или пояснение.</strong><strong> </strong>Экзистенциальный риск – это событие, которое потенциально может уничтожить человечество, или, по меньшей мере, истребить значительную его часть, лишив тех, кто выжил, возможности восстановить современный уровень жизни и развития общества.</p>
<p>В своей речи Джонни сказал: ""Люди болеют, борются за каждый вдох, люди умирают, статистика шокирует... Нам нужно помочь тем, кого мы любим, а также другим людям, ради нашего общего будущего"". <strong>Помочь можно и своей подписью под петицией: ""Мы не хотим болеть и умирать от гриппа и коронавируса!!!""

Его внешность принесла ему много страданий. Он нравился и нравится всем, а это мешает его работе.</p>
<p>К тому же Джонни скромный и застенчивый человек, и ему не по себе, когда на него смотрят, он чувствует себя  незащищенным. Поэтому он старается всячески скрыть свою красоту. Черные очки, бандана, надвинутая на очки, шапка, закрывающая пол лица, опущенная голова…</p>
<p>И если еще добавить крайне изношенную одежду - это Джонни. Его даже однажды приняли за бомжа… А он ведь мультимиллионер, по крайней мере, до суда им был.</p>
<p>Из интервью – Бриджит Стейнметц : ""...Актер старается выглядеть настолько плохо, насколько это возможно, как он всегда делает: жирные волосы, мятая серая рубашка, застиранные черные «Левайс». Но сколько бы он ни пытался, не срабатывает.</p>
<p>Он выглядит так, что перехватывает дыхание, - его высокое телосложение и эти скулы, ради которых другие повыбивали бы себе все задние зубы. «Он – художник, попавший в ловушку тела мальчика с плаката», - говорит Роман Полански.</p>
<p>Депп покрыт мечтательной аурой слегка чокнутого – он говорит нежным голосом, словно в трансе, он обрывает речь посредине тщательно выстроенных предложений, чтобы неожиданно повторить вопрос и начать снова.</p>
<p>И это не уловка, это то, что Тим Бертон увидел в глазах этого подросткового кумира из «Джамп Стрит 21»: печаль, ту глубину, как если бы он прожил намного дольше, с тех пор, как люди еще боялись темноты и ветряных мельниц, этого зловещего звука ветра по ночам"".</p>
<p>Джонни мудрый, интеллектуальный, это глубокая натура, серьезный художник, скрупулезно относящийся к своей работе, трудяга. К тому же он очень замкнутый человек, отталкивает любого, кто старается хоть как-то заглянуть в его душу. Он загадочная и странная личность. Все странные - говорит он.</p>
<p>Но с людьми, которых  Джонни хорошо знает, он не особенно стесняется, он раскован, общителен, любит пошутить. Но если он чувствует, что кто-то может ему навредить, он не может избавиться от своей застенчивости.</p>
<p>Джонни таких людей не боится, он на редкость смелый человек. Он боится своей реакции  на такого человека, силе своих чувств, которые могут ему повредить...</p>","{'id': '223594728', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/xa/ul/GnXaULZxiIWEVdH-800x450-noPad.jpg?1587251214', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

<p>Здесь дается перевод петиции  на русский язык. Видимо, это раньше надо было сделать. Но, как говорится, лучше поздно... Кто не знает английского - приносим свои извинения. Эта петиция адресована  американцам, включая Джонни Деппа, который кроме ""спасибо"" других русских слов не знает)</p>
<p>Короче, перевод.</p>
<p>СПАСИТЕ ЖИЗНЬ ДЖОННИ ДЕППА и его КАРЬЕРУ!!!</p>
<p>Lana P. создал(а) эту петицию, адресованную губернаторам штатов Калифорния, Техас, Вирджиния и Джонни Деппу, США.</p>
<p>Жизни известнейшего актера нашего времени Джонни Деппа угрожает опасность - отец актрисы Эмбер Херд из Техаса угрожал убить его. Об этом сообщило издание The Blast. Отца актрисы Дэвида Херда поддерживают сторонники Эмбер Херд, желающие Деппу смерти. Команда Херд уверена, что это является нормальной реакцией любого отца в ответ на  насилие в отношении его собственного ребенка.</p>
<p>Бизнесмен Дэвид Киллаки, ранее сотрудничавший с Джонни Деппом, подтвердил, что Джонни поступали вполне реальные угрозы. Отец Эмбер часто вел себя агрессивно и для расправы с актером даже хотел приехать в Лос-Анджелес, где живет Джонни. Отец Эмбер грозился пристрелить Джонни Деппа и угрожал самому Киллаки. </p>
<p>«Я из Техаса, а мужчины там всегда держат при себе 45 калибр, я прикончу Джонни!"" - сказал отец Эмбер в телефонном разговоре с Киллаки и попросил это передать Джонни. Киллаки воспитывался в семье помощника шерифа, занимающегося расследованием убийств, и очень серьезно относится  к таким угрозам.</p>
<p>Джонни Депп молча переносил все обвинения в физическом и психологическом насилии, годы терпел, он до последнего надеялся, что удастся урегулировать эту ситуацию, ведь он никакого вреда Эмбер Херд не причинял и продолжал любить ее. Но многие приняли его молчание за признание своей вины.</p>
<p>Джонни Депп и Эмбер Херд поженились в феврале 2015 года, а в мае 2016 года Херд подала на развод, объяснив свое решение непреодолимыми противоречиями между ними. Позже она заявила суду о том, что Депп ее избивал. Однако никаких доказательств его виновности Херд до сих пор представить не смогла.</p>
<p>Эмбер Херд также опубликовала статью на тему насилия в семье в газете The Washington Post, вышедшей в Вирджинии в декабре 2018 года. В ней она не упоминает бывшего мужа, но всем и так понятно, кого она имеет в виду. Вскоре после ее публикации Деппа его исключили из «Пиратов Карибского моря», где он снимался. А Херд, наоборот, получила статус защитницы прав человека, при этом она увеличила свою популярность.</p>
<p>На протяжении последних лет Херд систематически разрушала карьеру Джонни Деппа. По словам актера, его репутация была испорчена: «Я заметил, что люди стали по-другому на меня смотреть. В их глазах я превратился в монстра. В Квазимодо». У детей Джонни спрашивали, правда ли его отец бьет женщин, как написано в журнале?</p>
<p>Дальше терпеть было невозможно, и Депп решил начать борьбу за свое честное имя. Он подал иск в суд на Эмбер за обман, в котором написал: «Она не жертва домашнего насилия, а преступница», совершившая ужасающее преступление по отношению к нему,  и потребовал компенсацию морального вреда за клевету. Джонни Депп в переписке с родителями Эмбер Херд указал, что мир узнает правду, ложь вскроется, и что это обязательно случится.</p>
<p>Депп называет показания Херд «тщательно сфабрикованной фальшивкой» и уверяет, что обвинения в его адрес являются абсолютно лживыми. Все из-за денег - говорит Джонни. Адам Вальдман, его адвокат, прокомментировал: «Мотив, стоящий за ее (Херд) обманом – деньги… Деньги – причина, по которой отец Эмбер Херд угрожал убить мистера Деппа"". Родом из несчастного голодного детства, Джонни Депп заработал деньги честным путем. Он вложил частицу своей души в каждого своего героя, и его недаром считают лучшим актером современности. </p>
<p>Отец Эмбер Херд в разговоре с Киллаки выражал недовольство не тем, что его дочь Эмбер якобы подверглась насилию. Его волновал вопрос материальной несправедливости - по словам Дэвида Херда, Депп нарушил его планы по созданию собственного кинопроекта, а о насилии в отношении его дочери в разговоре с Киллаки даже не упоминалось. Кроме того, даже собственные родители Эмбер Херд признали в переписке с Деппом, что истинным мотивом ее аферы против него является вымогательство, а не насилие.</p>
<p>Депп настаивает, что Эмбер своими заявлениями о домашнем насилии нанесла ему непоправимую душевную травму. Именно она систематически издевалась над ним, подвергала немыслимым страданиям, наносила физические травмы, он не раз оказывался между жизнью и смертью. Джонни подтвердил это множеством доказательств.</p>
<p>Эмбер Херд – это злостный, циничный абьюзер, для которого жизнь и здоровье человека ничего не значат. Одно то, что она подала свой клеветнический иск через несколько дней после смерти матери Джонни Деппа, с которой он был очень близок и крайне тяжело и болезненно перенес ее смерть, лишний раз подтверждает это. По словам Джонни, он даже думал о самоубийстве.</p>
<p>Добрый и беззащитный Джонни оказался жертвой Эмбер Херд. На защиту Джонни Деппа встали многие деятели искусства, в том числе Ванесса Паради, мать его двоих детей, с которой он расстался ради Эмбер Херд. Поклонники творчества Деппа набросились на Херд с обвинениями в клевете.</p>
<p>Доброта Джонни Деппа зашкаливает. Он никогда не пройдет равнодушно мимо инвалида, пожилого человека, мимо больного. Наоборот, известно, что он посещает клиники, делает им крупные пожертвования, и несет тяжелым больным, надежду и радость. Такие люди по природе своей не способны причинить страдания кому бы то ни было.</p>
<p>Деппа обожают дети за его незабываемые сказочные фильмы. Детей нельзя обмануть, они не бросятся на шею злому человеку. Деппа обожают взрослые не только как блестящего актера, но и как незаурядного человека, который помогает жить, выживать и достигать поставленной цели.</p>
<p>У Джонни Деппа миллионы поклонников по всему миру. В настоящее время он очень нуждается в нашей помощи. Так давайте же поможем Джонни в опасный и тяжелый период его жизни! Пусть он знает, что мы будем бороться за него до победы. Необходимо собрать как можно больше подписей под этой петицией, и чем скорее, тем лучше. ДАВАЙТЕ ПОМОЖЕМ СПАСТИ ЖИЗНЬ НАШЕГО ЛЮБИМОГО АКТЕРА ДЖОННИ ДЕППА!!! И ПОМОЖЕМ СПАСТИ ЕГО КАРЬЕРУ!!!</p>

<p>…Застенчивый,<br>Магически прекрасный,<br>Неумолимо дерзкий, озорной…<br>Отчаянный, покорный и опасный,<br>Безумно нежный, грешный и...<br>Святой…<br>Марина Кардозо</p>
<p>У Джонни Деппа были тяжелое детство и юность, о чем он сам рассказывает. Он вынужден был воровать еду, сандвичи. Даже однажды был арестован... Ему приходилось браться за любую работу. Джонни предлагал по телефону купить ручки и всякие ненужные вещи. Ему помог счастливый случай - встреча с актером Николасом Кейджем, с которым он подружился. Кейдж сказал ему - тебе терять нечего, иди в актеры. Кейдж организовал Джонни собеседование со своим агентом.</p>
<p>Джонни никогда не помышлял об актерской карьере. Он хотел стать музыкантом, гитара была его отрадой. В это время шел набор мальчиков для участия в фильме «Кошмар на улице Вязов». Режиссер подбирал красивых ребят. Тяжелые условия жизни помогли Джонни преодолеть свою невероятную застенчивость, смертельно голодный, он пришел в Голливуд... Но режиссер посчитал его некрасивым из-за того, что он был очень худенький и бледный, и не захотел его брать.</p>
<p>Однако 13-летняя дочь режиссера сказала ему, что Джонни – необыкновенный, он словно явился из другого мира. Это сыграло определенную роль, потому что фильм делался для подростков, и мнение своей дочери-подростка режиссер учел. Джонни был принят на одну из двух главных ролей в этом фильме. «Это было потрясающе, – говорит Джонни. – Уэс Крэйвен (режиссер) и помреж Аннетта Бенсон дали роль абсолютному новичку! Я был потрясен! Я представления не имел об актерской игре. Я ничего не знал об освещении, метках, камере, кадрах. Я был полным профаном».</p>
<p>Однако, после выхода сериала «Кошмар на улице Вязов» о Джонни  узнал весь мир. Необычайная игра, прекрасная внешность, редкое обаяние Джонни понравились зрителям. Сериал имел огромный успех.</p>
<p>А дальше пошли новые фильмы. Как сам Джонни говорит - это чудо: входя в образ своего героя, он полностью раскрепощается и забывает о своей застенчивости. Это уже не он, а совсем другой человек. При начале съемок «Пиратов Карибского моря» режиссер и помощники бегали по потолку и кричали, что Джонни убьет фильм. А Джонни - художник, импровизатор, он говорит те реплики, которые хочет сказать, есть это по сценарию или нет. В конце концов, на него, видимо, махнули рукой, снимали, как он хочет. Серия фильмов «Пираты Карибского моря имела колоссальный успех и миллиардные доходы.</p>
<p>Джонни стал знаменит на весь мир. Многие восторгались его необыкновенным актерским даром, чудом перевоплощения. Многие любовались его сказочной красотой. Сам Джонни никогда не считал себя красивым. Физическая красота - ничто по сравнению с красотой духовной. Именно духовная красота пронизывает все существо Джонни Деппа, отражается в его внешности, светится в его прекрасных глазах. Это - выстраданная красота, приобретенная в ходе борьбы с бесконечными трудностями, которые он встречал на своем пути. «Если я улыбаюсь - это не значит, что у меня всё хорошо, это значит, что я просто не хочу, чтоб вы знали, что творится у меня внутри» -  говорит Джонни.</p>
<p>Почему Джонни так не похож других людей, ведь трудности преодолевали многие? На этот вопрос я не знаю ответа, он где-то за пределами нашего опыта.</p>
<p>Все прекрасное в нашем мире подвергается гонению. Обывателям не нравится, то, что кто-то не такой, как они, кто-то выше и лучше их. Чтобы жить спокойно, от таких людей лучше избавиться.</p>
<p>Беспощадная травля Джонни Деппа, которая поставила его на грань выживания -  вот плата за те радости, которые он дарит своим искусством. Однако, мир не без добрых людей. В поддержку Джонни выступила общественность во многих странах. Враг очень силен, поэтому надо наращивать свои силы, чтобы отстоять человека не из этого мира, как думает о себе Джонни Депп. Потому что этот мир слишком прекрасен для него, несмотря на трудности. Надо отстоять это чудо…""</p>
<p>По одноименной статье в моем блоге Живого журнала.</p>
<p>Дорогие  друзья, давайте соберем как можно больше подписей под этой петицией! Джонни знает о деятельности поклонников своего творчества, которых он называет родственниками или друзьями. Он говорит - они мои обожаемые солдаты, которые поддерживают мою жизнь...

56,StarterPetitionUpdate,26333295,2020-04-12T20:18:10.000Z,,Why I defend Johnny Depp. Почему я защищаю Джонни Деппа,"<p>Джонни Депп. Я не начинал как его поклонник, его работа никогда не спасала мне жизнь, его щедрость никогда не помогала мне. Четырнадцать месяцев назад я мог посмотреть его фильм по телевизору и не сказать, что это был он.</p>
<p>Позвольте мне начать с того, почему я не защищаю его. <br>Я защищаю его не потому, что он симпатичный. <br>Я не защищаю его, потому что он играл Джека Воробья. <br>Я не защищаю его из-за его сексуальной привлекательности. <br>Я защищаю его не потому, что он богат, или белый, или мужчина.<br>Я защищаю его, потому что те, кто нападает на него, лгут либо откровенно, либо по недомыслию.</p>
<p>Причина, по которой я защищаю Джонни Деппа - это СМИ. Это может показаться странным, но это правда. И если вам приходится лгать или скрывать часть фактов, чтобы поддержать свое мнение, что-то не так с вашим мнением. <br>Причина, по которой я защищаю Джонни Деппа, заключается в том, что я вижу его дело отдельно от чумы, которая является домашним насилием.<br>…………<br>Является ли жизнь и репутация Джонни Деппа утраченными от имени всех жертв насилия, которым не верили, несмотря на то, что они подвергались насилию? А как же их обидчики? Почему Джонни Депп должен платить за это?<br>…………<br>…Давайте не будем забывать письмо о вымогательстве, где ее адвокат (Эмбер Херд) утверждает: <br>""она решительно настаивает на том, что мы делаем все возможное, чтобы этот личный вопрос не попал в поле зрения СМИ”<br>Извините, уважаемые дамы и господа из статей ""мнение"", но все, что я вижу, это лицемерное, эгоцентричное, агрессивное отношение женщины, фокусирующейся на своем имидже и средствах массовой информации, а не на доказательстве ее обвинений.<br>……………….<br>Потому что если он невиновен (а я верю, что он невиновен), он жертва мстительной женщины (и ее приятелей), средств массовой информации и тех, кто ревнует, что у него больше денег, чтобы тратить, чем у них. Но он не абьюзер.</p>
<p>Я могу игнорировать все вышесказанное и решить осудить Джонни Деппа в качестве примера, потому что он богат и знаменит. Но, позвольте мне сказать вам, это не остановит насильников. И это также даст возможность лжецам. Так чего же можно добиться, осуждая, возможно, невиновного человека? Жертвы, следующие примеру г-жи Херд, окажутся в тяжелом положении.</p>
<p>Почему я защищаю Джонни Деппа? Потому что ПОВЕДЕНИЕ ЭМБЕР ХЕРД И СМИ /СОЦИАЛЬНЫЕ СЕТИ СДЕЛАЛИ ЕГО ЖЕРТВОЙ. И черт возьми, я всегда буду поддерживать жертву.</p>

57,StarterPetitionUpdate,26326376,2020-04-11T21:55:16.000Z,,ДЖОННИ ДЕПП - ЖЕРТВА АБЬЮЗА (НАСИЛИЯ),"<p>Дорогие друзья!</p>
<p>Предварительно нам хотелось бы написать несколько слов о продвижении петиции. У Джонни десятки миллионов поклонников по всему миру. Многие бы поставили свою подпись  под этой петицией, но они ее просто не видят. Если внести  хотя бы небольшой взнос за продвижение петиции (справа красная табличка), Cfange.org представит ее более широкому кругу заинтересованных людей. И количество подписей может существенно увеличиться. У Джонни сейчас невероятно трудная ситуация сложилась, ему нужна помощь.</p>
<p>Теперь, собственно, моя статья, опубликованная в моем блоге Живого журнала, с небольшими изменениями.</p>
<p>Джонни вне кино, в обычной жизни не только слишком скромный, но и очень застенчивый, стеснительный, что делает его очень беззащитным. Поэтому он часто оказывался в роли жертвы. Отношения, в которых страдает мужчина, являются нередкими. При этом он очень смелый человек, борец.</p>
<p>Но борьба такого человека, как он, с абьюзером, тираном невозможна. Психологи говорят, что главное, о чем должна знать жертва - изменить поведения своего тирана она не способна. Существует только один способ избавиться от абьюзера – бежать без оглядки, полностью разорвать отношения с ним, выбросить все номера телефонов, адреса, нигде с ним не перекрещиваться.</p>
<p>Насилие запрещено в отношении личности любого человека. Но, не смотря на то, что законы изменились, поведение людей осталось прежним.</p>
<p>Абьюз может существовать везде - дома, на работе, в любом месте. В психологии выделяют три основных вида абьюза: физический, психологический и сексуальный. Чаще абъюзеры и их жертвы не подозревают, что они таковыми являются. Лишь некоторые осознают это. Если абьюзер захочет стать обычным человеком, один он с этим не справится, нужна помощь специалиста.</p>
<p>Абьюз несет только негатив, может вызвать психические заболевания, загубить жизнь. Считается, что черты абьюзера и жертвы закладываются в детстве. Родители должны это ЗНАТЬ. Ссоры родителей, плохие отношения оставляют шрамы на психике ребенка. Неустанный контроль над ребенком, давление на психику, побои - тоже. Из таких детей и вырастают абьюзеры и их жертвы. Джонни в детстве подвергался насилию со стороны своей матери (у нее были определенные проблемы).</p>
<p>Кто угодно может попасть в абьюзивные отношения - это может быть и уверенная в себе женщина и сильный мужчина. Начинается все прекрасно. Но по истечению определенного времени жертва уже не замечает насилия над собой, пока оно не переходит все рамки и не становится опасным.</p>
<p>В данном случае абьюзером Джонни является его бывшая жена Эмбер Херд. Они где-то год прожили вместе, и этот год оказался для него настоящей пыткой, хотя он любил ее поначалу. Это проявлялось в физическом, эмоциональном, психологическом насилии. Казалось бы, как это женщина может избивать мужчину, наносить увечья. Оказывается, может. По ее вине он несколько раз был на грани жизни и смерти. Потому что она абьюзер, а он – жертва, он не в состоянии поднять на нее руку, ударить, поставить на место. Это может быть под силу только специалисту-психологу. Но самое страшное заключается в том, что она опорочила, оклеветала Джонни, двери киностудий стали для него закрываться, его карьера оказалась под угрозой.</p>
<p>Эмбер оказалась очень изощренным и циничным абьюзером. Она подала в суд иск на Джонни, в котором обвинила его в домашнем насилии и потребовала с него крупную сумму денег. То есть, все перевернула с ног на голову. И у нее очень мощная поддержка.</p>
<p>Херд подала свой клеветнический иск через несколько дней после трагической смерти мамы Джонни, к чему он отнесся крайне болезненно. Не смотря ни на что, он очень любил свою маму. Джонни говорил, что каждый день ему было невыносимо больно. Тяжелые страдания привели его к мысли о самоубийстве. Но он удержался на краю пропасти.</p>
<p>На суде Джонни молча выслушал всю клевету и оскорбления в свой адрес, не сказав ни единого слова в свою защиту. Он не мог говорить. Если его попросят сказать тост на празднике, то это, по его словам, для него катастрофа. Он невероятно застенчив. Так какой же катастрофой должна быть для него речь на суде? К тому же он долгое время надеялся, что все утрясется.</p>
<p>Джонни очень скрытный человек и не позволяет заглянуть себе в душу. Конечно, ему очень трудно, и он очень переживает. Только в относительно недавно написанной песне ""New Threat"" -""Новая угроза"" он смог выразить свои чувства... Он пишет: Мой подарок тебе, моя новая угроза. Сильный стук, тик-так, остановка сердца ... прощай"".</p>
<p>Джонни никогда такого не писал, поэтому все это очень настораживает… Его нельзя кинуть. Он прощается с жизнью - как же мы такое допустили? Погаснет огонек - и все - не дай Бог!</p>
<p>Сейчас ситуация еще больше усугубилась. Эмбер Херд сделала клеветнические заявления на суде о том, что Джонни якобы проявлял по отношению к ней и сексуальное насилие. Суд планирует рассматривать эти заявления в июле 2020 при закрытых дверях.</p>
<p>Сейчас такая техника, прослушка и т.п., что ЛЮБУЮ ПРОВОКАЦИЮ можно было бы упредить, если бы у Джонни была Госзащита, которую требует петиция SAVE THE LIFE OF JOHNNY DEPP and his CAREER!!! Его просто осудят, не дай Бог, да еще по такой статье! если мы не приложим усилий.</p>
<p>Кроме петиций и разъяснений в публикациях, кем Джонни Депп является на самом деле, выступлений против его недругов, вернее, нелюдей, нам сложно чем-то помочь. Но общественность - это огромная сила. Миллионы поклонников - не молчите! Он со слезами благодарности принимает любую помощь и будет вам бесконечно благодарен за нее... </p>","{'id': '223544276', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/kr/jw/OukrJwyJoMLxxgk-800x450-noPad.jpg?1586642118', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

<p>А теперь ПРОДОЛЖЕНИЕ Истории про чартер с Джонни Деппом</p>
<p>Часть 7</p>
<p>ДЖОННИ И ДРУГИЕ<br>А тем временем флирт между мной и Старлингом набирал обороты…<br>Старлинг - это человек оркестр, человек - фейерверк!<br>Повстречавшись с ним, вы и не заметите на какой из первых 10 минут знакомства вы успели открыться ему,<br>он и мертвого расположит к себе и заставит смеяться…<br>Его образное мышление, фантазии, юмор, обояние и дружелюбность - это оружие, против которого очень трудно устоять.<br>В то же время Старлинг ОЧЕНЬ внимательный, он все сечёт. Армия и годы работы телохранителем оставили свой профессиональный дефект, поэтому он все время прибывает в легкой паранойе.<br>Старлинг гипер-активен по жизни.<br>Помню он как-то сказал: - многие принимают допинг для того, чтобы получить эффект, в котором я прибываю постоянно, поэтому я просто покуриваю травку.<br>И вот, Джонни спит у себя.<br>Стив, братья «из ларца» и еще пару человек, которые пришли с ними под утро из клуба, пошли спать кто куда.<br>Еще было пару молодых девушек. Они, индус и Старлинг остались в салоне.<br>Индус еще под эффектом чего-то немного странно себя ведет…<br>Девушки попросили апельсиновый фреш, Старлинг попросил смузи. Я спросила индуса, желает ли он чего-то, он оторвался от телефона поискал меня глазами и сказал что не хочет.<br>Но я знала, стоит мне стукнуть стаканом с соком об стол, как он попросит тоже самое, он всегда так делал, а потом этот сок стоит еще два часа нетронутым и мы выливаем стакан за стаканом.<br>За это и за его нечистоплотность я его немного невзлюбила сразу.<br>Я принесла заказ, беру стакан с соком с подноса и наблюдаю за индусом… это как кнопка, которая работает безотказно.<br>Как только стакан приземлился на стол, индус подскакивает и говорит: - мне тоже сок!<br>Конечно же я выдавила ему его заранее, была готова…<br>Но в этот раз подскакивает и Старлинг, мне показалось он тоже ждал этого момента:<br>- Эй, чувак! Она 5 минут назад спросила тебя, хочешь ли ты сок, ты сказал что нет. Ты что ее гоняешь как девочку? Где уважение?<br>Я немного опешила первые пару секунд, индус смотрел на меня и на Старлинга в полном замешательстве, его ещё не отпустило с ночи.</p>
<p>И тут я развернулась к Старлингу и послала ему громкий воздушный поцелуй, затем повернулась к индусу и показала язык.<br>Раздался дикий смех, обстановка была разряжена.<br>А Старлинг смеялся, смотрел на меня и сказал:<br>- That’s my girl!!!<br>С тех пор индус поменял свое отношение и как-то даже старался заговорить и пошутить со мной… и я стала по-тихоньку отвечать ему взаимностью…<br>Давайте тогда по такому случаю дадим ему уже какое-то имя, например Джамшут… как вам?</p>
<p>Часть 8</p>
<p>Я уже говорила, что Джонни любит играть и когда ему подыгрывают?<br>Ну вот...<br>Джонни пил в основном Вино, о котором я уже упоминала и его любимый коктейль Блади Мери. Причём коктейль я стала видоизменять постепенно: меньше водки, но больше табаско, чтобы он этого не ощутил.<br>В очередной из вечеров собирается он уже выходить на корму, чтобы прыгать в тендер шейха. Задерживается в мейн салоне, аккуратно берет меня за локоть снизу и говорит, своим низким, загадочным голосом: Мисс Лара, можно мне стакан специального молока? (Miss Lara, may I have a glass of special milk, please?) и так, прищурив глазки улыбается, давая понять: поймёшь ли ты, чего я хочу на самом деле.<br>Мне, как человеку, выросшему в условиях выживания и зависимости от настроения взрослых в семье, легко улавливать полунамеки. Я это называю - частью эмпатии.<br>Так вот, я уловила тонкость намёка, и тоже улыбнулась ему, прищурив один глаз.<br>Рядом стояла стюардесса Милисса. Я не успела оглянуться, как она, на своих двух длинных ногах умчалась наливать Джонни молоко. Я была уверена, что застану ее в пентри за этим занятием и оказалась права ?<br>Говорю: Милисса, он не этого хочет. А она, барышня с горячей кровью, мол: -в смысле не этого, ты что не слышала что он сказал?<br>Говорю: - подожди, я кое-что сделаю и мы спустимся вместе, ты со стаканом молока, а я со своим. Милисса злится, я улыбаюсь... ?<br>Сделала я по быстрому коктейль, а сверху обмотала стакан белой салфеткой.<br>Идём с Милиссой в мейн салон.<br>Говорю:<br>-Джонни, так какое специальное молоко ты хотел? Это, - показываю на стакан Милиссы, - от береговой коровы, а это, - показываю на свой, - он нашей, ЯХТЕННОЙ ?<br>И Джонни разразился смехом, сверкая своими серебристыми коронками...<br>С тех пор, напиток с кодовым названием SPECIAL MILK ?, стал шлягером на весь период прибывания Джонни с нами...<br>Читаем отзыв Джонни в нашей книге отзывов</p>
<p>И Джонни частенько уезжал с нашими стаканами на другую лодку, а оттуда привозил стаканы и бокалы подороже. ? один такой синий бокал, ручной работы, из толстого, дутого стекла, с пузырьками внутри, я забрала домой, он был моим любимым. Пока не разлетелся об кафель на миллионы осколков.</p>
<p>Часть 9</p>
<p>Утро. Я начинаю рабочий день, а у Джонни уже оказывается посетители.<br>Я так и не поняла кто именно это был, но говорили они о сценарии следующего фильма...<br>Старлинг ходит по периметру палубы со сдвинутыми бровями и напряженным лицом и я понимаю, что это серьезная встреча и мешать не стОит... поэтому стою на дистанции , если вдруг им что-то будет нужно...<br>Спустя время Джонни встаёт из-за стола и погруженный в мысли проходит мимо, не замечая меня...<br>Я вижу, что он успел просыпать на столе и кресле табак... Джонни курит исключительно самокрутки... ну или гашиш <br>Подхожу к столу, спрашиваю гостя, не желает ли чего и между делом аккуратно собираю тряпкой табак в кулачок...Дело сделано! Разворачиваюсь чтобы уйти и вижу, что Джонни остановился сзади меня смотрит что я делаю, делает невинное лицо, провинившегося малыша и говорит:- Мисс Лара, я понятия не имею кто это сделал...</p>
<p>Я сдерживаю смех и говорю: - Оооо, не беспокойся, Джонни. Сегодня передавали странный ветер из пустыни, который вместо песка принёс из Африки табак, какого-то чёрта...</p>
<p>Откуда ко мне пришла эта информация... хз... но Джонни разразился смехом и сказал:- тебя нельзя не обнимать...легонько приобнял меня, заставив улыбнуться даже серьезного гостя за столом, и я оставила их работать.</p>
<p>После обеда, когда все дела были решены, Джонни взял свою волшебную гитару, подключил ее к квадратной колонке Marshal и начал наигрывать разные мелодии.<br>Я стояла в уголке, прислонившись к стене, не попадая в его поле зрения, наблюдала за его движениями, слушала музыку, которую он создавал и прониклась такой чистой, братской любовью к нему.</p>
<p>Пришёл Старлинг, увидел меня, я просияла ему улыбкой, полной всех этих ощущений.<br>Он присел на диван, рядом с Джонни и начал петь, типа РЭП, песня была из репертуара «еду на ишаке, что вижу, то пою». Он любил такие экспромты и как любой, гиперактивный ребёнок, вставлял это, где было можно. Джонни быстро подхватил ноты и спокойная мелодия перешла на веселый, несуразный мотивчик. Атмосфера в салоне сразу оживилась, я подошла ближе и облокотилась на спинку стула. Лицо мое почти трещало от несходящей улыбки. Рядом встала и Франческа, затем подошла и Кармен, ещё одна стюардесса. Публика была готова слушать это часами. Старлинг начал петь обо мне и в полном смысле слова просто комментировать всё, что видел.</p>
<p>- Вот тут стоит Лара, на руке у неё часы с кожаным, коричневым браслетом, я рад видеть ее улыбку.... ну все в таком духе...<br>Джонни играет и смеётся... подмигивает мне... он уже в курсе о том, что Старлинг выделил меня среди всех...<br>Я краснею в смущении...<br>Мы все смеёмся до слез...</p>
<p>Часть 11</p>
<p>Старлинг очень любил смузи и я с радостью делала для него каждый день с новыми ингредиентами, а он угадывал что там.<br>После этого он иногда заходил на пентри с пустым стаканом, решительно шёл на меня отодвигая в угол, помню когда он сделал это впервые, у меня аж давление поднялось за секунду <br>Потом он разворачивался к умывальнику и мыл после себя стакан</p>
<p>Каждое утро, ну или то время, которое считалось утром для Джонни, я выносила приготовленную для него тарелку с нарезанными фруктами и стакан со свежевыжатым, апельсиновым соком, молча ославляла это перед ним, давая понять, что это нужно опустошить. А он улыбаясь благодарил, показывая, что получает удовольствие от заботы.</p>
<p>В очередное такое «утро», я вышла на смену.<br>Джонни уже сидел на диванчике и общался с Сани.<br>Увидев меня, поздоровался и улыбаясь произнёс свою любимую фразу:<br>- Miss Lara! May I have a glass of spacial milk, please? (- Мисс Лара! Можно мне стакан космического молока, пожалуйста?)</p>
<p>В 11 утра... Я приподняла левую бровь, (правая у меня не понимается) и говорю:<br>- Джонни, пастух увёл нашу корову на пастбище, я сейчас отправлю за ним матроса. Ну ты же понимаешь, пока они вернутся, пока мы подоим корову, пройдет немного времени. Поэтому, чтобы скрасить твоё ожидание, я принесу тебе тарелку свежих фруктов и сок, к тому времени, как ты закончишь, - молоко с пенкой будет готово... Джонни и Сани взорвались смехом, а я удалилась за обещанными фруктами.</p>
<p>Оставив тарелку и сок на столе, я стала делать обход и проверять, всё ли девочки убрали должным образом.<br>Время от времени проходила мимо них и поглядывала на тарелку. Джонни завидев меня, толкал Сани локтем и просил помочь осилить завтрак. А я сдвигала брови и говорила:<br>- я все вижу!<br>Нам нравилась эта игра и у Джонни всегда появлялась сияющая улыбка на лице.<br>Я практически была мамкой для него. Но меня он называл сис, а вот мамкой начал называть Франческу.<br>Помню, когда он сказал ей это впервые, она спустилась в крюмесс, где обедал весь экипаж и с возмущением в голосе сказала:<br>- не, вы это слышали? Он называет меня «МАМ»... какая я ему мам? Я бы его трахнула, а он меня мамой называет...</p>
<p>Экипаж накрыла волна истерического смеха. А кэп, в своём брутальном репертуаре, сказал, что заплатит тому, кто захочет ее трахнуть... он был ее другом, но унижал при всех как никто и никогда...</p>
<p>ПРОДОЛЖЕНИЕ СЛЕДУЕТ... скоро будет весело</p>
<p>Часть 12я</p>
<p>День позора.</p>
<p>Обычный вроде день.</p>
<p>Я общаюсь с ирландцами телохранителями.</p>
<p>Затем приходит Старлинг и говорит: - я кое-что заметил.</p>
<p>и взглядом показывает на Франческу, стоящую в метрах 20 и болтающую с кем-то из экипажа.</p>
<p>Я сначала не совсем поняла о чем он...</p>
<p>А он продолжает:</p>
<p>- я не хочу чтобы у тебя были неприятности... но и не хочу чтобы ты думала, что я парень для всех... я просто хочу чтобы ты это знала... чтобы тебе не показалось, что я уделяю внимание ещё кому-то... Я немного опешила. Это было серьезное заявление, как по мне. Быстро переварив информацию, я улыбнулась и сказала:</p>
<p>- мне нравится это твоё качество. Ты очень внимательный мужчина.</p>
<p>Он просиял... После этого я как идиот, весь день ходила с несходящей улыбкой на лице и даже сделала пару глупостей �</p>
<p>Но вот они снова собираются на лодку шейха, сегодня почему-то раньше, чем обычно, ещё светло, около пяти вечера...</p>
<p>Я стою на корме, как солдат, как всегда.</p>
<p>Джонни присел и обувается. Тут на отвороте джинс он увидел приклеенный пластырь, с удивленным видом отклеил его, сложил дважды, поднялся, подошёл ко мне и говорит:</p>
<p>- мисс Лара! Я не знаю откуда это, оно было приклеено на мои джинсы. Ты не могла бы выбросить это?</p>
<p>И тут, я беру у него пластырь, прижимаю к себе и говорю:</p>
<p>- я оставлю его себе на память.</p>
<p>Клянусь, я не собиралась делать такого идиотизма. Но какого хрена я вообще так пошутила, откуда этот бред пришёл мне в голову... хотя что тут удивительного, время от времени он посещает меня... но в это раз, очень не вовремя, мать его... Надо было видеть лицо Джонни. Он отпрянул от меня. В глазах появилось явно выраженное недоверие, смущение и смятение...</p>
<p>У меня в голове пронеслись разные сумасшедшие истории про то, как одна Стюардесса собирала волосы Бийонсе в душевой и потом хотела продать их на каком-то аукционе и разное другое.</p>
<p>Когда я поняла ЧТО и КОМУ я только что сказала, лицо мое залила бордовая краска в секунду.</p>
<p>Я тут же сделала шаг ему на встречу и пролепетала:</p>
<p>- Джонни прости! Это была очень глупая и неудачная шутка. Я бы в жизни не сделала такого... не знаю зачем я сказал этот бред и почему я решила, что это будет смешно для тебя...</p>
<p>Я была готова провалиться сквозь землю. Он видел это и сразу сменил гнев на милость. Улыбнулся, обнял меня и сказал:</p>
<p>- It’s ok, sis! Shit happens!</p>
<p>Оооо, как же я дерьмово себя чувствовала после этого, думала съем сама себя без остатка…</p>
<p>11-е октября<br>Я выхожу на смену немного раньше обычного.<br>Поднимаюсь в пентри. Все убрано, чисто, новых записей на борде нет. Проверяю холодильник: девчонки все заполнили.<br>Прохожу через салон, народ сидит в телефонах, здесь тоже все чисто. Выхожу на палубу с большим столом.<br>Сегодня солнечный, но ветреный день. В воздухе первые нотки осени, напоминающие о том, что каникулы закончились.<br>Джонни сидит на софе, курит и общается со Стивеном.<br>Я смотрю на него прощальным взглядом, таким, который хочет ухватить каждый микро момент и внести в память настолько детально, насколько это возможно. «Завтра заканчиваются его и наши «каникулы»» - думаю я и улыбаюсь с легкой грустинкой.<br>Очки от солнца, серая рваная футболка, кусок рукава оторван, этим кусом завязан собранный край футболки в самом низу. Его любимая жилетка, он почти не расстается с ней. Множество браслетов, перстни… «интересно, он снимает их, когда ложится спать?». Ветер настойчиво поднимает пряди его волос, игнорируя средство для укладки, а он медленным движением возвращает их назад.<br>Он сидит в полуоборота к Стивену, правая лодыжка его закинута на левое колено. Он говорит спокойно, своим низким бархатом, как обычно не разделяя некоторых слов.<br>Я улыбаюсь. Закрываю глаза.<br>Сигаретный дым и Savage Dior закрепляют в моем подсознании все отсканированое глазами. С этого момента именно этот образ будет всплывать в моей памяти каждый раз, когда я буду подносить к лицу флакончик этого парфюма в дьюти фри и станет причиной моей загадочной улыбки)))<br>Неожиданно сзади подходит Старлинг:<br>- Ну что ж, мисс Лара, - говорит он заигрывающим тоном. - наш последний день сегодня, ты будешь по мне скучать?<br>- Но сейчас то вы еще здесь! - говорю я с иронией. - поэтому я подумаю об этом завтра!<br>- Обожаю тебя! - говорит он и смотрит на мои губы.<br>Я просияла)))<br>- Как вы могли выбрать эту дату для отъезда? Это не справедливо! - говорю.<br>- А что не так с этой датой? - тут же сдвинув брови, спрашивает он.<br>- Это мой день рожденья,- говорю улыбаясь<br>- Ты серьезно? - брови его достигли наивысшей точки лба.</p>
<p>- Зачем мне обманывать? - смеюсь)))</p>
<p>- Что ты хочешь в подарок? - вполне серьезно спрашивает.</p>
<p>Я в полном замешательстве…. - ЫЫЫЫ… я не думала об этом….<br>- Come ooooon, Lara! Seriously! (Приходи, Лара! Шутки в сторону!)<br>- Удиви меня! - говорю.<br>Вряд ли я снова скажу эту фразу мужчине))) Днем они уехали на яхту к шейху.<br>Вернувшись вечером, Старлинг прискакал в пентри с бутылкой Вдовы Клико, которую позаимствовал у шейха и поздравил с наступающим днем рожденья. Конечно, первое ощущение внутри было - разочарование. Это все равно, что подарить художнику с опытом акварельные краски. Но я быстро взяла себя в руки: во первых - у него нет никакой возможности выйти с лодки, он привязан к Джонни, во вторых - мы с ним не в отношениях (пока), ну и в третьих - если не знаешь чего хочешь, не удивляйся потом что получаешь «сюрприз».<br>Они все быстро разбежались по своим каютам, вышли нарядные, надушенные и готовые к последней тусовке на Ибице перед отъездом.<br>Джонни навел смоки айз пожирнее.<br>Старлинг сменил шорты на джинсы. Подошел ко мне взял крепко и многообещающе за локоть снизу и шепнул на ухо: - дождись меня!<br>Я посмотрела на него с ухмылкой, слегка приподняв бровь, но он был настолько увлечен собравшейся и торопящееся компанией, что похоже не понял, что это значит....</p>","{'id': '223534174', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/iv/jc/SsIVJCItDBoNAfN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1586519316', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against
59,StarterPetitionUpdate,26297504,2020-04-08T21:08:30.000Z,,История про чартер с Джонни Деппом,"<p>larafelice77 (в «Инстаграме») провела несколько месяцев в обществе актера в 2016 году. Девушка работала на яхте, которую взял в аренду Джонни. Пунктуация и орфография автора сохранены для большего погружения в историю :-)</p>
<p>Часть 1я</p>
<p>Работала я на старейшей яхте 20 лет со дня постройки, для меня это было конкретно опуститься на 10 уровней ниже, но мне нужна была работа...<br>Интересный был опыт... может напишу об этом когда-то более подробно...<br>Контракт у меня был сезонный, до конца октября, поэтому я планировала по окончанию контакта полететь в Америку, чтобы искать работу на зимне-карибский сезон...<br>Обычно я ищу работу во Франции на летний, это был первый раз, когда я решилась отправиться в Америку на поиски, так решила уже в июле и начала планировать...<br>Сезон на старой яхте проходил на в основном в Испании, Ибица и Майорка... я влюбилась в Майорку, влюбилась окончательно и бесповоротно!<br>После прекрасной, но сухой Франции (в плане отношений с людьми, в основном с французами), но об этом напишу когда-то отдельно...<br>Так вооооот...<br>Майорка согрела меня своим дружелюбием, жизнерадостностью жителей, отзывчивостью и душевным теплом, об этом тоже отдельно!<br>Сезон был тяжёлый, но интересный... и вот, когда вроде он уже заканчивается, идёт простОй, на якоре две недели, вдруг капитан приходит и говорит, у нас намечается чартер... на две недели... конец сентября ?... все устали?... а он:<br>- У нас возможно будет голливудская звезда и так хитро улыбается... но, говорит, скажу с кем, когда будет подписан контракт...<br>- ок!<br>Джёмс!</p>
<p>Через пару дней собирает митинг и говорит: чартер на две недели с Джонни Деппом...<br>Пауза... мы перевариваем...<br>Первой начала смеяться я ?... Джонни Депп на на нашей развалюхе... хахаха!?<br>Но мы готовимся, не верим, но поем каждый день: Johnny, la gente está muy loca!!! (Джонни, люди очень сумасшедшие !!!)<br>Первый день чартера, все надели парадную форму с эполетами, ждём весь день... никто не приехал!<br>Ждём второй день, все на стенд бае... вечером приезжают какие-то странные люди, один чёрный американец, один индус, и два наполированных качка араба, которые говорят между собой то на арабском, то на итальянском...?�ﾽепонятная сборная солянка.</p>
<p>Ходят по яхте, смотрят все каюты, я сопровождаю, показываю!</p>
<p>Арабы делают важный вид, меряют меня с ног до головы не однозначными взглядами... я наблюдаю и недоумеваю немного...<br>Смотрят каюты, тут чёрный чувак выходит из самой простой каюты и кричит: ваааааууу! У меня будет своя ванная!<br>?<br>У меня первая мысль: о Боги, кто эти люди? Какой Джонни Депп??? ?��олный конфуз...<br>Ушли, сказали, что заедут сегодня ночью...<br>Мы стояли на стенд бае до 2х утра...<br>Потом я ушла спать и оставила на стенд бае ночную стюардессу, сказала: приедут, если много людей, буди меня...<br>Меня никто не разбудил... утром выхожу, надпись на доске, где мы оставляем друг другу сообщения: Джонни в каюте, на борту шесть человек... Я долго смотрела на борд... я была уверена, что Кристина так пошутила... обед...<br>Выходит Джонни... а я стою, как столб, осел и баран одновременно ?... и очень хочется, чтобы меня кто-то не просто ущипнул, а двинул чём-то по голове, чтобы я поверила, что это правда...<br>Я за 12 лет опыта работы на яхтах никогда в жизни так не делала сервис... принесу, брошу и убегу, Джонни мне что-то говорит, а я убегая, в стиле «галоп», кричу ему yyeeeeessss siiiirrrrrrrr ?<br>В общем, чувствовала я себя полной дурой, и ничего с этим поделать не могла...<br>Второй день тоже самое...<br>Не могу взять себя в руки, такого уровня звезду я ещё не обслуживала...<br>Он смотрим на меня, хочет заговорить, это было явно видно, а я как робкая лань в прыжке, лечу и кричу: окей, сер!!!!!<br>Идёт непонятная тусовка, какие-то люди постоянно уходят-приходят, вечером они уходят на тусовку в ночные клубы...<br>Дальше идут подробности о которых я не могу писать, не из чувства конфиденциальности, но из уважения к нему...<br>Уж больно я прониклась к этому человеку...</p>
<p>Часть 2</p>
<p>Джонни Депп...<br>История будет перемешиваться о моих ощущениях, знакомством со Старлингом и конечно же Джонни.. День второй... ужас продолжается для меня... я как цапля перебираюсь с одной ноги на другую... Джонни отходит от вечеринки, спит в своей каюте... время около 12:00...<br>Мы стоим на якоре в районе Формантерра.. Здоровый, черный чувак ходит от одного борта к другому как мороз-воевода дозор охраняя и подозрительным взглядом смотрим на туристические лодки, которые бросают якоря рядом... потом подходит ко мне... И тут всё начинается... Мы познакомились, рассказали друг другу кто откуда.<br>Старлинг из Чикаго, живет в Лос Анжелесе, работает на Джонни уже 23 года телохранителем-водителем, а в этой поездке он его ассистент-помощник.<br>Потом, не помню как, мы перешли на тему личных отношений ?<br>Я только разорвала двухлетние отношения, просто ещё вещи от бывшего не перевезла. Он тоже оказался свободным. Какое совпадение ?<br>Потом заговорили о возрасте, почему-то ? и он спросил сколько, мол, я дам ему лет, я не преувеличивая сказала 45, он поцеловал мою руку и покружил меня вокруг моей оси ?�ﾟﾘﾂ<br>Оказалось на 10 лет больше, но он в прекрасной форме и бицепс у него, как моя голова...<br>Потом заговорили про Джонни, я призналась, что не могу взять себя в руки, что сама не своя и что обнаружила троичность личности и что кроме столба, барана и осла иногда появляется дикая лань...<br>Он долго смеялся и сказал, что я обязательно понравлюсь Джонни и как-то стал странно, по-другому на меня посматривать.?<br>Сказал, чтобы я именно так вела себя с Джонни, что он обожает общаться с простыми людьми и что он большой джентльмен. И всё это оказалось правдой!</p>
<p>Затем появился Джонни, мы стали накрывать стол к обеду.<br>По правде говоря, разговор со Старлингом меня немного расслабил и я стала принимать более человеческий облик... Все садятся за стол:<br>Стивен - приятный, скромный парень, который занимается сценариями, корректировкой и ещё чем-то. Его не слышно и не видно, все время с компом и бокалом вина.<br>Два брата араба Джилло и Билло, они направлены шейхом везде сопровождать Джонни. Этот шейх и снял для Джонни нашу лодку (об этом позже).</p>
<p>эти братишки живут с детства в Италии, оба «на стиле», особенно старший Джилло Нарциссович Нарциссов: все тело тщательно депиллированно и идеально прокачено, волосы уложены волосок к волоску... постоянно старался снять при мне, то футболку, то штаны и с видом, как будто я - человек невидимка, проделывал дефиле на очень короткой дистанции от меня почему-то...? Билло тоже в хорошей форме, но скромнее...<br>Индус (мучаюсь! Забыла имя) - этот парень из британской группы поддержки Джонни, он финансист и ассистент Джонни, когда тот приезжает в Англию на звукозапись.<br>Вся звукозапись последней части «пираты Карибского моря» проходила в Лондоне...<br>И два телохранителя-викинга, два ирландца, при виде которых у меня резко поднималось давление. Два богатыря! Как же мне нравятся Ирдандцы ?�ﾟﾙﾈ? соберись, Лара...<br>Ну и конечно же Старлинг и Джонни...<br>Пока мы несли еду, Джонни успел покурить гашиш...<br>Когда все поели, девчонки стали собирать тарелки, я подошла к Джонни, его паста была едва тронута... моя бровь непроизвольно поднялась, а он сразу это узрел... он вообще очень внимательный и память у него гениальная...<br>И тут он полностью вошёл в роль Джека Воробья и в его манере произнёс: - простите мисс, наверное мне стоит курить гашиш после трапезы, иначе у меня пропадает аппетит... Пока Он это говорит, я как заворожённая откровенно-неприлично смотрю ему в рот. Зубов шесть у него действительно с серебристыми коронками...?<br>Когда он закончил, я одернула себя и не опуская брови, ответила:<br>- пожалуй Вы правы, в следующий раз я прослежу за этим...<br>Лицо его разразилось смехом, и я посчитала блестящие зубы снова...?</p>
<p>Часть 3</p>
<p>Джонни Депп и другие... Первый контакт с Джонни произошёл, первый всплеск адреналина утих... Дальше день проходил как обычно, он общался со всеми, курил гашиш и пил Vega Sicilia, за 300€ бутылочка, это его любимое вино ? и теперь моё тоже ?<br>Поэтому шутки про то, сколько он тратит на вино, совсем не шутки... На протяжении трёх недель Джонни иногда уходил в себя тремя способами: рисовал акварелью, делал записи в личном дневнике и играл на гитаре, подключённой к квадратной колонке Marshal.<br>Гитара его потрясающая, сделанная лично под него и даже медиаторы с инициалами JD. Я выклянчила у него один, пообещав, что научусь играть на гитаре... ? до гитары дело не дойдёт, но укулеле я уже купила и начала брать уроки, используя подарок Джонни.<br>Кстати, почти все окружавшие его люди называли его на американский манер - JD. Я же предпочитала - Джонни.<br>В первый день мне настолько было в кайф находится рядом с ним, что я даже не взяла перерыв на отдых.</p>
<p>Пришёл вечер... Франческа, стюардесса-массажистка с образованием остеопата... об этом можно было бы написать отдельно целую историю, но я постараюсь быть краткой, так как она является неотъемлемой частью всей истории и после окончания чартера с Джонни.<br>Франческа - крепкая итальянка, с мужской походкой, сильными руками и повышенным уровнем тестостерона до такой степени, что начала лысеть. Неухоженна как женщина, которой я часто вручала свой лак для ногтей и отправляла на перерыв, любить себя и заботится о себе. Франческа, тем не менее, любит красивых, ухоженных и спортивных мужчин, она долго их обхаживает как мужик, массирует им плечи, зовёт на кофе на перерыве, выслушивает, поддерживает, потом напаивает и трахает... но это ещё не все, что вам нужно знать о Франческе... она не просто соперничала со мной, она хотела всё моё, хотела быть мной и даже спрашивала о моих планах на будущее и спустя время слово в слово выдавала за свои... и если Франческа видела симпатию какого-нибудь мужчины в мой адрес, она из трусов выпрыгивала и делала все возможное чтобы его заполучить... и меня, возможно, это могло бы и не цеплять, если бы это реально не мешало работе...</p>
<p>иногда мне было искренне жаль ее, как человека без personality и жизненного ориентира.<br>Теперь зная все это, вы можете себе представить как Франческа с уверенностью танка направляется к Джонни, релаксирующему на софе, на открытой палубе, чтобы предложить ему массаж. ?￢ﾀﾍ♂️ Мы были вместе на смене и я стояла в стороне, наблюдая за происходящим и словила себя на том, что именно в этот момент завидую ее напористости и смелости... а мне, с моей стеснительностью оставалось стоять не далеко и греть ухо, подслушивая их разговор. Шея моя вытянулась как никогда в сторону беседующих о массаже, а ухо оттопырилось... совсем «не палевно» я выглядела...<br>Джонни этого не заметил, когда он говорит с кем-то, он был только с этим человеком... На другом конце софы сидел Индус, и оторвавшись от своего телефона, заметил неестественное положение моего тела... и тихонько позвал Джонни, показал на меня и говорит: - смотри на эту сиротку, стоит в стороне и явно хочет быть частью разговора, но стесняется... Индус посмеялся надо мной, а Джонни пригласил меня подойти...</p>
<p>Я на ватных ножках и с выражением лица как у Спонж Боба, подошла и стала сперва вольным слушателем... Джонни рассказывал о своей проблемой со спиной:<br>- на одной из съёмок, мне пришлось провисеть привязанному канатами к деревянной балке 2,5 часа, да ещё и в мокром костюме, с тех пор у меня болит вот здесь и тянет вот здесь...<br>Франческа потирает руки...<br>А я говорю:<br>- о Боги! А всем кажется, что всё так просто быть актером. Каждый думает, что его работа самая тяжёлая...<br>И тут Джонни делает круглые глаза и с выражением лица чистейшего младенца говорит:<br>- О, Ребята, ваша работа и правда тяжёлая, вы целый день на ногах, да и гости ваши, могу поспорить, часто бывают не самыми приятными... когда у меня была яхта, мой экипаж не менялся 12 лет, мои дети выросли в их компании, мы были как одна семья... я очень любил выходить в море, там я чувствовал себя свободным, сидя на носу и наблюдая закаты... потом я продал ее, а сейчас Джоан Роулинг продаёт ее и я подумываю снова выкупить... Но тем не менее, ваш труд очень тяжёлый, скажи, что я могу сделать, чтобы вы могли больше отдыхать?</p>
<p>Глаза мои стали как два блюдца, я искренне не поверила в то, что слышу! Во первых он все совсем иначе воспринял. И так же искренне ответила:<br>- Джонни, о чем ты говоришь??�ﾢвой приезд для нас праздник и честь! Я сегодня даже не пошла на перерыв, потому что атмосфера такая, как будто я и не работа вовсе, а часть вашей тусовки и весь экипаж так чувствует себя. У нас был тяжелый сезон, но мы поверить не могли в своё счастье.<br>Я рассказала ему всё, как мы не верили и ждали, как Старлинг был рад что у него свой туалет, а я стояла в шоке и думала: Боже, кто эти люди? Что происходит! Он смеялся до слез, лицо его светилось от умиления. Тут он встал и говорит:<br>- You are a doll! Можно я обниму тебя?<br>Перед моими глазами все поплыло и я увидела как проносится вся моя жизнь от этого момента до рождения... ты ещё спрашиваешь?<br>Он обнял меня крепко, в нос ударил запах табака и парфюма Dior Savage, он действительно им пользуется... так мы стояли минут 3-4-5, вечность... Ощущение было, что отпустит меня, а я так на ровных ножках и упаду как столб...<br>Он отпускает объятия, берет мою руку и целует её...<br>В этот момент моё тело превращается в воду и со всей тяжестью поддаётся закону гравитации, плюхается вниз, и превращается в лужу на палубе…</p>
<p>Часть 4</p>
<p>Джонни и другие... В этот момент капитан наш стоял на причале и наблюдал за происходящим, оказывается... Немного об этом персонаже...<br>Капитан - итальянец, довольно привлекательной внешности.<br>Бывший профессиональный фотограф, женат на русской, бывшей фотомодели, красивой женщине...<br>В начале контракта капитан был веселым, оторванным и очень радовался тому, что я подписала с ними контракт на древнюю лодку, так как это была первая чартерная и его первая лодка «большого» размера...<br>У меня к тому времени была хорошая чартерная история на яхтах и побольше этой... и кэп был Душкой, пока ему нужна была информация, советы и идеи...<br>А через пару месяцев он показал себя и свой 100%й нарциссизм во всей красе...<br>Стал претендовать не только на формальное лидерство, но и на неформальное... в ресторан в своё свободное время надо было ходить только с ним, телефоном за столом пользоваться было нельзя, курить тоже, смеяться только над его шутками, а если кто-то был веселее и интереснее, он жестко опускал и грубо унижал...<br>Все на яхте знали его жену, она часто приезжала и оставалась на яхте на недели, но это не помешало ему переспать с русской стюардессой, порвать с ней и положить глаз на меня...<br>А здесь он встретил неподъёмный шлагбаум и отношения наши, мягко говоря, «немного охладели»...<br>Потом вообще пошли эмбарго всего экипажа за одну немытую чашку в раковине...<br>В общем - это всё, что вам нужно знать о том, кто такие - мудаки...<br>А нееее... не всё... После того как мой контракт закончился он дал мне на руки хороший письменный отзыв, оставил там свой номер и емайл.<br>Спустя два года безуспешного поиска работы, кризиса и полной безисходности от непонимания, я узнала, что когда ему пишут и звонят за отзывом, он без стеснения поливает меня дерьмом...<br>2 года без работы...<br>Всё! Теперь вы знаете всё о моем бывшем капитане!<br>И вот... как только Джонни поцеловал мне руку... не знаю что происходило в этот момент со стоящей за моей спиной Франческой... может быть ее тяжелая рука уже была готова опуститься на мою, пустую в тот момент, голову...<br>Но Кэп позвал ее на причал по рации...</p>
<p>Я это заметила, но не хотела об этом думать, уж слишком была занята своими ощущениями...?<br>Мы продолжили беседу с Джонни. Я сказала, что с удовольствием работала бы на него 12 лет и что его бывшему экипажу очень повезло и если он выкупит снова лодку - я готова ?<br>Мы посмелялись... Не помню как, разговор зашёл про Индию, я подключила к нему индуса, спросила откуда он, сказала что три месяца путешествовала по Индии в одиночку, Джонни сказал, что в Индии не был, но есть такая книга, просто бомба, он в восторге от её колорита и насыщенности событий... Я спросила: Шантарам?<br>Он запнулся и с удивлением посмотрел на меня:<br>- Да! Ты читала её?<br>Я говорю, что именно в Индии иногда зачитывалась до 4х утра, чтобы проникнуться всеми событиями находясь в тот момент в самОй стране...<br>Потом сказала, что когда читала, думала о том, почему никто до сих пор не экранизировал ее и искренне сказала, что вижу его в роли главного героя...<br>Было видно, как наша беседа переходит на другой уровень...<br>Он ответил:<br>- мы хотели выкупить право на её экранизацию, но книга слишком большая и насыщенна событиями, я не вижу и не понимаю как можно там что-либо смонтировать, какие события можно убрать, там всё важно и интересно... это получится минимум трилогия, максимум мини сериал, а это большой проект и под него нужен бюджет, поэтому мы оставили эту затею и кажется кто-то выкупил уже право на экранизацию, посмотрим что из этого получится... Я была в каком-то тумане, эйфории, не верила, что этот разговор происходит наяву... я обсуждаю экранизацию фильма по книге Шантарам с Джонни Деппом... не в моих фантазиях, а наяву...<br>Ой всё!</p>
<p>Часть 5</p>
<p>Джонни и другие... Потом Джонни почему-то снова затронул тему работы на яхтах, капризы гостей и о том, как нам наверное иногда достаётся...<br>Я сказала, что всякое бывает и что самое важное - это, как все заканчивается и что я научилась задавать себе этот вопрос каждый раз, когда вроде бы попадаются говно-люди...<br>«Интересно, как и ЭТО закончится?» ?<br>И рассказала ему один из случаев, когда на одну из яхт приехала жена одного из министров России...<br>Он прервал меня фразой:<br>- I can imagine! ? (- Могу себе представить! ?)<br>Подался вперёд, и этот знакомый блеск в глазах... спаситель из треугольника Карпмана, человек, который защитит слабого, человек у которого непроизвольная реакция на такие события... ну по крайней мере так я это почувствовала, а чуть позже вы поймёте, что я не ошиблась...<br>Когда-то я и вам расскажу эту историю... после которой я увидела уважение в его глазах... он прям просиял весь...<br>Потом рассказал, как Джек - его сын, дурачился с капитаном его лодки и в процессе не понятно, намеренно или нет, но заехал кэпу ногой в пах. Кэп согнулся вдвое, а Джеку пришлось извиняться...<br>Сказал, что он очень близок со своими детьми, возможно даже слишком. Что они всем делятся с ним...<br>Уже не помню как закончился наш разговор... но Джонни снова встал и обнял меня, а я как тот волк из Диснеевских мультфильмов: когда глаза на пружинках выскакивают, язык как рулон разматывается, была готова, свистеть, орать и биться головой об столбили...<br>И это был пожалуй последний раз моей такой реакции...<br>Джонни очень тактильный человек, ему нужно взять тебя за локоть, пока вы говорите, или за руку... не всех конечно... и я думаю, была бы его воля он бы обнимался целый день с кем-нибудь ?</p>
<p>Потом мы вышли из порта.<br>Каждый вечер мы должны были следовать за яхтой шейха...<br>Изначально, Джонни был приглашён шейхом на две недели, а в итоге остался на два месяца.<br>Ему сняли огромную виллу на Ибице, на холме, с шикарным видом... но потом видимо по причине того, что Шейх хотел чтобы Джонни больше времени находился на его яхте, а Джонни любит свободу и делать что он хочет.</p>
<p>И тогда шейх нашёл такой выход: каждый вечер наша лодка следует за ними, бросает якорь не далеко от лодки шейха, и около 21:00, 22:00 от шейха за Джонни и остальными присылают тендер.<br>В первый вечер. Тендер уже ждёт, Джонни идёт на корму, обуваться.<br>В мою работу входит встречать гостей на корме и провожать, каждый раз: на прогулку ли, в ресторан ли, я там... вдруг забыли что-то, могу по рации девочек попросить найти или сама сходить, ну и пожелать приятного вечера и тд.<br>И вот, я спускаюсь и стою как солдат...<br>Джонни видимо воспринял это лично, потому что его это как-то обрадовало, говорит:<br>- ты как сестра, провожаешь в дорогу. Иди обниму!<br>С этого вечера наши обнимашки «в дорогу» стали традицией...<br>Однажды он забыл меня обнять. Они опаздывали, ребята подгоняли его. Это и был тот самый вечер, когда Джонни вышел из своей каюты с полным макияжем, смоки айз, треуголка, пластиковая сабля, в общем, тогда он и сошёл с экрана! Это был Jack Sparrow и походочкой воробья, вытягивая ножку вперёд пошёл обуваться на корму, вокруг была суета... он должен был развлекать шейха и его гостей в тот вечер, так я поняла...<br>Шёл он туда без особой охоты...<br>Поэтому в суете он прыгнул в тендер, они начали отплывать...<br>И вдруг он кричит:<br>- Мисс Лара! Мисс Лара!<br>Тендер остановили. Я была уверена, он что-то забыл в каюте.<br>А он кричит:<br>- я забыл тебя обнять!<br>Все начали ржать.<br>А я говорю:<br>- ничего! Завтра штрафной!?<br>- ну тогда я расскажу тебе один секрет. - кричит он.<br>Арабы аж рты пооткрывали.<br>Говорит:<br>- знаешь, почему королева Англии делает этот жест.<br>И делает королевский жест приветствия...<br>Говорю:<br>- нет, откуда мне знать.<br>- потому что это МОЙ ЖЕСТ!<br>Занавес!<br>Тендер медленно плыл к яхте шейха, а смех не умолкал...<br>Но это все было неделей позже, а пока... Мы вернулись в порт без них, а они пришли на яхте шейха, забежали на лодку переодеться и на всю ночь по ночным клубам…</p>
<p>Часть 6</p>
<p>ДЖОННИ И ДРУГИЕ<br>Утром я вышла на смену.<br>Франческа, которая всегда была в ночную, оставила запись на борде, которая гласила:<br>«Все вернулись утром.<br>Телохранители принесли Джонни на лодку, они все в салоне.» Захожу в салон и вижу такую картину:<br>Каждый занят чем-то своим:<br>Стив , как обычно, сидит и что-то корректирует в компе.<br>Арабы вечно что-то жрут, причем сначала это был ЗОЖ, протеин в большом количестве.<br>А потом, видимо после допинга, Билло стал захаживать к нам в пентри, причем в наше отсутсвие<br>и искать там чипсики или еще какие-то не здоровые какашечки. Я даже месседж оставила на борде для него (листай карусель).<br>Индус смотрел видео с проведенной ночи и хихикал. У него очень смешной, высокий смешок, почти женский…<br>Старлинг засыпал везде, где его голова находила какую-то поверхность.<br>А тело Джонни лежало без движения на софе и истекало токсинами…<br>Больно было то, что судя по реакции всех присутствующих, похоже что это было нормой…<br>Я раз пять прошла мимо этого зрелища и не выдержала…<br>Говорю Стиву:<br>- Ему плохо! Посмотри, с него пот градом течет! Надо что-то сделать! Снимите с него этот пиджак и кучу жилеток!<br>Стив немного подумав говорит:<br>- Не надо ничего снимать! Принеси пожалуйста холодные, мокрые полотенца и оботри ему лицо!<br>Это было второе утро на борту и я не была уверена что Джонни за человек, тем более в таком состоянии.<br>Немного смутившись, сказала:<br>- Стив, а он не зарядит мне в ухо?<br>Все разразились смехом.<br>- Нет! Не бойся! - сквозь смех сказал Стив. - Джонни и мухи не обидит!<br>- Я так и знала! Сука - Амбер! - сказала я.<br>И все заржали так, что даже Старлинг проснулся…<br>Я вернулась с ведерком для льда, водой, маленькими полотенцами и начала бережно обтирать его лицо и шею.<br>Джонни лежал без чувств, даже не шелохнувшись. И так минут 20.<br>Когда его лицо приняло более свежий цвет, я собрала свою скорую помощь, разложила все по местам,<br>а полотенца отнесла на прачку.<br>Когда вернулась, они его уже подняли и аккуратно вели в каюту.<br>Лестница с верхней палубы к каюте Джонни была полувинтовая.<br>Стив и Старлинг пошли вперед и поддерживали Джонни снизу, а я подстраховывала сверху, легонько придерживала его за плечи.</p>
<p>Вдруг посреди лестницы Джонни оборачивается и говорит мне:<br>- Ты почему меня толкаешь? Она толкает меня! - обращается он к Стиву и Старлингу.<br>- Я… Я… Я… - я чуть не села на жопу.<br>«Белка! Что делать? Как я докажу что не толкала?» - успело пронестись в моей голове. Глаза мои стали огромные и перепуганные…<br>Джонни тут же поворачивается ко мне и ПОДМИГИВАЕТ…<br>У меня аж рот открылся от возмущения…….<br>Все, что я могла выдавить из себя, было протяжное:<br>- WHAAAAAATTT???? REAAAAALLLYYY??? (- Ну и что???? Действительно ли это так???) Джонни ухмыльнулся и едва открывая рот, пролепетал:<br>- Я все слышал, Сис (с амер. сленга - Сестра)! You are a doll! (Ты просто кукла!)<br>Ребята уложили его спать…<br>Старлинг вернулся ко мне и рассказал, что у Джонни недавно умерла от рака мама,<br>мировая женщина с прекрасным чувством юмора. Джонни очень любил мать и был с ней очень близок.<br>Почти сразу после похорон, Амбер опозорила его на весь мир, подала в суд и отсудила 11 000 000$.<br>Кое что еще серьезное произошло в его жизни, но я не стану открывать никаких более личных фактов публично…<br>А о вышесказанных уже давно известно всему миру. - Вчера в клубе, он сказал мне, что наверное здесь и умрет. - Сказал Старлинг с очень серьезным лицом.<br>- А я знаешь что я ему ответил? Not on my shift man, NOT ON MY SHIFT! (Только не в мою смену, парень, ТОЛЬКО НЕ В МОЮ СМЕНУ). ПРОДОЛЖЕНИЕ СЛЕДУЕТ</p>","{'id': '223522682', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/tz/xg/ysTzxGbXYgwIFEv-800x450-noPad.jpg?1586380113', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

Карьера его была почти разрушена. Необходимо изменить общественное мнение в пользу Джонни, потому что он полностью заслуживает этого. ""Добрые люди подобны звездам, светилам того века, в котором они живут, озаряя свои времена"". Б. Джонсон. Это о Джонни.</p>
<p>В теории считается, что петиции не могут повлиять на решение суда. Но на практике такое случается. Джонни нужна только правда, только справедливое решение суда. И эта петиция может помочь Джонни, тем более, что она адресована и ему. Он бесконечно благодарен за любую поддержку и, несомненно, будет рад этой петиции.</p>
<p>Ниже помещена статья моего друга Марины Кардозо ""Прикоснуться к Божеству"". </p>
<p>""Рассказ о встрече с Джонни Деппом, 28 мая 2018 в Москве перед концертом Hollywood Vampires</p>
<p>Пишу эти слова с большой надеждой, что мало кто прочтет их, ибо личное.</p>
<p>Очередь Meet &amp; Greet с Hollywood Vampires состояла примерно из 50-ти человек, но шла быстро. За ширмами – небольшое прямоугольное пространство, освещенное с противоположного угла. Свет бьет в глаза. Первым от входа стоит Джо Перри. Он буквально находится в тени, не особо надеясь, что кто-то подойдет к нему и будет приветствовать. Подхожу сразу к Джо, обнимаю, вижу, как он довольно улыбается. Но Элис Купер - тёртый калач, его не проведешь вежливостью. Он обнимается без особенных эмоций, прекрасно понимая, что я спешу не к нему.</p>
<p>В самом углу под ярким светом, скромно переминаясь с ноги на ногу – застенчивый Джонни… Такой стройный, легкий, в белоснежной рубашке с черными письменами, видно, что ему приятно выглядеть хорошо.</p>
<p>Словно Демон в лучах ярких софитов – повернулся и сделал шаг мне навстречу… Молнией блеснула мысль: он знает, что я жду этих секунд всю жизнь. Джонни моментально подался вперед, словно тоже очень долго меня ждал….</p>
<p>Немного печальные, огромные карие внимательные глаза... очень тонкие и сильные пальцы... Очень тонкий и нежный, изящный, фото не передает как ни странно всего этого изящества, всей этой тонкости...</p>
<p>Широко открыв глаза, сдавленным шепотом кричу «Джонни!!!»</p>
<p>Это звучало скорее как «О Боже!!!!…» и напоминало Магдалину, увидевшую Христа. Во мне все замерло, совершенно исчезла всякая необходимость говорить…</p>
<p>И тут Джонни совершенно внезапно уставился на принт на моей футболке с рисунком Рауля Дюка. «Вау!» - и вот это его тихое восклицание мгновенно сняло все барьеры… Как он это делает???</p>
<p>Отношение к Джонни как к божеству больше не стояло между нами, мне вдруг стало очень легко и просто... Он смотрел на Рауля с уважением и искренним интересом… И как же было приятно видеть отражения его памяти об этом фильме в его глазах и на его лице!!!!…</p>
<p>Немного сбивчиво говорю на французском, что это рисунок, и что нарисовала много его портретов. Джонни узнает знакомый язык, одобрительно кивает. Совершенно немыслимо, непостижимо, каким-то магическим образом Джонни на расстоянии понимает твои мысли и очень глубоко и тонко чувствует твои эмоции, видит твое сердце, знает, что ты хочешь ему сказать…</p>
<p>Он потрясающе отзывчивый, и отвечает искренне теми же чувствами, что обращены к нему. Реально, это Счастье!!! Джонни – это открытый для всего самого сокровенного космический портал, и он знает все, буквально все, что ты хочешь сказать, попросить... Но ты его даже не успеешь его попросить, а он уже исполняет твою мечту!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Несмотря на то, что времени было совсем мало, Джонни внимательно и серьезно слушал, как я рассказывала про подарки ко дню его рождения.</p>
<p>Он так глубоко и точно подстраивается под любого человека и настраивает тебя одновременно на разговор своим чутким вниманием, с ним так легко.... это изумительно...</p>
<p>Мы очень крепко и долго обнялись… Как родные люди после долгой разлуки... осознаю, что это конечная и начальная точка моего существования, размыкание колоссальной силы временн0й петли, немая тоска и комок в горле от счастливых слез… вместо тысячи слов… и долго чувствую, как его тонкие пальцы вжимаются в мою спину... !!!!!!!</p>
<p>В эти секунды время остановилось, только полнейшее состояние спокойствия, ощущения, что все хорошо... абсолютное Всё и Ничто одновременно...</p>
<p>Он не отпускает тебя первый… держит тебя в своих объятиях столько, сколько ты хочешь… К счастью, никто не смеет вмешиваться, пока внимание Джонни занято общением.</p>
<p>Джонни встречает тебя как своего родного человека, которого долго не видел и безумно хотел увидеть снова... Это потрясающе... <br>И это ощущение, что все это не случайно... даже, черт меня бери, такое чувство, что Джонни ждал .... меня давно, знаю, что бред. Но чувство есть, и оно никуда не девается...</p>
<p>Как бы это глупо ни выглядело, но я постеснялся... лично взять автограф на рисунке... Конечно, мне бы хотелось, и я давно об это мечтал …</p>
<p>Надо сказать, что требование и одновременно угроза организаторов – не передавать лично подарки и не брать автографы все-таки ударили по когнитивному диссонансу. Желания и получить автограф, и пообщаться, и лично что-то подарить боролись между собой, вгоняя в панику уже перед самой встречей… но времени было катастрофически мало и пришлось выбирать…</p>
<p>Джонни наверно уже миллион раз видел свои портреты… и мои рисунки в конце концов – не бог весть что… Отнимать драгоценное время гения на то, чтобы ставить подпись? Чтобы целых две секунды следить за движением маркера??? …</p>
<p>По сравнению с самой возможностью побыть хотя бы мгновение рядом с Джонни – все эти давние мечты – о подписях и даже татуировках, вдруг становятся настолько незначительными …</p>
<p>Где-то в этот момент подыхал мой дракон тщеславия.</p>
<p>Подарки наши отдали менеджерам. В наш пакет добавилось еще два серебряных кулона, три портрета - Джонни, Купера и Томми. <br>Джонни я объяснила, как могла на своем ломаном французском - что это коллективный подарок от поклонниц из разных стран, что в подарке серебряное колье, кулоны, открытки и блокнот к его Дню рождения. Джонни удивленно и радостно воскликнул, одобрительно кивнул, и было немыслимо приятно слышать его теплое «Thanks!»</p>
<p>Вышла, совсем не помня, как сфотографировалась, и чуть даже не ушла без общего автографа, меня окликнули и вдогонку вручили фото с тремя Вампирами и их подписями. Вышла на улицу. Присела на что-то, чтобы покурить ... пока курила, начала рыдать.</p>
<p>Неизбежный Катарсис…</p>
<p>«Задавайте себе вопросы…»</p>
<p>Что мы, обычные поклонники можем делать для того, чтобы радовать нашего Джонни? Я не знаю точного ответа, но я часто думаю о том, что могло бы быть приятным для Джонни и что мы можем делать для него. На момент встречи очевидным для меня было следующее. Горячо обнять, с благодарностью посмотреть Джонни в глаза и сказать:</p>
<p>– Спасибо Тебе за твое искусство, за твою Великую душу, за твое вдохновение…</p>
<p>За то, что ты своим взглядом не перестаешь говорить нам то, что иногда нам просто не от кого услышать… ты говоришь эти слова каждую секунду, каждую минуту, каждый год, и я знаю, будешь говорить еще очень долго …</p>
<p>«Каждый вдох и каждый выдох – это победа над смертью</p>
<p>И мы каждую секунду должны её праздновать!»</p>
<p>«Продолжай дышать!</p>
<p>Двигайся вперед!</p>
<p>Будь счастливым!!»</p>
<p>Две минуты сверхпроводимости мыслей, ощущений и чувств – через голос, взгляд, прикосновения – как никогда сделали вдруг очевидными для меня все возможности и преимущества немого кино, того самого, которое так любит Джонни. Такой простой, нежный, отзывчивый, ослепительно прекрасный, добрый, беззащитный и застенчивый человек…</p>
<p>Судьба, которая сама тебя находит, когда ты нуждаешься в спасении...</p>
<p>Johnny, Thank You so much!!!<br>Marina Cardoso Fernandes"".</p>

<p>ЛОНДОН, 22 марта 2020, 22:59 — REGNUM <br>""Судебный процесс по иску Джонни Деппа к британскому таблоиду The Sun о клевете отложен из-за эпидемии коронавируса. Об этом 22 марта сообщил портал Cinema Blend. <br>Первое судебное заседание должно было пройти 23 марта 2020 года. Планировалось, что несмотря на карантиные мероприятия, проводящиеся в связи с эпидемией коронавируса, все свидетели (24 человека) всё равно дадут показания (некоторые должны были участвовать в процессе удалённо, по видеосвязи). <br>Однако Верховный суд Великобритании в итоге решил отложить разбирательство из-за того, что ключевые участники сейчас находятся в разных точках земного шара: Эмбер Хёрд — в Лос-Анджелесе, а Джонни Депп — во Франции, где власти усилили карантинные мероприятия.</p>
<p><em>Ситуацию усугубило то, что член команды юристов Деппа в настоящее время ушел на карантин из-за коронавируса. Принимавший решение судья также обратил внимание, что сложившаяся ситуация слишком непредсказуема и существует вероятность, что после того, как начнутся разбирательства, кто-то из участников процесса заболеет.</em></p>
<p>Джонни Депп подал иск против The Sun (таблоид принадлежит компании News Group Newspapers) в феврале 2020 года. В апреле 2018 года портал опубликовал статью, в которой актёра назвали«истязятелем жены» (wife beater)"".</p>

<p>«Кто я вам? Ты – Сокровище!!!»</p>
<p>Когда Джонни спросили, какой он любовник, он ответил: «Мои родители научили меня делать все, что я делаю – очень хорошо».</p>
<p>И добавил: «И я никому не делаю больно».</p>
<p>И я подумала, впервые прочитав эти слова: он так сказал потому, что это ему часто делали больно? И продолжают это делать?</p>
<p>На своем опыте знаю и уже видела много подтверждений тому, что люди очень часто внезапно становятся поклонниками актерского таланта Джонни и его магической харизмы не потому, что читали об этом в газетах, а потому, что увидели случайно его глаза… Я никогда не интересовалась ни зарубежным кино, ни тем более тем, что о нем пишут. Но однажды ночью (в довольно жесткий период моей жизни) проходя под эстакадой возле Цветного бульвара, боковым зрением вдруг заметила, что на огромном черном фоне красуются три фигуры пиратов (это была весна 2007 года).</p>
<p>И я увидела эти глаза… Черные, бездонные, притягивающие к себе, как огромные магниты…</p>
<p>Уже отойдя шагов на 20, я вдруг остановилась, развернулась и снова подошла к центральной фигуре. Эти глаза. Я стояла и погружалась в них. Плохое зрение и кромешная тень от эстакады мне никак не мешали… Мне было 36 и я не знала, как его зовут. Никогда сознательно не смотрела такие фильмы. Голливуд был для меня всегда чем-то вроде оплота Дьявола и совершенно марсианской жизнью, которой не стоит интересоваться.</p>
<p>Минут 5 я просто не могла оторваться от этой излучающей невероятное тепло улыбки – такой солнечной - в такой кромешной ночи... Это был момент, когда Джонни протянул мне руку, чтобы не дать слететь с катушек. И следующие 10 лет такие моменты иногда повторялись.</p>
<p>Дальше всё развивалось стремительно, почти как у всех. Пираты, фильмография, пересмотренная дважды за месяц. Поглощение информации о Джонни на фансайтах. Фото, собираемые в диких количествах на комп. В 2009 я уже была частью корабля и инет-фэндома.</p>
<p>По времени мне очень повезло: 2000-2010 годы стали для Джонни огромнейшим пиком славы, периодом бешеного роста популярности и активности его фанбазы. Фансайты тонули в слезах восторга.</p>
<p>Однако уже в 2009 году я была просто в недоумении, когда впервые столкнулась с довольно странными отдельными высказываниями блогеров в адрес Джонни (один ущербный на вид и судя по тексту умом дядька сказал «вообще-то Депп – мужичок страшненький»). Правда подобный перл не вызвал ничего, кроме истерического смеха. Но я удивилась крайне, что когда на экранах появился «Джонни Д.» - Деппа в инете ругали уже за образ.</p>
<p>Долгое время я предполагала, что «бомжеватый, сумрачный и дикий подросток», «маленький преступник», «мальчик для битья», «хулиган» - это как бы часть его имиджа…</p>
<p>«Джонни идут наручники», как сказал Уотерс, и всё такое… Но было и другое - Джонни ещё в ранних интервью говорил, что «Я не тот – кого из меня делают». Вот кстати скажите, люди добрые, как это совместить: с одной стороны имидж – это кодекс и каркас поведения актера – он изобретается немного искусственно и отвечает требованиям моды, рынка. Но. Исходным материалом, основой для имиджа всё-таки служат изначально имеющиеся, родные черты характера, внешнего вида актера или музыканта. Имидж утрирует, усиливает и намеренно искажает их. Это и ложь, и правда одновременно. Джонни говорит, что он только маленькая часть процесса создания кино, что он не мальчик с постера, что он не такой, как в сериале «21 Джамп стрит», что он остается самим собой. Еще он говорит, что Эдвард Руки-ножницы – это большая часть его, и что вообще все персонажи – живут внутри него и являются его частью. Ок, Гений парадоксов друг. Противоречие это может касаться только кривотолков о его личной жизни. В творчестве все сходится. Там, перед видеокамерой он всегда настоящий – это совершенно точно. Иначе бы так не цепляло…</p>
<p>В тот же 2009 год я набрела в инете на скандально известный Бертонленд, который сразу мне понравился пейрингом и полной иконографией, но было в нём и что-то отталкивающее.</p>
<p>Ужасно, но я до сих пор нахожу новые подтверждения своей интуитивной гипотезы о том, что это был заказной сайт, работавший на насаждение гей-культуры и разрушение карьеры Джонни уже тогда. В 2009 году они уже вовсю трубили, что Депп «шлюшка», без Тима он – полное ничтожество. Что вся его популярность строится только на его природной сексапильности. И тот факт, что Джонни играет так, что его родные фанаты не узнаЮт, и о нем самом на экране ни разу за фильм не вспоминают, и что актерские сокровища харизмы, манкости, магичности и безумной привлекательности Джонни заключаются не только и даже не столько в его внешности, сколько в его эмоциях, глубине жизненного опыта, его личности – просто игнорировался БЛ.</p>
<p>Особенно прискорбным оказалось то, что пропаганда гей-культуры на БЛ, (которая возможно изначально была для них самоцелью, велась крайне неграмотно, и я однажды говорила им, что менталитет нашей культуры «с тысячелетней историей» встанет стеной, а если кому нравится пейринг, могут просто наслаждаться узким кругом) – вся эта доморощенная пропаганда строилась как раз на зонтичном брендировании от бешеной популярности Джонни.</p>
<p>То есть БЛ паразитировал на нем, пиарился за его счет, и его же унижал. В 2013 году они нагло лгали, что фанбаза Джонни тает на глазах и от нее осталась только половина, гадили на Одинокий рейнджер еще до его выхода… И это в то время, как появилась специализация фан-ресурсов, увеличилось их разнообразие и количество задействованных соцсетей!!!</p>
<p>Навязанное чудовищно лживое клише об игре Джонни якобы «везде как в Пиратах» начало тотально распространяться и прочно въедалось в мозги даже тех, кто вообще не смотрит фильмы с Джонни. Одинокого рейнджера беспощадно гасили, потому что он нарушал ключевые каноны вестрена. Не лучшей оказалась судьба и фильмов «Мрачные тени», «Превосходство»… «Мордекай» до России так и не добрался. Постеры повесили, а потом сняли.</p>
<p>Уже конкретно начало раздражать, что при самых плохих сценариях и режиссуре - в «провале» фильма всегда был якобы виноват Джонни… При том, что если б его там не было, фильмы скорее всего бы даже и не окупились и понесли большие убытки.</p>
<p>Далее возникает эта свистопляска под названием «Джонни – самый переоценённый актер». На самом деле Джонни – это актёр, который всегда стремился получать справедливо нормальные деньги за свою офигенно сделанную работу. Но те, кто орут о его переоценённости, никогда не добавляют, что Джонни играет также бесплатно, отдает свои гонорары для помощи коллегам, на лечение онкобольных…</p>
<p>По большому счету никакие деньги не могут оценить достойно то, что является шедевром и вкладом в мировую культуру.</p>
<p>Так и хочется перефразировать: «Кто нам Джонни Депп? – Он – сокровище!» Это можно только выразить нашей благодарностью и любовью за его игру. Джонни часто повторяет – что его поклонники – это его боссы, что он работает ради нас. Это очень правильно и трогательно, и безусловно трепетное отношение к аудитории – это грамотный пиар-ход, но для меня важно и несомненно, что в первую очередь – это его искренняя благодарность, что мы смотрим и любим его фильмы. И да, это дикое неземное чувство счастья!!! Когда ты видишь живого Джонни перед собой, и он гордится тем, что на тебе его персонаж. И это происходит не в телевизоре и не в инете с кем-то другим, а именно с тобой и по-настоящему!!!!!</p>
<p>Можно предполагать, что Джонни периодически получает п***й от кинобоссов за неформат, и что его бы может уже давно выкинули, если б не его бешеная популярность. Реакция людей на премьерах подтверждает это. Возьмите любое видео с любой премьеры, в момент появления Джонни на публике и вы УСЛЫШИТЕ ЭТО!!!…</p>
<p>В конце концов Джонни пришел в индустрию никем, сумел там удержаться, вынести все, что связано с построением и развитием карьеры. И он благодарен своей аудитории и готов максимально отдаваться толпе за кусок хлеба с маслом. Чудовищный сюр, но вы только на секунду представьте себя на его месте. Вы смогли бы всё это выдержать - бесконечные прикосновения, объятия-поцелуи, сопли-слезы – других, незнакомых вам людей - часами??? Yes Sir, Thank you , Sir… Королева в восхищении…</p>
<p>Конечно, можно возразить - что это его работа, и что он ее делает безупречно и за деньги, тогда я отвечу: да, но разве не чудо, КАК искренне он это делает? И почему к нему все тянутся как к священной Плащанице? Невозможно подделать ТАКОЕ КОЛИЧЕСТВО ЛЮБВИ!!!! Мне иногда даже страшно предположить, что может происходить в его жизни там, вне публичности и фотокамер. Когда ему самому даже «фотосессии напоминают изнасилование…» Чем он расплачивается за то, чтобы работать там, и чтобы мы могли видеть его на экране…</p>
<p>Что касается БЛ, я соглашусь с любым самым абсурдным сюром с целью получения эстетического оргазма, с любыми самыми фантастическими пейрингами, потому что каждый поклонник имеет право мечтать о Джонни в своем ключе и получать от этого удовольствие. Но б**ть. Вместо того, чтобы просто подрочить и сказать – «спасибо, я кончил», на какой конец необходимо ещё потом плевать ему в лицо и вытирать об него ноги???</p>
<p>И без этих «поклонников» в жизни Джонни всего этого было уже достаточно… Зачем обязательно нужно втоптать его в грязь и помогать ломать карьеру? Зачем в этом участвовать??? Откуда в таком количестве берутся эти «блаженные старушки», которые подкладывают периодически дрова в костер инквизиции??? Действительно, «есть нечто средневековое в том, чтобы унизить и уничтожить гения, чьи достижения определяют целую эпоху»… и толпа, которая тебя коронует, готова потом разорвать тебя в клочья…</p>
<p>Даже если весь бред о домашнем насилии, алкоголе и наркотиках был бы правдой, все то, что постоянно взахлеб пишут о Джонни, я не стала бы это транслировать дальше никогда.</p>
<p>Для меня неважно, кто он по сексориентации: розовый или голубой, радужный, в крапинку, в полосочку…</p>
<p>Хотя и у меня есть свое вИдение этого момента, а заодно и ключевых имиджевых меток в актинге Джонни и в его публичной жизни.</p>
<p>То, что говорят о нём и делают с ним режиссёры, создало у меня определенную картину, которую я никому не навязываю, но и не подвергаю сомнению уже давно. Элементы насилия, стабильно присутствующие ракурсы в кадрах, кинк на пощечины, которые он получает чуть ли не в каждом втором фильме – последние события подтверждают, что это часть реальной жизни Джонни… «Ударь меня по лицу – я дам тебе сотку», – Джонни часто так говорит в минуту раздражения. Эти вечные синяки-порезы царапины на руках… И что может означать этот его «грязный Санчес»? Просто воздержусь от комментариев и от психотравм для читателя.</p>
<p>Можно предполагать или отрицать, на какие компромиссы с судьбой он пошёл, чтобы удержаться в бизнесе, но совершено точно, что кроме мастерства и таланта там необходимо быть исключительно гибким. «Молодые люди отлично тянутся, отправим его в тянутель тянучек» , ЧиШФ.</p>
<p>Кстати, никогда не замечали, что шутки про взбитые сливки и вечный леденец как-то мало подходят для детского фильма? Вот оно – выворачивание формата наизнанку. Тим в рамках официальной доктрины скрыто развращает детей, но в реальности дети самостоятельно это не смогут уловить, а взрослый деппхед ассоциирует эти шутки с карьерой Джонни. Вуаля, эффект достигнут.</p>
<p>Кто наверняка, кроме самого Джонни, знает, сколько и каких скелетов таится в его шкафах?… Какую боль он носит в себе, о чем не может рассказать никому? «Я продал тело, а не душу, как шлюха. Церковь прощает шлюх каждый день» (Его фильм-деточка любимая единственная – «Храбрец»). Можем ли мы упрекать его в том, чего никогда не узнаем? (Втайне я конечно всё же надеюсь на откровения в его книге, но это только надежда. Хотя… если этого хотеть долго и сильно, опыт показывает, рано или поздно надежды сбываются).</p>
<p>Что бы там ни говорили в СМИ, это уже никогда и никак не повлияет на мое отношение к Джонни. Потому что каждый день мне просто необходимо видеть черты его лица, его внутренний свет, его игру.</p>
<p>Для меня неважно, милый ли он семьянин, муж и отец семейства, гуляющий с детьми по винограднику, или парень-огонь, зависающий ночи напролет в гей-клубах со своими мордоворотами, гитарист, отрывающийся на рок-концертах или актёр, который поддерживает Мемфисскую тройку, тусит с масонами, дружит с Менсоном, любит погорячее? (Тсс… открою тайну. Это все ОН НАСТОЯЩИЙ на самом деле). Он может, умеет, успевает быть РАЗНЫМ.</p>
<p>Какой он в «обычной» жизни? Жизни, которой у него – «кот в мешке наплакал» просто потому, что почти всё его время занято делом постоянно. Даже если вам кажется, что он пьет винишко, а потом спит до двух часов дня – вы можете крупно ошибаться, потому что в это время в его подсознании идет активное построение сложных и причудливых гештальтов для своих новых героев. «То, что творится в моей голове – намного интереснее того, что происходит снаружи», – фраза Джона Уилмота, Второго графа Рочестера – в точности о Джонни, как и о любом продуктивном творческом человеке.</p>
<p>Как раз эти бессознательные процессы и есть те корни, которые дают нам возможность вкушать плоды творчества. Игнорировать это, а потом распространять об авторе негатив – это значит есть желуди и потом подрывать у дуба корни от нечего делать.</p>
<p>Да, мы не может проникнуть в таинство создания ролей, познать все тонкости его уникальных креативных процессов, но мы всегда видим их потрясающий результат, который Джонни нам предъявляет ежегодно в размере от 3 до 5 фильмов. И одно могу сказать совершенно точно.</p>
<p>Колоссальная любовь всегда помогает сделать Мастеру шедевр в стократ лучше, чем просто высокое и уверенное мастерство, пусть даже самой высшей пробы. Вот почему так хороши те же фильмы Джонни и Тима. Неважно, была ли там любовь тела. Вы можете думать об этом так, как вам удобно и приятно. Но Любовь духа там есть налицо.</p>
<p>Душа вселяется в произведение и живет там веками. Но только если у творца есть Большая Любовь. Можно назвать это божественным откровением, причастностью к Богу, чудом гениальности или результатом долгого упорного труда. Это не меняет сути. «Версий много и все правдивы. Я укажу суть». Душа создателей по божьему велению, чудом, через эфир, при помощи электромагнитных биорезонансов или ещё как-то по-другому – но действительно «вселяется» и остается бессмертной в произведении. Вы можете это уловить и даже очень сильно почувствовать, стоя, к примеру, перед подлинником Леонардо Да Винчи. Если вас трясет, вы плачете или улыбаетесь, возбуждены до мурашек, (пульс, АД, температура) и вы готовы бежать сломя голову, чтобы сделать что-то важное, вас захлестнул адреналин и ваш мотор включился как от искры зажигания – Да! это вас коснулось!</p>
<p>Игра Джонни совершенно однозначно дает такой эффект.</p>
<p>И там, где есть эта энергия, это волшебное «чуть-чуть» – туда стремятся толпы, чтобы прикоснуться, зажечься, получить заряд… И если ты художник, артист в широком смысле этого слова, это «чуть-чуть» как раз и есть главный критерий настоящести. И в твоем искусстве оно либо есть, либо нет.</p>
<p>У Джонни это таинственное, мистическое «чуть-чуть» – огого как есть. Он умеет вселять душу в свою работу. Часами не отрываясь от экрана можно смотреть на гипнотические кадры его движений, мимики, выражение его глаз, которое меняется непрерывно и бесконечно, как состояние океана.</p>
<p>Но и это ещё не все, Джонни не просто передает свое волшебство через камеру, но при благом стечении обстоятельств умеет создать магическую атмосферу процесса сразу для всей команды фильма, зажечь своим внутренним огнём огромный коллектив на съемочной площадке в 300 человек – от генерального продюсера – до незаметного техника, как было в трилогии Пиратов.</p>
<p>Те, кому все это не кажется важным, любят обычно ставить диагноз, кто же Джонни в быту – истеричный враг мебели или неприспособленный к жизни ребенок, который не может разобраться ни в своих финансах, ни в окружении. Которому нужна моральная поддержка и сильное мужское(отцовское) плечо как образец поведения и реальная помощь…</p>
<p>Но какой вообще смысл выяснять - кто он в отношении с близким окружением: доверчивый щеночек, ловкий манипулятор или хитрый и расчетливый лис? На самом деле, учитывая, насколько Джонни потрясающе разный и многогранный – подобные вопросы даже в принципе не имеют ни смысла, ни надежды на прояснение.</p>
<p>Но людям иной раз просто жизненно необходимо компенсировать свою ущербность тем, что время от времени хрюкать: «Смотрите-ка, а я ещё одно пятно на солнце нашел!!! И надо же – Джонни тоже человек со своими пороками !!!(Такой же грязный как и я, хе-хе)».</p>
<p>Какое это имеет значение для тех, кто с восторгом и удовольствием смотрит его кино, кто безумно любит его актерскую игру? Часами вглядывается в глаза и губы на его фото??? Для тех, кому Джонни помогает выжить и стать собой????</p>
<p>Джонни об этом прямо говорил: «Какая вам разница, с кем я сплю и что я ем? Вы бы лучше смотрели и оценивали мои фильмы…» Вариант просто подрочить он также рекомендовал ещё в 90-х.</p>
<p>«На самом деле важно лишь то, ЧТО ты можешь, и чего ты Не можешь». Джонни МОЖЕТ. Создавать персонажей «из ничего» (на самом деле из своего колоссального и разнообразнейшего жизненного опыта). И да, для этого ему нужны время, уединение и медитация. Что по определению оставляет меньше этого самого времени на общение с любимыми и родными людьми. Но Джонни трудоголик. Он будет в свой день рождения 8 часов общаться с онкобольными детьми. Но не придет вообще на день рождения уже к счастью, бывшей жены.</p>
<p>Во всей этой кричащей путанице ГЛАВНЫМ для меня остается всегда то, что Джонни Гений, который своей игрой дарит эйфорию, экстаз, заставляет дрожать от напряжения, пробуждает в тебе скрытые силы.</p>
<p>Просто посмотрите его фильмы, фотографии, прислушайтесь к его голосу, и ваше сердце – словно волшебная трость учащенными ударами укажет на бесценный клад, а счетчик Гейгера ваших эмоций взорвется ко всем чертям от ураганного излучения такой глубокой искренности и кристальной чистоты, такой обжигающей любви и боли, такой покорной нежности в его глазах. Тонкие черты его лица внезапно словно лезвиями полоснут ваше сердце, оставив в нем такие же следы, какие оставляют в памяти лишь святые и ангелы с полотен Тициана, Боттичелли и Эль Греко.</p>
<p>В его взгляде – чуть печальном, ласковом, невинном и застенчивом – хочется тонуть снова и снова, пересматривая его фильмы в сотый раз и каждый раз смеяться и плакать, словно впервые… Из его Волшебной страны не хочется уходить никогда.</p>
<p>Фильмы Джонни – это самостоятельная и самодостаточная Вселенная. И в ней можно совершенно свободно дышать. Получать эстетическое наслаждение. Спастись от одиночества и побороть депрессию. Расширить границы познания и заинтересоваться вещами, в которых раньше не видел смысла и пользы. Творить и общаться с близкими по духу людьми. Это неисчерпаемый и чистый источник вдохновения, это чувство возвращения к самому себе, желание понять и заново выстроить настоящего себя – необычного и уникального... Это новая оценка своего ресурса времени и его наполнения. Это понимание ценности жизни.</p>
<p>Как сказал Джонни в свой первый приезд в Москву в 2011 году: «В России мне понравились люди. Они открытые, душевные и немного ку-ку. Но это как раз в моем стиле.» Также он говорил: «Мне нравятся странные, поврежденные люди».</p>
<p>Аудитория Джонни имеет большой процент людей искусства - немного странных, но умеющих делать необычное и чуть-чуть похожих на него.</p>
<p>А её огромный размах по возрасту, национальной принадлежности, политическим и религиозным убеждениям, сексуальным ориентациям и культурным предпочтениям просто поразителен. Его любят мужчины и женщины, люди старших возрастов и дети, богатые и бедные, элита и маргиналы, с хорошим образованием и без, представители ЛГБТ и традиционных культур. И каждый считает его своим – родным, самым близким и любимым. Самоназвание фэндома – «Деппосемья» говорит уже о многом. «Это не фанаты – это все мои родственники!» - так сказал наш Кэп на съемках пятых Пиратов. И каждому в этой семье Джонни умеет дать нечто особенное, что желает видеть каждый конкретный человек. При встрече с поклонниками он может встать на колени перед девушкой, поиграть с ребенком, поцеловать руку пожилой леди… Он мечта миллионов, которая принадлежит всем. И никто не имеет права присвоить его только себе… Личная трагедия или великое счастье? Согревать весь мир – и мёрзнуть самому…</p>
<p>Почему Джонни так необходим совершенно разным, порой просто противоположным людям - тем, кто в разных уголках земного шара наряжается Шляпником, Вилли Вонкой, Капитаном Воробьем, Гриндевальдом, Эдвардом Руки-ножницы, переводит его интервью, пишет фанфики на разных языках, ведёт фан-сайты, озвучивает фильмы и видео, организует флешмобы и праздники, проводит выставки, отмечает его День рождения, рисует иллюстрации, портреты и комиксы, сочиняет музыку и стихи, просто пересматривает любимые фильмы с Джонни?</p>
<p>Потому что гений Джонни универсален и абсолютен, как Моцарт, Вивальди и Микельанджело, как Станиславский, Чехов и Шекспир, Чарли Чаплин и Маяковский, Майкл Джексон и Миядзаки.</p>
<p>Потому что в Джонни – как в волшебном зеркале – каждый находит для себя нечто очень ценное, личное, необходимое…</p>
<p>В его искусстве есть то самое классическое, чего так сильно нам всем стало не хватать – волшебства, истинной красоты и добра. Люди уже насмотрелись киборгов, акул в формалине и черных квадратов, устали от нестабильности, агрессии, ужасов и тотальной фальши. «По телевизору каждый день показывают оторванные руки и ноги»… А люди изголодались по искренним чувствам и человеческому теплу.</p>
<p>Джонни излучает потрясающую энергию любви и жизни. «Он – как солнце, почему вам не любить солнце? – сказала про него однажды прекрасная Энн – Белая Королева.</p>
<p>Что ему помогает в этом? Изречение, которое он видит на себе каждый день: «Смерть неизбежна».</p>
<p>И спешит делать Вечное, культовое и нетленное.</p>
<p>Согревать тех, кому плохо. Быть Патронусом, который в трудный момент буквально выхватывает тебя из омута безнадежности, не дает совершить непоправимое, потому что выхода нет только из гроба. Потому что себя нельзя найти, но зато можно создать. И ты начинаешь верить, что «каждый вдох и каждый выдох – это победа над смертью, и мы должны каждую секунду её праздновать».</p>
<p>Даже если ты в глубочайшей депрессии, вдруг понимаешь, что</p>
<p>Ты Можешь Сам вынырнуть, глубоко вздохнуть, снова начать двигаться и чувствовать жизнь. Изменить её в нужном направлении. Наконец стать собой. Сделать себя лучше. Даже если для этого необходимо «менять кожу» и ежедневно побеждать своих драконов.</p>
<p>Я бесконечно благодарна ему за это.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Случилось так, что мечтая стать музыкантом, Джонни однажды встал на путь актерства и следует по нему уже больше 35 лет. Он использовал каждую возможность, прилагал все усилия к увеличению своих шансов, исключительно хорошо старался делать свою работу. Несомненно – то, что он сейчас имеет – есть результат не только его стараний, но и обратной стороны жизни актера-звезды такого уровня.</p>
<p>Какова эта цена, мы не знаем. Джонни не раз говорил, что его профессия не труднее работы водопроводчика, что он готов в любой момент вернуться к продаже ручек, и что он не жалуется, что бывает трудно – ведь быть публично высеченным – это часть той игры, на которую он подписался…</p>
<p>Джонни изначально понимал, что должен быть красивым не только снаружи, но и внутри, что физическая красота – это ресурс, который закончится очень быстро, и поэтому мудро действовал на протяжении всей своей карьеры. Свои первые гонорары в кино он потратил на интенсивное обучение актёрскому мастерству. Старался приобрести как можно больше личных дружеских связей в элитной культурной среде. Он лез из кожи вон, чтобы постоянно развивать и совершенствовать свою душу, делать свои эмоции ярче, богаче и разнообразнее. Он всегда много читает и учится у больших писателей, актеров, режиссеров, музыкантов. Большинство его самых известных высказываний - это идеи великих людей, которые Джонни осознал и пропустил через себя:</p>
<p>«Уродство лучше, чем красота, потому что оно дольше сохраняется. Лучше быть уродом, чем красавцем, который постепенно превращается в урода. Кому вы нужны, если кроме красоты у вас ничего нет». Джонни никогда не строил иллюзий насчет того, что его потрясающая внешность будет гарантом стабильности в карьере и не рассчитывал на неё как на главный козырь: «Если бы моя голова была муляжом, я бы предпочитал снимать ее в конце рабочего дня».</p>
<p>Писатель Ник Тошес, которому я ему верю как себе, очень точно отметил, что у Джонни – чистая и нежная душа, и что он сумел пережить Лос-Анджелес, не сделавшись зверем. Что видимо там большая редкость. Но именно его чистая и нежная душа становится сейчас его особенно уязвимым местом, поскольку такие ценности как искренность, открытость, отзывчивость, порядочность и честность уже давно не позиционируются как приоритетные для трансляции в мире кинематографа и массовой культуре вообще. Джонни упоминал, что он довольно старомоден. И сейчас этим пользуются те, кто хотел бы краха его карьеры.</p>
<p>Любой торчащий гвоздь будет заколочен, говорят японцы. Джонни всегда сильно выделялся даже на фоне огромных талантов, красавчиков и фриков... Его достижения принесли ему не только бешеную популярность, славу, обожание, поклонение - но и их ужасную обратную сторону - зависть, ненависть, травлю - просто потому что он Лучше.</p>
<p>Можно долго анализировать факты и строить домыслы, чтобы понять почему, кто и за что сейчас организует эту беспощадную травлю. Парадигма, в которой Джонни сам во всем виноват – для меня неприемлема, поскольку даже если б он был полностью безгрешен, то во-первых, при желании компромат можно всегда спровоцировать и создать даже с нуля, а во-вторых, есть абсолютно объективные причины того, что Джонни больше неугоден и не нужен голливудской системе.</p>
<p>По экономическим причинам: это очень дорогой актёр. Можно найти моложе и гораздо дешевле. Плевать на то, что гений и национальное и общемировое достояние может просто стать бомжом, это его проблемы. Качество игры – да хрен бы с ним. Пипл будет хавать то, что им дадут.</p>
<p>Возраст: эту планку нужно уметь преодолеть и даже актёры класса Б здесь оказываются в более выигрышном положении. Я думаю, что Джонни сумеет с этим справиться, 2018 год показал его возможности Феникса в очередной раз.</p>
<p>К тому же запас лиц в карманах Джонни даже не собирался заканчиваться…</p>
<p>Основной причиной давления на Джонни, на мой взгляд является то, что он всегда был костью в горле Америки, и как выяснилось, это была не только деталь его имиджа… В предисловии к книге Бертона Джонни пишет, как благодаря встрече с Тимом «мальчик-новинка», «ободранный и затраханный, без всякой надежды на спасение из этого кошмара» – всё-таки сумел освободиться от контракта с телесериалом, чтобы попасть в Большое Кино, что впрочем само по себе стало для него ещё большим кошмаром, особенно с точки зрения требований к актеру и его жизни.</p>
<p>Собственно по его работам в кино уже видно, что все его существо сильно противоречит системе ханжеской морали в США.</p>
<p>В Одиноком рейнджере Гор Вербински и Джонни сознательно совершили переворот ценностных оснований традиционного вестерна, где индеец Тонто был незначительным персонажем, слугой, а человека из высшего общества нельзя было выставлять в неприглядном свете, и тем более армию США показывать тем, кем они и были на самом деле: орудием геноцида индейцев. Гор и Джонни нарушили это всё. Тонто стал важнее самого рейнджера. Мальчик слушает в музее правду об истории страны и не верит своим ушам. Справедливость торжествует, как и в Пиратской саге Гора. В конце фильма - стеб над традиционными концовками предыдущих вариантов. А чего стоили одни эти фразы: «Я не варвар! – Ты даже не мужчина!», «Если закон защищает преступников – то я буду вне закона!!!», «В темный час, Кемосабе, воины добра надевают маски!». Не менее крамольным с точки зрения самого сюжета был и мультфильм «Ранго».</p>
<p>Ранний фильм «В последний момент» был объявлен провальным. Действительно, зачем портить «облико морале» госслужб – на выборах охрана куплена и намеренно пропускает человека с оружием, чтобы тот убил губернатора. Сделан фильм вполне качественно, задуман как просмотр в режиме реального времени, смотрится на одном дыхании. Джонни потрясающе сыграл и прыгал сам без дублера с 10 метров высоты.</p>
<p>«Храбреца» на редкость не любил никто и никогда. А ведь это настоящий качественный артхаус. Да, там есть технические недочеты. Но это острое как бритва, уникальное и редкое кино. В среде поклонников вызвало много споров и рассуждений. Кустурица сказал о нём – «Ты сделал в США первый коммунистический фильм». Джонни говорил, что «всегда болел за неудачников». А сострадание и милосердие – это конечно совсем не то, что нужно современному человеку. Лузера следует добить, а не помочь ему. Совершенно «не те» ценности несет в себе этот фильм. Стоит ли удивляться, что на фильме такое табу, что от него до сих пор все бегут как чёрт от ладана из соображений как бы чего не вышло и от греха подальше. Помню, ещё ребенком в брошюрах 80 года «Знание-сила» читала о том, что в США есть снафф. Учитывая, что режиссеру предыдущей экранизации повести Г.Макдональда «Смельчак» это стоило жизни – вполне можно сделать вывод, что на самом деле Джонни очень ловок и живуч. Он действительно любит рисковать и ходить по лезвию ножа.</p>
<p>Иногда он был совсем неосторожен, особенно когда публично сказал, что США ещё молодая страна и кусает всех как щенок, чтобы самоутвердиться… Похожее высказывание он обронил летом 2017 года на фестивале в Англии – «Когда в последний раз актёр убивал президента?» Правда Джонни тотчас же извинился.</p>
<p>Фильм «Распутник» долго не выходил и в конце концов был приостановлен в прокате США «легендарным» Вайнштейном, который по словам Джонни – просто убил этот фильм. Флаеры со слоганом, предложенным Джонни: «Я вам не понравлюсь» были резко отвергнуты.</p>
<p>Можно понять, почему система больше не хочет видеть Джонни. Потому что он делает кино, которое заставляет думать, а не превращаться в жвачное животное в кинозале. Потому что он искренний и настоящий. Потому что он несет верные ценности. Потому что после его фильмов хочется жить, а не повеситься. Потому что он умеет быть собой и преодолевать самый жесткий формат.</p>
<p>Но я не могу понять ту часть аудитории, которая верит любому бреду из желтых СМИ и начинает заодно с системой топить Джонни. Как возможно получать от Джонни в подарок удовольствие и время своей жизни, наполненное счастьем, переживаниями, размышлениями – и вместо благодарности выдумывать и распространять весь тот негатив, который убивает его карьеру, наносит урон его репутации?</p>
<p>Дело дошло до того, что абсолютно всемирно известный и культовый Капитан Джек Воробей внезапно объявлен анахронизмом и вывалян в свином навозе. Впрочем как и сами понятия о добре, справедливости и чести. Зависло производство фильма с Гриндевальдом. Джонни постоянно грозят лишением ролей.</p>
<p>Но даже сейчас, когда от него хотят отказаться крупнейшие студии, Джонни не сдается и, обнажив шпагу в любой момент готов ринуться Кракену в пасть с громким кличем: «Ну что, Пугало!»</p>
<p>Глубинной причиной этого отвратительного изгнания Деппа из бизнеса, в частности такого бардака с ФТ и Пиратами, я считаю следующее. Его талант актера настолько мощный, что ему под силу не только отступления от жесткого смыслового формата в прочтении персонажей, но даже изменение на 180 градусов самой атмосферы фильма и идеи произведения. Не зря Диснеи еще до выхода первой части Пиратов носились по потолку с воплями ""Он убьет фильм!"", не зря Деппа называли отравой для бокс-офиса и при этом мучеником Голливуда, которого традиционно бросали в самые провальные проекты, с твердой уверенностью, что благодаря Джонни люди будут смотреть ЛЮБОЙ фильм. Потому что он безумно прекрасен. Невозможно оторваться от кадров с ним.</p>
<p>Но массового зрителя все равно этой свистопляской с лишением ролей не обмануть, люди уже знают, что Депп на экране - это то, на что очень стоит смотреть. Это как в музеях – перед объективно гениальными картинами всегда вытоптан пол. Независимо от силы и вектора пиара.</p>
<p>Теперь Джонни пошел ва-банк. Его просто загрызли и он закричал «Я хочу, чтобы люди узнали правду!!!» Это обращение просто к людям, как последняя надежда, этот крик о помощи… Даже если это был только пиар, господи, для меня это было намного легче и проще - знать, что ему не так плохо пришлось на самом деле, чтобы захотеть прийти куда-то с открытыми глазами, а уйти с закрытыми…</p>
<p>Есть мнения о том, что он выбирает громкий скандальный уход. И когда бывшая орет про тонущий Титаник, невольно вспоминается оркестр, игравший на палубе до конца.</p>
<p>Уже зная, как стойко Джонни все выносил до этого, я твердо уверена в том, что Джонни держится за жизнь зубами, и он не даст так просто закопать себя… Он будет отстаивать свое доброе имя и работать так долго, насколько это возможно… И да, он ждет поддержки своих поклонников. Ему очень нужна наша Любовь СЕЙЧАС.</p>
<p>Те, кто был на концертах Голливудских Вампиров, знают, как счастливо Джонни смотрит в зал, как он смеется и плачет от радости, как благодарно смотрит людям в глаза, ловит восторженные взгляды и маленькие подарки и цветы, что летят на сцену... И ты понимаешь, что ему очень нужна наша любовь, защита и поддержка. И это не только его моральное удовлетворение. Это его будущие контракты, роли, возможность делать кино и писать музыку, выступать с концертами.</p>
<p>Его защищают честные и легендарные коллеги-артисты, и даже для не особо посвященных в подробности его личной жизни, на мой взгляд, это достаточное основание для того, чтобы любить и поддерживать Джонни FOREVER.</p>
<p>Джонни УЖЕ сделал для нас больше, чем ВСЁ, он уже заработал нашу Любовь. Вечность. Место в истории. Он создал непреходящее. Фильмы и роли на любой вкус. Несколько любимых персонажей есть у каждого поклонника точно. Иногда с выбором определиться очень трудно, ибо любишь больше половины его персонажей как родных. Просто знакомьте с его фильмами тех, кто еще не знает об этом волшебстве, расскажите хотя бы немного о нем детям, и они научатся видеть и любить прекрасное, они сумеют отличить добро от зла , а дети их детей пронесут эту любовь дальше, в будущие века… Создавайте эту цепочку, которая тянулась к нам от сотворения мира и которая будет продолжаться после нас…. Джонни заслужил в ней свое Звено Бессмертия.</p>
<p>Друзья, все кого я люблю… люди, кого я даже ненавижу, но все равно люблю... Я вас умоляю со слезами на глазах и стоя на коленях. Пожалуйста… Будьте милосердны. Любите Джонни сейчас, и всегда. Включите немного Сторге и Филии, даже когда огонь вашего Эроса превратится в угольки.</p>","{'id': '223480969', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/7/zh/ig/GjzHIGijUJUPqCJ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1585922479', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

<p>По моей одноименной статье, опубликованной в Живом журнале <a href=""https://esfe-1.livejournal.com/10237.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://esfe-1.livejournal.com/10237.html</a><br>...Я занималась наукой, однако мне воспрепятствовали в этом. Нами были разработаны эффективные противовирусные препараты, обладающие, в том числе, противоопухолевым действием, за ними прямо дрались, когда разрешили временную продажу. Нам случайно удалось сделать открытие, которое все перевернуло. Директор единственного в мире профильного центра по гриппу - НИИ гриппа, Санкт-Петербург, где я работала, потребовал ""завалить"" этими препаратами всю аптеку нашего учреждения.</p>
<p>Но препараты еще не были разрешены для использования, к тому же в погоне за деньгами он требовал производить их в условиях аптеки, в неприспособленных для этого помещениях. Я отказалась. Тогда он сам «нарисовал» состав препаратов, и в первой строке поисковиков Интернета указал, что это наши препараты, только «усовершенствованные». У детей были осложнения после использования сильнодействующих и нигде не проверенных лекарств, против чего я выступила. Для меня клятва «Не навреди», которую я давала, не была пустым звуком, я всегда старалась следовать ей. Тогда директор меня уволил, подделав соглашение о расторжении трудового договора.</p>
<p>После того, как меня выбросили на улицу, прошли годы. Наши больные, которые жили благодаря использованию наших препаратов, поумирали. Я оказалась без гроша, и едва сводила концы с концами. Обращалась в суды, прокуратуру и т.п., но все было бесполезно. Суды и остальные правоохранители работают только на тех, кто им платит, занимаются фальсификацией документов и не особенно это скрывают. При этом никто с работы даже не поинтересовался, ела я сегодня что-нибудь или нет, удается мне хоть как-то выжить или нет, никто не протянул руку помощи, от таких все отворачиваются. Это можно назвать скорбным бесчувствием…</p>
<p>У меня были попытки куда-то устроиться на работу или получить грант, но все упиралось в НИИ, где я работала, куда звонили, а им отвечали, что я якобы устроила скандал при увольнении (свое преступление они называют скандалом), и везде я получала отказ. Я во всякие организации обращалась, но мои обращения спускали вниз, и они попадали в руки мошенников, которые меня выгнали, и тех, кто их крышует. Меня чуть ли не пол России знает, и ничего сделать нельзя. Все защитные механизмы пробуксовывают. Смириться с такой ситуацией невозможно.</p>
<p>Если говорить честно, сейчас мы оказались на краю бездны, что у нас не очень афишируется. Один из самых страшных вирусов - вирус гриппа - в последнее время резко наращивает свою агрессивность, а бороться с ним нечем. Вирус, вызвавший последнюю эпидемию - это та же «испанка», только несколько измененная, унесшая приблизительно от 50 до 100 миллионов жизней в начале прошлого века.</p>
<p>Ученые предсказывают, что может появиться вирус, вызывающий 100% летальность, он необычайно быстро мутирует. А препаратов широкого спектра действия, которые мы создавали и на случай смертельного гриппа, у нас нет. НИИ отчитался в Минздраве, что в институте нет специалистов моего уровня, чтобы продолжить эту работу. А я якобы не захотела ее продолжать и ушла, видимо, найдя более высокооплачиваемое место. Минздрав в свою очередь перекрыл мне все пути в науку и в подведомственные ему учреждения, даже если там не хватает докторов медицинских наук вирусологического профиля.</p>
<p>Когда все это почувствуешь на себе, начинаешь чувствовать боль и других людей. Борясь за себя, я стала отстаивать и права других, фактически превратилась в правозащитника. Стала членом международной организации Avaaz, активистом, которая занимается организацией социально-политических кампаний по широкому кругу вопросов, в частности, правами человека. Она имеет большие успехи. Также я сотрудничаю с Change.org – интернет-платформой по сбору подписей под петициями людей из разных стран, если это поможет кого-то или что-то спасти, вытащить из отчаянной ситуации.</p>
<p>Что касается американского актера, режиссера, музыканта, композитора Джонни Деппа (полное имя John Christopher Depp II), то он является одним из моих «подзащитных» и очень необычным человеком. Его ситуация во многом напоминает мою в том плане, что он тоже является жертвой мошенников. Узнав об этом, я опубликовала в своем блоге Живого журнала, посвященном борьбе за восстановление справедливости в отношении себя, статью и за справедливость в отношении ДД, указав адреса петиций, которые сейчас распространяются по всему миру с призывом помочь этому человеку. Его отстраняют от работы, не дают сниматься в фильмах, в которых он начал сниматься, его карьера под угрозой.</p>
<p>Того сопротивления, которое встретила, я даже не ожидала. На меня, а заодно и на Джонни Деппа, обрушился бешеный шквал злобы, ненависти, клеветы и всякого другого негатива - вы такая растакая, а он еще хуже. Поначалу я даже немного испугалась. Спасали друзья) Нападение удалось приостановить. Я же никогда не отступаю от своих принципов. И борьба продолжается...</p>
<p>Сбором подписей под петициями я занимаюсь не только через ВК, но и через другие соцсети, почту, ЖЖ и т.п. СМИ, желтая пресса, выступающие против ДД, необычайно сильны. Поэтому чем больше информации в его пользу, тем лучше. Я много пишу, помещаю много фото, чтобы заинтересовать и привлечь как можно больше потенциальных подписчиков, потому что от этого зависит жизнь человека, его здоровье, его карьера. С голоду он, скорее всего, не умрет, если все пойдет по худшему варианту (не дай Бог!), пойдет продавать ручки и другие ненужные вещи, как он говорит, чем он занимался до кино, но ведь он актер от Бога, считается лучшим актером современности.</p>
<p>У Джонни Деппа очень своеобразный характер. В детстве с ним никто не хотел дружить. Чтобы как-то его поддержать, мама купила ему дешевенькую гитару, о которой он мечтал и с которой не расстается всю жизнь. Он был так увлечен гитарой, что не заметил, как из ребенка превратился в мужчину, но до сих пор не повзрослел окончательно... Девочки совершенно не давали ему прохода. Очень застенчивый, стеснительный и скрытный, Джонни не мог сойтись с ребятами, которые называли его «дип» - тронутый, переиначив его фамилию, издевались над ним. В его жизни были и алкоголь, и наркотики…</p>
<p>Вытащил его из этого омута актер Николас Кейдж, с которым Джонни случайно познакомился. Кейдж сказал Джонни, - тебе терять нечего - иди в актеры! В Голливуде из него хотели сделать красивую куклу, но не получилось. Марлон Брандо о Деппе: «…прежде всего, он чрезвычайно интеллектуален. Он почти совершенен». Депп выработал правила жизни, основное – это руководствоваться только своими принципами, невзирая ни на какие влияния извне, и играл свои роли так, как хотел сам. Его не выгнали из-за колоссальных доходов, которые приносили фильмы с его участием, к нему была приставлена охрана…</p>
<p>У Джонни Деппа есть проблемы. Одна из них - со зрением. Он не скрывает, что одним глазом он не видит, а другим видит не дальше вытянутой руки. Его выручают очки, но если его герой их не носит, для ДД это пытка. Много раз падал на съемках фильмов, получая, в том числе, серьезные травмы. Чтобы не было ухудшения зрения, ему нельзя постоянно находиться в состоянии стресса, а он находится постоянно, годы, вынося потоки незаслуженной злобы, клеветы в свой адрес. Он очень скрытный, и все переносит в одиночку. Дай Бог, чтобы это не повредило его здоровью, как это было со мной.</p>
<p>К тому же пресловутая застенчивость Джонни Деппа делает его совершенно беззащитным. Он застенчив до такой степени, что, как он говорит: ""Если меня попросят встать и сказать тост на празднике... Для меня это будет катастрофа!». «Находясь в образе, могу сделать что угодно, сколько бы людей на меня ни смотрело». Он даже отказался от «Оскара», потому что за годы актерской карьеры он так и не смог избавиться от природной стеснительности и все так же робеет на публике. Застенчивому Джонни, видимо, даже в страшном сне не могло присниться, что он станет суперзвездой Голливуда. Ему нравится оставаться в стороне, он чувствует себя лучше «в тени». Из тени его, конечно, вытащили, и на суде он молча выслушал все, что на него выливали, не сказал ни единого слова в свою защиту. А ведь на него вешают уголовные статьи, причем, очень активно. Обвиняют в том, чего он не совершал. Его недруги вовсю пользуются этой особенностью его характера. Сейчас он, наконец, решился написать декларацию в свою защиту, у меня есть ее копия, как и копии всех его документов. Посмотрим.</p>
<p>Стоит немного остановиться на документах по делу Деппа. Протокол допроса выглядит таким образом: на каждой странице ровно по 25 строчек, каждая имеет свой номер, страницы пронумерованы. Я сравнила с моими документами из следственного комитета: ни номеров строчек, ни номеров страниц, о чем там написано, с первого раза не понять, да и с другого тоже... Когда в зале суда под внезапным порывом ветра распахнулось окно, и страницы в раскрытой папке зашевелились, готовые взлететь, весь суд с необычайным проворством бросился хватать их и укладывать на место. И это происходило не где-то в африканской глубинке, а в культурной столице России...</p>
<p>Я списалась с JT Larson (Джинни Депп), автором петиции из Штатов, и ее друзьями. Петиция направлена против Эмбер Херд, которая вместе со своими сторонниками в буквальном смысле слова издевается над этим беззащитным человеком. Я стала действовать совместно с ними. Американцы мне почему-то всегда казались какими-то бесчувственными. Но это оказалось не так. Наоборот, и Джонни Депп, и его американские друзья, и поклонники его творчества - очень добрые и душевные, отзывчивые люди, что я очень хорошо почувствовала.</p>
<p>Говорят, с кем поведешься… Джонни Депп просто заражает всех своей необычайной добротой и душевностью. Спрашивают, почему он так изумительно красив, никто не идет в сравнение с ним. Да просто потому, что он настоящий. По-моему, самое точное определение Джонни Деппу дала Марина Кардозо в своей статье LOVE JOHNNY ЛЮБИТЕ ДЖОННИ, которую я опубликовала с разрешения автора в своем блоге Живого журнала <a href=""https://esfe-1.livejournal.com/9580.html:"" rel=""nofollow"">https://esfe-1.livejournal.com/9580.html:</a> «Кто я вам? Ты – Сокровище!!!»</p>
<p>Потому, что он относится к людям с редкой добротой и благожелательностью, это все чувствуют. Даря доброту нуждающимся в ней, он окрыляет людей, которые, возможно, давно забыли о добром отношении к себе. И это делает счастливыми не только их, но и Деппа. Полагаю, что секрет редкой красоты Деппа заключается в его внутренней красоте. Очень хорошо об этом сказал Виктор Гюго: «Никакая внешняя прелесть не может быть полной, если она не оживлена внутренней красотой. Красота души разливается подобно таинственному свету по телесной красоте» - это о нем...</p>
<p>Сам Джонни Депп никогда не считал себя неотразимым. ""Более того, я никогда не думал, что я красавец"". Однако в рейтинге самых красивых мужчин мира за всю историю он занимал второе место после Пола Ньмана, ушедшего из жизни в 2008 г. Так что Джонни Депп оказался фактически на первом месте вместе со своей красотой и врожденной застенчивостью, а также робостью перед публикой), что его, по всей видимости, не особенно радует, а фотосессии он сравнил с насилием... Все это еще больше привлекает внимание публики к его застенчивой персоне, чего он так не любит, но вынужден мириться с этим))</p>
<p>Об аудитории Джонни Деппа очень хорошо сказано в упомянутой выше статье LOVE JOHNNY ЛЮБИТЕ ДЖОННИ: «Аудитория Джонни имеет большой процент людей искусства - немного странных, но умеющих делать необычное, и чуть-чуть похожих на него. А её огромный размах по возрасту, национальной принадлежности, политическим и религиозным убеждениям, сексуальным ориентациям и культурным предпочтениям просто поразителен. Его любят мужчины и женщины, люди старших возрастов и дети, богатые и бедные, элита и маргиналы, с хорошим образованием и без, представители ЛГБТ и традиционных культур».</p>
<p>Джонни Депп гордится тем, что в его роду были коренные жители Америки: ""В моем дедушке была кровь (индейского) племени чероки, а прабабушка имела отношение к племени крик». В жилах Деппа течет также немецкая и ирландская кровь. Однако Депп также связан и с Россией - он любит ее и россиян, его любимый писатель - Ф.Достоевский, один из любимых поэтов - В.Маяковский. Джонни Депп - настоящий ""книжный червь"". Актер признается, что может одновременно перечитывать 4-5 книг. Джонни снялся в 15 экранизациях литературных произведений, очень часто в кино Депп играет писателей, журналистов или поэтов.</p>
<p>Сотрудница музея Маяковского Екатерина Мартон написал в инстаграме о Джонни Деппе, который, прилетев в Москву 27.05.2018, чуть не с самолета приехал в этот музей: «Ущипните меня. Он только сегодня прилетел в Москву и одним из первых мест, куда он поехал это Музей Маяковского!!! Безумно добрый, тактичный, воспитанный, умный и самое главное совсем не пафосный». В «Квартире на Большой Пресне» актер провел два часа, а на следующий день у него был концерт...</p>
<p>Анжелина Джоли так высказалась о Джонни: ""Депп - один из тех артистов, которые воспринимают мир так, как будто они из другого времени. Он – совершенно потрясающий художник... Он во многом человек эпохи Возрождения..."" В статье LOVE JOHNNY ЛЮБИТЕ ДЖОННИ Марина Кардозо пишет о Джонни: ""Он - мечта миллионов, которая принадлежит всем. И никто не имеет права присвоить его только себе… Личная трагедия или великое счастье? Согревать весь мир – и мёрзнуть самому… Гений Джонни универсален и абсолютен, как Моцарт, Вивальди и Микеланджело, как Станиславский, Чехов и Шекспир, Чарли Чаплин и Маяковский, Майкл Джексон и Миядзаки... Его достижения принесли ему не только бешеную популярность, славу, обожание, поклонение - но и их ужасную обратную сторону - зависть, ненависть, травлю - просто потому что он Лучше"".</p>
<p>Скорбное бесчувствие коснулось и Джонни Деппа, когда на него обрушился весь этот ужас. Это отметила и JT Larson, автор петиции – не очень рвутся подписывать петиции в его защиту, не смотря на то, что это делается очень просто – надо нажать всего 2 - 3 кнопки на компьютере. В данном случае он сам никогда бы не остался в стороне. Но факт остается фактом - поднять общественность очень непросто, даже имея опыт. </p>
<p>Сам Джонни глубоко благодарен за любую поддержку в трудный период его жизни. И летят, и летят ко мне лайки и теплые слова благодарности из далекой Америки, от чего я давно отвыкла среди своих невзгод… В такое я бы никогда раньше не поверила - что в трудную минуту именно Америка поддержит меня, а Россия отвернется…</p>
<p>Мне остается только борьба за себя и за тех, кто оказался на краю пропасти… Как говорит Джонни Депп - ""Во многом виновата власть. И в остальном тоже"". Буду очень благодарна и признательна, если вы подпишете петицию и в мою защиту. Ее адрес:   <a href=""http://chng.it/LqhqQcK9Wf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chng.it/LqhqQcK9Wf</a> </p>
<p>В заключение приведу запомнившуюся мне запись JulieAndr6 в твиттере к недавно прошедшему Дню рождения Джонни: ""Ангел пришел в этот мир и сделал его лучше. Исключительный человек, с чистейшим и самым большим сердцем, и одаренный таким талантом…». Так не допустим, чтобы погиб ангел, который случайно или неслучайно залетел в наш мир… Ведь поклонников его творчества миллионы по всему миру, поэтому победа будет за ними.</p>
<p>Марина Кардозо в своей в своей честной и откровенной статье ""Любите Джонни"" пишет: ""Друзья, все кого я люблю… люди, кого я даже ненавижу, но все равно люблю... Я вас умоляю со слезами на глазах и стоя на коленях. Пожалуйста… Будьте милосердны. Любите Джонни сейчас, и всегда"".</p>","{'id': '223474786', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/0/pu/xk/YopUXKPzpQYVEnS-800x450-noPad.jpg?1585861029', 'processing': False}}",,,the-governors-of-the-states-california-texas-virginia-and-to-johnny-depp-usa-save-the-life-of-johnny-depp-and-his-career,,against

<p>Несмотря на то, что судебные слушания по делу Депп vs. The Sun отложены из-за эпидемии коронавируса, Депп получил хорошие новости относительно его иска против бывшей жены Эмбер Херд — суд отклонил протест Херд, а значит разбирательство по делу Депп vs. Херд состоится в любом случае.</p>
<p>«Возражение ответчика не идет вразрез с четвертым пунктом, но остальные три пункта предполагают отклонение протеста ответчика, - заявил судья Брюс Уайт в обращение к адвокатам обеих сторон. - Ко всему прочему, протест защиты относительно сроков давности также отклонен"".</p>
<p>На август этого года запланировано слушание по иску, поданному Джонни Деппом против своей бывшей жены. Актер подал иск в суд Вирджинии после того, как Херд дала интервью газете Washington Post, где обвинила Деппа (не называя его имени) в домашнем насилии.</p>
<p>Адвокат Херд Роберта Каплан отреагировала на новость об отклонении возражения судом:</p>
<p>«Что имела в виду мисс Херд в своем интервью, и правда ли это, решат присяжные. Как мы уже говорили, у судов есть мощные механизмы, которые помогут раскрыть правду. Мы уверены, что мисс Херд одержит победу, когда присяжные увидят все наши доказательства».</p>
<p>Адам Вальдман ответил на заявление Каплан:</p>
<p>«Сегодняшнее решение суда говорит само за себя. Так же, как и заявление Роберты Каплан. Мы вместе со здравым смыслом с нетерпением ждем момента, когда сможем увидеть «мифические» доказательства Эмбер Херд в суде. Мистер Депп потратил годы на поиски правосудия».</p>

8,StarterPetitionUpdate,30554650,2022-05-15T20:21:41.000Z,,Let’s keep it going!!,"<p>The trial is set to start up again tomorrow and Amber will again be telling her lies on the stand in her highly exaggerated and theatrical manner. It is the same woman who colluded with the ACLU and the Washington Post to create the fabricated story that ruined Johnny Depp’s reputation and career. Though being charged with domestic violence in a previous relationship, which was a woman, Amber was extended the role of Ambassador for Women’s Rights. This purpose of this petition is to communicate to the ACLU that Amber Heard should not be an ambassador of women’s rights specific to domestic violence, when she herself was previously charged with such against another woman. Additionally, the trial has brought to light even more abuses against her former husband and people who worked for her. Please share this along with me. </p>",,,,remove-amber-heard-as-aclu-ambassador-of-women-s-rights,,against

<p>Thank you to everyone who show public support for Disney to do better and for Warner Bros to get rid of their bad actors (President Toby Emmerich and Executive Walter Hamada).

We've lost two genius characters from Johnny's career history. Compared to Heard who wasn't even fired from Aquaman 2. This is very unfair on the part of the London court.

Johnny is innocent and we want justice for him!</p>","{'id': '224828235', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/kg/tk/fCKgtKXOJgBFhKI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1604782588', 'processing': False}}",,,the-royal-courts-of-justice-london-justice-for-johnny-depp,,against

<p>Here's Amber Heard's reaction to the audio of her admitting that she repeatedly abused Johnny Depp. Through her lawyer, she says:</p>
<p>""The fact that a woman fights or talks back does not mean that she has not been the subject of repeated domestic violence or abuse. It's a myth to say, as Mr. Depp apparently is implying that, if Ms. Heard slapped him, then she can't also be a victim. That is just not true.""</p>
<p>The argument that he was violent too might fly, except that the whole crux of her argument on the recording, the reason for the fight de jour, is that he always leaves (""splits"") whenever she starts a physical altercation with him. </p>
<p>Can't have it both ways, hon. You can't accuse him of abuse, but get caught on tape calling him a baby and a coward for leaving whenever you get physically violent with him. </p>
<p>This reaction doesn't fly any more than the rest of her flimsy accusations. Time's up for Amber, and she's apparent'y the only one that doesn't know it, still trying desperately to seem socially relevant. </p>

<p>""Internet Journalists"" were used by both Waldman and Barresi. They learned from each other on how to harm Amber Heard.<br>Waldman admitted he had no previous clients involved with domestic violence. The longstanding tradition of harming women and victims with ""Fixers"" was increased during this to be both <a href=""https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">online</a> and in-person.</p>
<p>We showed earlier that we have evidence of online operations harming Amber with persuasive science that we gave to Reporters.</p>
<p>The online issues are in essence extortion and illegal intimidation, saying to her since the ""Amber Heard's 2020 Takeaway: <a href=""https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/Adapt%20and%20Survive%20Amber%20Heard%20-%20YouTube%20Video"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Adapt and Survive</a>"" video in 2020 where she won in that case then saw 43K bot texts 'not a victim' then tens of thousands more switching texts, that she must recant or be destroyed/killed for it.<br>We wanted CSOs to look into it months before the trial. During her trial, it was 3-10x worse in metrics than any other previous time. Supposedly, a juror went onto one of the social media sites afterwards.</p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lgNL2l9N45ZTb5wupeSiW6lbxhoVzSP/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">In our report of the Judge</a>, we state:<br><em>""The misconduct, neglect, and suppression [by the Judge and Court] that increased danger led to thousands of death threats increasingly reaching Amber Heard and her witnesses during the trial as in testimony. </em></p>
<p><em>In-person, witnesses became threatened and tampered with before testifying on both sides of the trial. E.g., Jennifer Howell had her door drilled in and a witness of the Viper Room Richard Albertini was given death threats by a Hollywood Fixer... </em><em>[This witness is listed as the leading first source by Richard Schwartz as witnessing a cigarette put out on a woman similar to Amber's fears in the recording]</em></p>
<p><em>It is rational to conclude that jurors could have been afraid to provide a positive verdict for Amber Heard due to the dangers discussed during the trial that persist no matter the outcomes and lack of protections. Multiple attacks on the UK Judge from the 2020 verdict persisted after he stated that Amber Heard had been abused with a verdict helping her survival.</em><br><em>The jurors could have been hunted as were the witnesses and defendant. Although Amber Heard requested protections of the juror’s identities, it is clear that many attending in the court room could have identified the jurors.""<br></em></p>
<p>Although Empire Media Group has 12+ publications and 'new' not previously approved witnesses were brought into the end of the trial, this from her past friends, tracked by the Fixer and not referred to support Amber, only appeared in 1 site.</p>
<p>""Now working for an Austin-based security company, [Joshua] Cruz told Hollywood [Fixer] Paul Barresi: <a href=""https://radaronline.com/p/amber-heard-johnny-depp-trial-friends-dispute-borderline-personality-disorder/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">“Amber was always a sweet, considerate and lovely, little girl growing up and she's never changed. I've never known Amber to have ever caused a moment of sorrow for anyone.”</a> “Honestly, I don't believe she ever really knew, as we were growing up, how beautiful she was.” - Joshua Cruz, who has known Heard since childhood.</p>
<p>We have the <strong>email that Barresi sent Waldman on April 18</strong> to shut down Richard Albertini (first witness of Viper Room). There are <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/AmberHeardIT/status/1537412652464578562"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">3 cooperating witnesses so far (Video testimony)</a> to Barresi tampering, threatening, bribing, misleading, and possibly a 4th witness if cooperating. Albertini texted on May 19th (during the trial) that he would have testified for Amber's behalf.</p>
<p>2nd, Barresi emailed Elon Musk's lawyer on May 13 to remove this witness knowing of violence, crime, and tampering from social media, and disturbingly referred to murdered Amie Harwick who was referred to Barresi and Wayne Ketaily when she had cyber-stalking.<br>Neither Amber Heard's nor Amie Harwick's deaths after cyber-stalking are being stopped.<br><br><em>***Update:</em> We have Audio files from 2019 of Adam Waldman in negotiations with (originally Team Amber) witness Albertini and Albertini's lawyer of how to harm Amber Heard in the media by using Fixer Barresi, and of pay offs both for the media articles and after the trial. The payoffs after trial explains why Barresi and others became so bloodthirsty, intimidating, and tampering during Amber's trial.<br>Waldman states Depp is 'perfectly safe' with his Security. Sadly, this wasn't obtained by Amber's lawyers for the case.</p>
<p>Right now, many pages of Amber showing her good work are being deleted. It's heartbreaking and wrong. Criminal investigations should have been started a year ago, but were thwarted. It only increased in the intimidation and harms...<br><br><strong>The positive impact Amber has done for the world</strong> - we showed Reporters her <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20120118112943/http://amberheardofficial.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">AmberHeardOfficial.com</a> site showing her causes and activism which she deleted at the beginning of the relationship in 2012 - will always continue.</p>
<p>Remember that.<br><br><strong>We now have the in-person evidence, but as said as before, <em>it's crucial for you to support her</em> as Amber Heard has many insider threats around her.</strong><br><br><strong>Thank you to everyone who have returned to sign this petition.

<p><em><strong>Amber Heard is getting ready for Aquaman 2! ~ but also for the history books ~ </strong></em><strong>Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in this scene is supposed to be saying, ""I Cannot Stand By While Women's Lives Are Lost"" while saving Mera's life.</strong> </p>

<p>Maybe if you're a history buff, you can guess why it's double sided how Lobbyist Adam Waldman used <em>""Winston Churchill"" (the Prime Minister of Britain during World War II and against the Nazis)</em> when *someone* used it for symbolism as a quote for Robart Lio's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEAomcLuClCPT-HRB-KBu_w"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Aquaman Bots channel</a> that exposed how easy it is to create traffic bots to sign petitions (using different country IPs) and on a 2nd twitter account as 'Ralph White.'   <br><em>The quote is: ""You can always count on Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.""</em></p>
<p>This is especially true when it comes to cyber abuse online. Upon that, Amber Heard won in the United Kingdom which is ahead on coercive control laws to help women, 999, and safety tech. <em><strong>Cherie Blair (ex prime minister Tony Blair's wife) and Jennifer Robinson (Julian Assange's lawyer of 10 years. Waldman met with him 7 times before he was targeted on election interference and not long after we saw him detained) support Amber Heard.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Zack Synder had Mera use a British accent in his Justice League.</strong></em></p>
<p>No Hate Campaign - yes, we wish it was progressive to remove hate online that threatens lives and the progress that removed it elsewhere.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tens of Thousands of New Accounts</strong></em> (just the ones tweeting, not the ones just liking, either, because saw some of those messing up Natural Language Understanding) target Amber Heard in preliminary social network analysis from 2019-2021. It's over 35,000 new accounts. 134,000 tweets from new accounts made in the same year of 2020 targeting Amber in 2020. This doesn't include youtube or instagram, either.<br>Around 100 a day and peaks of 240 a day of new accounts were made in 2020 and show in targeted analysis around Amber. </p>
<p><strong><em>According to ""The Price of Influence: Disinformation in the Private Sector""</em></strong><br>They had a ""layered approach to propagating<br>material throughout social media. First, a group of older accounts<br>— referred to as “aged accounts” — that posted links to the articles<br>they had published in media sources was employed. Then, a new<br>batch of accounts that reposted content from the aforementioned<br>aged accounts to amplify the messages was used..."" <a href=""https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf</a><br>This is clearly seen in Amber's case.</p>
<p>What's worse, is the linked whistleblower at Facebook earlier - Sophie Zhang - shows that over 9,000 accounts were used in Azerbaijan to attack human rights activists, journalists, and '<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157720306386"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">rebels</a>.' She said they 'did it badly.' Yes, they did. These Social Campaign bots are far more difficult, voluminous, and skilled, to attack <strong><em>a single individual linked to human rights, women's rights, and the United Nations</em></strong>. <em>(The United Nations, of which Sir Churchill supported). 35,000 plus is far greater than that disinformation campaign that Zhang caused a Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Researcher to eventually investigate at FB.</em></p>

<p>Waldman bragged after he was Suspended from Twitter around April 20 that Depp had the ""fastest to 1 million followers in the HISTORY of Instagram."" If mentioned earlier, I swear I saw 'fake jack sparrow' as an example for content review agents training AI/ML signals back in 2019 (of course, always 1 year ahead of the elections). </p>
<p><em><strong>We see that Amber's case centers around Twitter as she's said. In fact, Twitter removed social sharing signals in 2015, a year before the 2016 elections.</strong></em> Webscraping Twitter showed that on election night, Trump was being named 4-5 times more than Hillary Clinton. But Social Bots have still not been linked to or reported on any of this.<br>Facebook still has social sharing signals showing, and the petitions are hardly shared there.</p>
<p>The large fake one attacking Amber Heard in Aquaman 2 has around 22,000 shared links on FB. The Cloud words for Twitter center around @Change.</p>
<p>The Social Network Analysis of over 940,000 tweets between 2019-2021 actually focuses on destroying Amber, not 'pro-depp' first in reality. </p>
<p>Waldman represented both organized crime accused Oligarch Oleg Deripaska and Christopher Steele's Dossier. By attacking and trying to destroy or kill Amber Heard, they're essentially making it obvious that this was double dealing. <br>Unfortunately, Depp is obsessed with Amber. If you notice, she's the ""most beautiful woman according to a scientific algorithm"" - I also know what that does with my own mother. The male ex partners never let go of these women. The more glamourous they imagine the woman they abuse to be, the worse it is for the abusive man's obsessions with her.</p>

<p>Among the death threats and social bots online - as tech is a part of this 21st Century story - Waldman refers to homeland security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.'</p>
<p>In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a ""007 Flemming's novel"" to an artificial intelligence auditor? </strong></p>
<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. They terrified dozens of actresses.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, intense real-time monitoring occurs for Amber Heard online using AI Bots which claim using ""I am"" Persona Dialogue - open source between 2017 and 2020 - to be 'victims' and use ILM/Alex fill in the blank based on previous text Dialogues which goes beyond a 2021 social network analysis paper using BERT: <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071</a></p>

<p>Witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed Depp's agents wanted to make lies about Amber Heard's trips to Tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.</p>
<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>The United Kingdom is where Amber won in the NGN trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.</strong></p>

<p>From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.</p>
<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore.</p>
<p>Right next door to this extreme wealth, are the slums of Los Angeles.</p>

Over 30,000 tweets/activities were on January 27th, days <em>before</em> the audio leaks beginning on January 31st in the Daily Mail newspaper and there were few targeted tweets before then in that month. There were over 50,000 on November 2nd, with heightened targeting when it was announced that she won by Judge Nicol in the UK. Ironically, timed with the USA's elections.</li>
<li>Over 9,000 accounts in Natural Language Understanding are seen against her in latest 50,000 tweets with 1,500 supporting accounts in a more specialized monitoring page process.</li>

<li>Recently, we saw two AI Bot accounts threatening Amber Heard with a dead heart profile and raw flesh banner, and Hunting Hound working, then a faceless profile working to boost as well (layered persona bots). If you recall, the trials in 2020 revealed that Depp put raw meat around the house and in Amber's gown. How does a moderator-type person who is 'not a bystander' sleep? It's like a smoking gun that we used to ask a Twitter Worker - finally reached after all of this time - for help, who said our studies were forwarded.</li>

It's tragic.</p>
<p>How does this affect Amber Heard? She's caught in the middle of this era and is a Cyber Civil Rights Spokesperson. SHEILD Act still has not passed.</p>

<p><strong>JANUARY 05, 2021 by Eriq Gardner - Amber's Countersuit goes forward, but misses the online part of social manipulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnny Depp Must Face Ex's Libel Suit After His Attorney Declared ""Hoax""</strong></p>
<p>A Virginia judge allows Amber Heard to partially proceed on counterclaims, although not the one that targeted her ex-husband for allegedly deploying bots against her.<br>Johnny Depp has failed to leverage a new law that he may be partially credited for bringing about. On Monday, a Virginia state court judge rejected the actor's bid for immunity over statements made about Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard. As a result, if the case moves to trial later this year, Depp will face counterclaims after his attorney told media outlets that Heard's tale of domestic abuse was a ""hoax.""...</p>
<p>Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was ""fake"" and all part of a ""sexual violence hoax,"" Heard included defamation counterclaims too...</p>
<p>Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims — a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit against a British tabloid. <strong>The November ruling that Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was ""substantially true""</strong> has wounded Depp's career...</p>
<p>The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.</p>
<p>But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the Daily Mail in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.)...</p>
<p>""In support of her accusation of malice, Ms. Heard alleged that the GQ journalist, Mr. Heath, stated that Mr. Depp invited him to interview the actor because he was 'angry —angry about a lot of things —and he's vengeful,'"" states the opinion. ""Moreover, Ms. Heard has alleged that Mr. Depp has the intention of ruining her career; citing statements that he made to friends demonstrating a malicious intent. Further, Mr. Depp has admitted his intent to destroy Ms. Heard's career by stating that he wanted her replaced on Aquaman. Accordingly, Ms. Heard has sufficiently pled a malicious intent, which prevents a ruling on the self-defense privilege at this stage in the litigation.""<br><br>From: <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax</a></p>

<p><strong>Photos, audios, texts, witnesses, and data proved Amber Heard is a victim of domestic abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber is a spokesperson for the ACLU, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, World Identity Network, and United Nations Gender Equality SDG5.</strong></p>
<p>Heard continues to make frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence that were attempting to make their voices heard during that pivotal moment in US history. In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women’s rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically). Amber has continued with trips to Central America where she met with human-rights defenders, diplomats, and indigenous community leaders.</p>
<p><em>She has spoken for, introduced and advocated for democratic candidate Kamala Harris since 2007 and has been very active in supporting Harris in her 2020 presidential run</em>. Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as “revenge porn”) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.</p>
<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.</p>
<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and free-thought in the increasingly polarized political world at Arizona State University for thousands of people attending.</p>

<p><em>The Times</em>: ""She has become a vocal campaigner on the issue of domestic and sexual abuse as an ambassador for <em><strong>women’s rights</strong></em> for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).""</p>
<p><em>The Sun</em>: ""On November 2, following a four-week trial, a judge ruled that the allegations against Depp, 57, were<strong> “substantially true” and that he was violent towards Amber.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Domestic violence charities have hailed the outcome a victory</strong></em> that will hopefully encourage other victims to speak out and seek justice.</p>
<p>Karen Ingala Smith, CEO of domestic violence charity Nia, praised Amber’s courage, saying: <strong>“I would like to acknowledge the bravery of Heard in naming the abuse that she was subjected to.”</strong>""</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hollywood Reporter, further, showed that Amber's ex, Depp, sent an abusive voicemail to his first wife, Lori, requiring a $1.25 million settlement in ""<a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion"" rel=""nofollow"">He's Radioactive</a>.""</li>

<p><em>Unfortunately, <strong>the online warfare to demean progress for women worldwide</strong> - people of my team know that female leaders in South America were removed because of online cyberabuse - continues.</em></p>
<p>Amber Heard may be in entertainment, but she's historically been highly political, highly an activist, and a humanitarian.</p>
<p>Contrary to former belief, the social technology companies are not liberal on the backend. Stereotypes abound against women and internationals in their training and actions, which is backed up by repeated people defying their NDA contracts. Pinterest's ex-COO recently won $22 million in a settlement about gender discrimination. The world is catching onto *environments* and *livability* online, as well as training, but meanwhile, we have to see people like Amber Heard struggle.</p>
<p>From real tests and studies, people will sign petitions, ""join in,"" and more <strong><em>even when they see bots signing</em></strong>. These leaders in tech do not go out and tell them that they're wrong. It's completely enabled, just like as part of the institutions Amber discussed in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Though Change.org shut down at least 4 abusive comment sections on petitions against Amber, deleted possibly two hate petitions, and the number of 253 in search related to her name has decreased to 241, <em>they still never put reCAPTCHA onto the large hate petition against her</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you can tell from the ratio of low amounts of comments, likes, and so on compared to 'signatures' that the petitions are usually increased to a set amount to gain attention via machine learning bot experts.</p>
<p>See this short video about the Bots Swarm the days just before Xmas! Happy 'holidays' or should I say, why should coders from reddit hate groups have more of a say than our own leaders?</p>
<p>By the way, it's online retaliation... Let's say maybe the internet differed during #MeToo. If it was different, though studies are as old as 2007, it's now fully controlled by 'men's rights' and other extremist groups. Anyone can hire them, but women in machine learning and AI is rare. In fact, it can just be 17% women in AI according to <a href=""https://action.consumerreports.org/coded_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">Coded Bias</a> documentary. </p>

<ul>
<li>In reality, anyone who rationalizes abuse against Amber Heard is statistically and scientifically wrong in thinking that they're not harming women's safety and progress by doing so. It's proven in *real life* such as the danger increasing in Turkey due to the rationalized domestic abuse against women that it harms equality.</li>

<p>“I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” a British judge wrote, dismissing the actor’s libel case on Monday...</p>
<p>Johnny Depp on Monday lost his court case against a British newspaper that called him a “wife beater” and claimed <strong>there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard repeatedly during their marriage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair</strong>, <a href=""https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case</a>, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was <strong>“substantially true.”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.</strong></em></p>
<p>The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said.</p>
<p>Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...</p>
<p>The article [from NGN] called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book.</p>
<p>The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....</p>
<p>After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, <em><strong>“Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, said the actress was “unable to comment on the case due to the ongoing U.S. proceedings.” But Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Ms. Heard’s American lawyer, said in a statement that <strong>the judgment was “not a surprise.”</strong></p>
<p>“We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s right to free speech,” Ms. Bredehoft said.""</p>

<p><strong>Unlike him, however, she was given a police escort because of threats from Depp’s fans...</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 12 out of the 14 incidents of assault reported by Heard in open court, the judge said he found the allegations proved on the balance of probabilities...</strong></p>
<p>More seriously – say sources close to Heard – both she and her sister Whitney have received anonymous death threats. Harassing messages were also sent to the chambers of Jennifer Robinson, the human rights lawyer whose clients include Julian Assange and who attended court with Heard, alongside Heard’s partner, Bianca Butti, and a US attorney, Elaine Bredehoft.</p>
<p>Other voices, while not aligned specifically with Heard, had spoken up outside of court, such as the Labour frontbench MP Jess Phillips, who voiced concern about what she had read in coverage “that seems to be a character assassination of Heard, leaning too far, in my opinion, towards the old tropes about domestic abuse that campaigners like me have tried for years to combat...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>This is a great day for Amber!! We're so happy to cheer for you from the sidelines!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>We hope to support Amber Heard possibly at her May 2021 Virginia, USA Trial!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Despite online discrimination and manipulation, it's essential that jurors see support of Amber instead of only hate mobs.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The online and technology sphere has not been equal and has been altered... </strong></p>
<p><strong>It's horrible to watch her as domestic abuse victim be legally validated and the attacks to continue online...</strong></p>
<p>We've seen probable insider people online such as ""Cle"" describing the over a dozen incidents of violence when no one else reported on it... as well as $100,000 given to a 'witness' for Depp... before they were suspended on Twitter...</p>
<p><em>As proven, the main social media platforms prefer to stay with the hierarchy, of well, ""FAKE jack sparrow"" case examples, such as at BC Forward AT Facebook... Content protections could be automated with victim-centering, not discriminatory, supporting women's quality of life, and have humanitarian volunteers... </em></p>
<p><strong>It's so sad that they enable harming women's lives online and stopping their leadership...</strong></p>
<p><em>It's tragically created online, but it doesn't have to be...</em></p>

<p><em>We actually work on public safety tech and safety tech projects in alliances, though not connected directly to this. When that anonymous source contacted online and then someone also continued to post with a different 'voice', it was during an internship planning about updating 911 and rescue systems with artificial intelligence, internet of things, real-time data, maps, machine learning and more, plus, also creating social media platforms... </em></p>
<p><em>Situations of having no witnesses was taken into account... </em></p>
<p><em>When it will ever be updated, is unknown... But we are helping other public safety tech partners.</em></p>
<p><strong>It's clear about technology and culture influencing this case. It's complex and won't be over unless society changes.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Not providing victims or the public with protective technology or data is about power... </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>As said, Amber was ahead of her time collecting data, especially as a woman when today, usually it's male dominated in technology, which shows also why we don't have technology for safety. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Many forces want to silence her activism.</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, the petitions on Change often have to be sponsored in order to be seen. Also... we gladly delete negative comments on this website where there is no reporting against enabling abuse against women. Defense is in our logo...</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p><strong>It's a Social Problem of Society</strong>. Blaming the woman for being murdered is exactly what we saw happening with the tabloids framing the audios against Amber Heard, and how they would literally cut out pieces that would have benefited her such as escalating to a ""crime scene"" and one of them being killed (would have been Amber losing her life), and her being kicked, kicked, kicked...</p>
<p>Blaming the woman for losing their life by the media (now social media too) is stated in 2013 dissertation sent to me.</p>
<p>""Intended to blame both partners equally for the violence, even when one had killed the other"" - We need to change this with social media. Social media can regulate news stories, also, yet, today's social media (not mentioned in the 2013 dissertation sent to me about domestic violence portrayed in the news media) is even worse, as it's 24/7 abuse. They don't even talk about 1 in 3 women being a victim of domestic violence. They'll focus on sexual assault, but not DV...</p>
<p>The tabloids (with social media) has been falsely framing and rationalizing escalations to a crime scene and Amber fearing for her life with social media amplifying hate 24/7.</p>
<p><em>""Domestic violence is also one of the leading causes of injury to women in the United States, with more than <strong>one in three women</strong> being a victim of domestic violence within their lifetime (National Criminal Justice Reference Service 2012).""</em></p>
<p>Are we ever going to empower and let people help by creating better systems?</p>

<p>Nov 16: <em><strong>This Support Petition for Amber was Hidden from Search for Change's database </strong>for possibly months now</em>. Search via Keywords on their platform has been restored after inquiries...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, read Zhang's whistleblower report of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of bots purchased to harm political adversaries.

<p>After Amber WON and validated by the judge, they've increased sign ups, which is nonsensical without media and legality being on her side. Signatures, reviews (including IMDb where they harassed female public figures in movies), likes, etc can all be purchased online... Women's Equality is political online, with figures like Melinda Gates getting 900+ dislikes to Hide From Search &amp; Hide from Recommendations with only 6K views.</p>
<p>We're also happy that Warner Bros executives are old enough to remember the world before social media, and will listen to the Legal Judgement that Amber is valid instead of complying with python-manipulated social media or paid tabloids for clicks.<br><br>On Nov 6, Warner Bros had Depp resign from his role.</p>
<p><strong>Amber is still in Aquaman 2, and we hope that by 2022, the internet will look different for her and others</strong>.</p>

<p>Read the article: <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives</strong></a></p>
<p>The 911 calls made for her, audios, recordings, and videos collected have been framed on the internet without any consideration of her life or the millions of other women worldwide who have no way to collect evidence. <em>It’s preventing awareness and change to save lives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard may be Mera in Aquaman, but she is not bulletproof to the escalating repetitive, digitalized, and long-term harms against her.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What people don’t know is that Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.</strong> <a href=""https://savemenowapp.es/en"" rel=""nofollow"">911 cannot even locate with data</a> to know where a caller is or use text information.</p>
<p>She did this before the European Innovation Council and Swedish government supported creating <a href=""https://brightact.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">a cell phone application</a> that was founded during COVID-19 to streamline services, reporting, and data-collecting for domestic abuse victims.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amber-heard-united-nations-sexual-violence-event_n_5d8d58c5e4b0019647a5ebef"" rel=""nofollow"">United Nations General Assembly</a> just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://powerphone.com/landmark-decision-will-change-911-domestic-violence-call-handling/"" rel=""nofollow"">Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced for 911 dispatchers</a> in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it.</strong> There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA. Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.</p>
<p>When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You <a href=""http://accessos.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location</a> from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.</p>
<p><strong>By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.</strong></p>
<p>When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Washington Post</a> in December 2018.</p>
<p>There’s a lawyer for her ex that writes threateningly online with cryptic words such as “in memorium” and a dark profile photo with no oversight telling him to stop his actions.</p>
<p><strong><em>There are double standards of no mercy towards Amber, who wanted positive change and to do humanitarian work.</em></strong></p>
<p>Most women will never make backups of their texts, or store years of photos and recordings, not until culture has changed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.</strong></em></p>
<p>The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with her ex-husband, losing confidence, and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>It’s reported that staff knew she was injured, including kicked on a private plane and seen on a private island being physically harmed after a fight. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said she would be killed off record, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.</strong></p>
<p>Multiple YouTube accounts and a hateful petition against her crowdfund donations and advertising dollars with objectifying comments based off inciting the already existing, and increasing for the past ten years, hate against women, against LGBT equality, and especially agendas against female public figures and their leadership. It’s <a href=""https://www.stophateforprofit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hate for Profit</a> - which created a boycott campaign this year against social media platforms doing nothing to stop it, yet the United States movement of 1,100 businesses, nonprofits, and civil rights groups did not mention hate against women or LGBT.</p>
<p>Organizations such as <a href=""https://hatelab.net/2020/05/04/hatelab-featured-in-the-guardian/"" rel=""nofollow"">HateLab</a>, <a href=""https://www.adl.org/blog/redirect-method-yields-valuable-insights-for-countering-online-extremism"" rel=""nofollow"">MoonshotCVE</a>, <a href=""http://stophateuk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">StopHateUK</a>, <a href=""https://www.ditchthelabel.org/report/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ditch the Label</a>, <a href=""https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map"" rel=""nofollow"">Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)</a>, <a href=""https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/cyber-violence-report-press-release"" rel=""nofollow"">United Nations Women</a>, <a href=""https://www.genderit.org/sites/default/files/flow_corporate_policies_formatted_final_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Association for Progressive Communications</a>, <a href=""https://www.adl.org/trollsharassment"" rel=""nofollow"">Anti-Defamation League</a>, and <a href=""https://plan-international.org/news/2020-10-05-abuse-and-harassment-driving-girls-facebook-instagram-and-twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">Plan International</a> have studies about extremism, hate, discrimination, and hostility increasing on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Tens of thousands of victims are in these studies with no actions done by power-holders to do prevention.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/misogyny-sites"" rel=""nofollow"">SPLC marked in 2012</a> that Men’s Rights Reddit was a hate group and that American female public figures were especially targeted.<em> The group still exists and boosted the hateful petition against Amber Heard. </em><strong>Terms online such as ‘simp’ are used to harass supporters of Amber and other men trying to help her which is connected to these anti-women ideologies.</strong> “Fathers for Justice” posted a billboard outside her UK trial while people harassed her, proving once again that extremism from the internet will filter into in-person threats.</p>
<p><em><strong>The social media platforms ignore violence against women online and prevent reporting harassment to help others.</strong></em> Requiring victims to report themselves is too overwhelming and doesn’t protect people, not only counting the biased content review training. Only 17% of leadership at social tech companies may be women, and coding is not being used to help them or victims. AI for Good and the United Nations state that data is trained to be gender biased.</p>
<p><strong>Amber supported SDG5 for gender equality at the UN Social Good Summit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When technology could be used to rescue, empower, or to help women, it’s instead being used to wield power over them.</strong></p>
<p><em>Numerous accounts supporting Amber Heard online have been suspended, deleted, harassed, and removed from the internet and even hacked</em>, such as AmberHeard Italia page, MelanieMakeup, and witnesses. Petitions, videos, or posts supporting her are hardly seen and are suppressed online since they are not encouraged by social tech companies, their algorithms are manipulated by negative repetition, and they are not sponsored, despite hard news journalists or documentarians seeing them.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 era increased harassment, cyberabuse against women and domestic violence with no way for them to receive any help from other people, situational support, economic aid, and certainly not from modern technology. Crowdsourced help doesn’t exist for domestic abuse victims in the USA. It shows how dire the situation is.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard collected more evidence than most women ever will, and she did it in a society that tells women to be helpless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to take actions against cyberabuse and to help people with technology.</strong></p>
<p>Help crowdsourcing, crowdsourced housing and services, proactive protections against harms online, and updating public safety systems based on technology for good are the solutions we need. We need to move not only to being victim-centered, but to being proactive to help others whether online or in-person.</p>
<p>We need to tell people to help others and that leadership based on creating positive social impact which can inspire others is wanted – not retaliated against.</p>
<p><em><strong>We’re inspired to continue to work on <a href=""http://savemenowapp.es/"" rel=""nofollow"">changes to public safety</a></strong>. </em></p>
<p>We need to open our eyes to the problems of and solutions to our culture.</p>
<p><strong>We should embrace leaders and inspiring people such as Amber Heard!</strong></p>
<p><strong>More people should be supporting her and letting her be heard. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to do more to improve and save lives.</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this week, Andrew Rossow, Senior Legal Editor at True Hollywood Talk and founder of the anti-cyberbullying movement, <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/345858"" rel=""nofollow"">#CYBERBYTE</a>, announced the launch of a Kickstarter in partnership with 13 Reasons Why and Supernatural actor, Mark Pellegrino, to help fund <a href=""https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Mark-Pellegrino-and-Internet-Attorney-Andrew-Rossow-Announce-THE-GUARDIAN-PROJECT-Reality-Docuseries-20201027"" rel=""nofollow"">The Guardian Project</a> – a multi-tiered attack on bullying which they hope to bring to the big screen as a docuseries.</p>
<p>In an interview with<a href=""https://www.influencive.com/Andrew-Rossow-Bullying-Activism-Pellegrino"" rel=""nofollow""> Influencive</a>, Pellegrino and Rossow shed some light on the future of The Guardian Project. The project, according to Pellegrino, “enables victims to confront victimizers and obtain some form of justice. Whether that justice is restitution in the form of material payback for the harm caused by spreading false narratives, or the reform of the victimizers, we seek to empower victims of social media slander, libel, and bullying by letting the victimizers know that anonymity will not protect them from the consequences of their actions.”</p>
<p>The problem, Rossow says, is that our own regulators don’t want to believe this is a real problem. “Forty-eight states have some form of electronic harassment law, but the criminal provisions aren’t strong enough to do anything, other than slap on the wrist. This needs to change.”</p>

<p><em><strong>Here is our summary:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Amber only wanted to move on with her life, such as to be Mera of Aquaman and to do humanitarian work for the United Nations, ACLU, refugees, World Identity Network SDG 16, Amnesty International, and causes for Human Rights. </strong></p>
<p>Amber Heard experienced choking, kicking, headbutting, over a dozen physically violent fights, bruising, pushing, abuse, loss of confidence, death threats, coercive control, and loss of physical health from Depp. She feared for her life. We show her side...</p>
<p>It's been nearly 7 years since the first violent experience, yet the abuse continues...</p>
<p>Crowdfunding and modern 21st century online manipulation is used against her, as if she's a political adversary of her ex-husband and his alliances.</p>

<p>Harassment is done by Depp's agents, paid tabloids, and online simulations.</p>
<p>Forces work against her, such as Adam Waldman who worked for Russian Oligarch Deripaska, to use social media against her while threatening reporters such as a New York Times one on 'national security', supporters, businesses like Warner Bros and L'Oreal, and witnesses.</p>
<p>Adam Waldman's Twitter account only follows the Dali Llama, and originally had no photo, then added a photo closer to the July 2020 UK NGN trial.</p>
<p>Swayed by false commentary and online tip jars, even reporter Nick Wallis removed evidence on Amber's side, such as <a href=""https://youtu.be/CunBOnfsDBE"" rel=""nofollow"">the recording included (13:33) of Divenere</a> telling Amber she was intimidated by Waldman with being deposed, $20,000 in lawyer fees, and leading questions to coerce her.</p>
<p>Messages are included from an anonymous source stating she was a partner of ex-staff in March 29 and April 2019, stating that Waldman and Depp's team wanted her done.</p>
<p>Staff knew Amber was injured repeatedly and were on NDAs.</p>

Nor does she need to worry about Depp's circle, criminals including 3-time felony 'minion' Ryan Leone who will do anything for Depp's attention or to incite his followers, or high profile individuals. Online simulations don't target Melissa with hate. Melissa's support comes after Amber's suffering.</p>

<li>Amber Heard did what she should have to protect herself with collecting evidence, especially with the numerous death threats that her ex gave her, and is still giving to her de facto through his followers or by coercing her through his media manipulation.</li>
<li>She did this before culture (or public affairs) caught up.</li>

<li>We won't ever 'rationalize' abuse or deaths of women.</li>

<p>Parts of the Counterclaim from Amber Heard against Cyberabuse refers specifically to Adam R. Waldman, licensed by the Washington DC bar and who previously worked for Oligarch Billionaire Deripaska, who was accused of organized crime and knowing about election interference.</p>
<p><strong>Counterclaim in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virgina: CL-2019-0002911 from Amber Laura Heard against John C. Depp II.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/473092071/cl-2019-2911-def-counterclaims-8-10-2020"" rel=""nofollow"">Counterclaim CL-2019-0002911</a>: </strong></p>
<p>""1.                  As part of his ongoing smear campaign, Mr. Depp and/or his agents acting on his behalf have directed both authentic and inauthentic social media accounts, and/or non-human controlled “bots,” to target Ms. Heard’s Twitter account and attempt to interfere with her contracts and/or business expectancies. In particular, many of these accounts both smear and harass Ms. Heard while simultaneously promoting and praising Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, Adam Waldman. The talking points in these accounts are strikingly similar but use slightly different text and content to evade Twitter’s anti-spam and platform manipulation guideline, which bars harassing, abusive, and intimidating behavior except “when viewed in the context of a larger conversation.” A herd mentality helps mask predatory behavior.<br>2.                  There are a number of newly created foreign language accounts specifically or predominantly designed to damage Ms. Heard. Many of these accounts have Cyrillic signatures, reflecting Russian origin. Mr. Waldman, Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, is publicly  associated with Russian individuals with the capability to organize such attacks.</p>
<p>3.                  Two accounts, IFOD NET and MY GRINDELWALD, are responsible for approximately 50% of the targeted attacks on Ms. Heard. The MYGRINDELWALD account uses its platform to amplify anti-Heard hashtags and false information being disseminated about Ms. Heard. It has also amplified the change.org petitions described above, repeating calls for  Ms. Heard to lose contracts or business expectancies. And, as evidence of its origin, it routinely tweets the statements of Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, Mr. Waldman, on a near-daily basis and often praises the otherwise unknown attorney, even going so far as to say “i love you waldman!!”</p>
<p>4.                  In total, there are at least dozens if not hundreds of inauthentic accounts that impugn Ms. Heard while praising Mr. Waldman. This messaging further evidences the origin of Mr. Depp’s unlawful campaign and demonstrates that these inauthentic accounts are actively coordinating content to manipulate the Twitter platform and avoid detection....</p>
<p>1.                   Mr. Depp, through his agents and attorneys in Virginia, including specifically Waldman, have engaged in a campaign to harass and damages Ms. Heard through the use of computers and computer accessible vehicles.</p>
<p> 1.                  This campaign of harassment is consistent with comments Mr. Depp made to friends regarding his intentions to ruin Ms. Heard’s career, or worse. For example, in 2013, Mr. Depp texted his friend, actor Paul Bettany, the following: “Let’s burn Amber.” The same day, he texted Bettany again with plans to murder her: “Let’s drown her before we bum  her!!! I will f-k her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.”</p>
<p>1.                  This conduct also has the potential effect of polluting  the jury  pool  who will decide the actual issues in dispute in this lawsuit.</p>
<p>2.                  Mr. Depp, through his agents and attorneys, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CunBOnfsDBE"" rel=""nofollow"">has also attempted to intimidate and threaten witnesses</a> to attempt to influence their testimony in a manner adverse to Ms. Heard, claiming that they will have to spend significant sums for attorneys if they do not cooperate and sign declarations prepared by Waldman, suggesting that without their cooperation people will be arrested and charged with crimes, and the like....</p>
<p>1.                  Depp’s defamation and harassment of Ms. Heard did not stop when he filed this lawsuit. In fact, it has continued though the present, as Depp has authorized and  conspired  with his attorney, Adam Waldman (acting on Depp’s behalf), to attempt to destroy and defame Ms. Heard in the press, accusing her of being a serial liar who created the abuse she endured from Depp, which is not true.</p>
<p>2.                  On April 12, 2019, Depp, through Waldman, accused Ms. Heard of committing “defamation, perjury and filing and receiving a fraudulent temporary restraining  order demand with the court” falsely accusing Ms. Heard of not being attacked by Depp. Exhibit B.</p>
<p>3.                   Depp, through Waldman, continued to defame Ms. Heard in June 2019, stating to Blast that “Ms. Heard continues to defraud her abused hoax victim Mr. Depp, the #metoo movement she masquerades as the leader of, and other real abuse victims worldwide.” Exhibit C.</p>
<p>1.                  On July 2, 2019, Depp, through Waldman, told Blast that Ms. Heard, “went to court with painted on ‘bruises’ to obtain a Temporary Restraining Order on May 27.” Exhibit D. The next day, Waldman continued Depp’s defamation of Ms. Heard when he stated to People magazine that “Ms. Heard’s ‘battered face’ was a hoax.” Exhibit E.</p>
<p>2.                  Depp, through Waldman, continued to claim that Ms. Heard was committing perjury to the Daily Mail, when he stated on April 8, 2020 that “Amber Heard and her friends in the media use fake sexual violence allegations as both a sword and shield, depending on their needs. They have selected some of her sexual violence hoax ‘facts’ as the sword, inflicting  them on the public and Mr. Depp.” Exhibit F.</p>
<p>3.                  Then on April 27, 2020, Depp, through Waldman, again told the Daily Mail that “Quite simply this was an ambush, a hoax. They set Mr. Depp up by calling the cops but the first attempt didn’t do the trick. The officers came to the penthouses, thoroughly searched and interviewed, and left after seeing no damage to face or property.  So Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911.” Exhibit G.</p>
<p>4.                  On June, 24, 2020, Depp, through Waldman, falsely accused Ms. Heard in the Daily Mail of committing an “abuse hoax” against Depp. Exhibit H.</p>
<p>5.                  On July 22, 2020, Depp, through Waldman, tweeted the following with a picture:</p>
<p>This photo was taken March 23, 2013 ONE DAY AFTER Ms. Heard alleges Johnny Depp backhanded her in the face with heavy rings on his fingers.</p>
<p>6.                   On July 26, 2020, Depp, through Waldman tweeted the following with the same pictures:</p>
<p>Nice Photo taken March 24, 2013 one day after she [Ms. Heard] claimed Johnny smashed her in the face with heavily ringed fingers. Confronted, Amber testified she sees swelling in the pie. Whitney then testified she sees swelling and a SPLIT LIP. Do you Believe[sic] them or your own lying eyes?</p>
<p>1.                  These tweets contained false and defamatory information, including the date of the picture.</p>
<p>2.                  This elaborate plan to defame Ms. Heard was willful and malicious.</p>
<p>3.                  Contrary to his allegations and efforts to rewrite history, Depp did in fact engage in acts of domestic violence and abuse against Ms. Heard, and Ms. Heard did not perjure herself, fabricate evidence, defraud, or create a hoax. Depp’s statements and allegations, both  through Depp and his agent Waldman (acting on Depp’s behalf), are false and defamatory.</p>
<p>4.                  In this Counterclaim, Ms. Heard seeks a judicial declaration that her op-ed is not actionable, is protected by Virginia’s Anti-SLAPP statute, Virginia Code § 8.01-233.2, and Ms. Heard is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to Virginia Code § 8.01-233.2.</p>
<p>5.                  Ms. Heard further seeks to restore the balance of truth and fight back, as the victim of domestic abuse and violence, and take a stand against this continuing and unrelenting  abuse. Ms. Heard seeks compensatory damages and punitive damages from Depp for his false and defamatory statements and for the harassment and abuse of computers and computer accessed media, as set forth in this Counterclaim.""</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/cyrillic-russian-spiders-from-mars/"" rel=""nofollow"">According to reporter Joey Davis</a>:<br>On Adam Waldman's previous client, Oleg Deripaska:<br>""If you’ve read the five volumes of the US Senate’s investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election, you know the name. If not, he just may be the richest man you’ve never heard of. With an estimated worth of $6.2 billion, <strong>Oleg Deripaska is a Russian billionaire and Kremlin insider.</strong> In a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2017, he was described as one of “2-3 oligarchs Vladmi Putin turns to on a regular basis.” <strong>He’s been denied U.S visas for his suspected connections to Russian organized crime</strong>...</p>
<p> In reaction to the charges by Heard and her legal team, Waldman tweeted, “Ms Heard’s Counterclaim are the allegations of fake petitions and non-human bots and trolls and some kind of dastardly Cyrillic Russian involvement!! And the spiders from Mars…""</p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1301170034023292929"" rel=""nofollow"">The Hollywood Reporter Senior Editor Eriq Gardner September 2</a>:  ""Amazing that this lawyer in the midst of a defamation fight tweets out something false about me even after being told it’s false. What’s more, stunning that he can’t help himself even as he’s apparently about to fight having to give a deposition about social media activity. ""</p>
<p>""... against Adam R. Waldman, Esquire.<br>You state that Mr. Waldman is “. . . inciting online social media against people . . .” and “. . . harming the legal trials . . .” on Twitter involving his client, Johnny Depp’s case before Fairfax County Circuit Court. You state that Mr. Waldman’s tweets amount to witness intimidation and coercion, and that this behavior is also damaging to the public and reporters. You also state that the judge presiding over the case appears to discourage this behavior.<br>We decline to open a formal investigation of this matter, as this is a pending case and the parties may address this issue with the court. If the Court finds that Mr. Waldman has engaged in impropriety, such as violating a gag order, or if the Court holds Mr. Waldman in contempt of court, you may write to us again...""</p>
<p><strong>Notice how Amber Heard can describe very dangerous, visually horrible acts of violence against her, including strangling, burning threats, intimidation, and bruised ribs, and Depp has revealed in the audio leaks that he says Amber ""cannot deck him.""</strong></p>
<p>Online perceptions were attempted to be altered by referring to Amber truthfully stating she was 115 lbs and that any fight would not be fair. Evidence that would be supporting Amber Heard is twisted by these accounts online. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/cyrillic-russian-spiders-from-mars/"" rel=""nofollow"">According to Joey Davis and The Geek Buzz, who as been following this case for one and a half years</a>: ""In January 2018, Twitter disclosed its security personnel assess that over 50,000 automated accounts linked to Russia were tweeting election-related content during the U.S. presidential campaign...</p>
<p>The types of AI used to power these bots, and the mentality of paid and hobbyist trolls who purposely spread disinformation, isn’t always reserved for elections, but it’s always political. Case, or cases, in point: Trolls and bots that auto-post negative reviews en masse of games, movies, and TV shows that usually feature women and people of color in empowered roles. When Larry Johnson of Entrepreneur Magazine wrote about this in December of 2019, he was already late to the game because Captain Marvel (here and here), Starwars, Batwoman, and others had already fallen victim to the practice...""</p>
<p><strong>Notice how tabloids and media will insert a single claim against Amber, which the enabling culture and institutions that Amber described, will use to claim her detailed descriptions and data are not valid... Yet, the violence and abuse against Amber Heard is clearly documented and heinous. </strong></p>
<p><strong>One example even describes raw meat left around the house, when that supposed previous partner of ex-staffer from last year wrote that Depp is fascinated with serial killers...</strong></p>
<p>""...Today, NGN’s lawyer Sasha Wass QC asked Heard, 34, about the incident in Australia in March 2015, when Ms Heard alleges Mr Depp was taking MDMA and drinking heavily....</p>
<p>Ms Wass asked Ms Heard about the evidence of Ben King, Mr Depp’s previous estate manager, on the damage to the house in which they were staying – which included broken windows, graffiti on mirrors and blood and paint on the walls and floors....</p>
<p>She added: ‘He had burned holes through some cushions and through some lampshades, blood and paint, more messages on cushions, there was a couch flipped over. ‘It appeared to be he had set fire to one of the cushions because the carpet was burned around it a little.</p>
<p>‘My paints were out, it appeared to be that maybe he had either thrown or dropped paint on the floor and on the wall. More messages in paint and blood, I could see both textures.</p>
<p>‘I found raw meat, at first I didn’t know what it was, on the floor. Not just on the floor, I continued to find it… that day, hidden in various places.</p>
<p>‘He had taken my nightgown and ripped it into shreds. He wrapped pieces of food (in it).’</p>
<p>Ms Heard said there was a ‘significant pooling of blood on the floor, on the steps leading to the stairs. I could see my own bloody footprints (from the night before) but I could also see what appeared to be dropped blood’. She said: ‘I assumed it was from my own arms and hands and feet.’</p>
<p>Ms Heard continued that, when she got downstairs, Mr Depp was playing ‘death metal, blasting really loud’ and she could see ‘tonnes of broken glass’.</p>
<p>Ms Heard added: ‘There were windows broken, there was so much glass on the floor I could barely find a pathway to walk. There was damage left in the house in March 2015 (Picture: PA/PA Wire) ‘The ping pong table was broken and on the ground.’</p>
<p>... Ms Heard replied: ‘Yes, about 24 hours into his binge, rage, I had previously come downstairs… I knew he just needed to eat or sleep and the moment I described yesterday, where he offered the bottle to me, this is after he had held me up against the fridge by my neck.</p>
<p>‘He was screaming at me for ruining his life, he said over and over again that I ruined his f***ing life and that he wished he had never met me and that I did this… I made him this mad, I made him drink, I did this and I always did this.</p>
<p>‘He held a bottle up against my face, he told me that he would slice up my face.</p>
<p>‘I accept at some point I either pushed him or pushed his arms off me...</p>
<p>‘It was after that moment or after those moments, he was so angry he punched the wall… he started hitting the wall, he was punching the wall and he got carried away in that moment.</p>
<p>‘He saw the phone… it was kind of a mint green, cream Bakelite, plastic mounted phone on the wall and he picks it up and the hand that had been on my neck loosened a little bit as he was focused on the phone and I stepped back… while he proceeded to, instead of punching with his hand, his fist, he used the phone.’</p>
<p>Ms Heard told the court that Mr Depp smashed the phone ‘repeatedly, over and over again, into the wall, screaming at the top of his lungs and I watched as this phone just was disappearing in front of my own eyes’. She said that when Mr Depp was smashing the phone against the wall ‘it was breaking off in shards’.</p>

<p>We submitted online reports and emails to organizations about the hate crimes against Amber Heard, (in the UK, hate crimes can be before it is violent, such as verbal, written, online, and abusive) including how it escalated outside the UK trial, to <a href=""https://www.stophateuk.org/report-hate-crime/"" rel=""nofollow"">Stop Hate UK</a>, which said they'll periodically monitor it online, but without permission from the victim (we do not talk to Amber Heard), couldn't report it further.</p>
<p>We're actually involved with advocating and <strong>trying to start public safety technology that is victim-centered to save lives</strong> for almost 2 years now. Amber Heard's case demonstrates enabling culture, witness issues, and how data needs to be collected. People should be evaluating how even with data, United Nations support, and positive leadership, how culture is pushed against Amber Heard. </p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.equalitycantwait.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Equality Can't Wait</a>, it will take 208 years before women are equal in the United States. The online institutions are not helping, and actually are pushing it backwards with hateful enabling and discrimination.</p>
<p>Could you imagine going through such violence and abuse, then all of these institutions, false accounts, tabloid media, and more try to ruin your leadership, self-sufficiency, or any progress?</p>
<p><strong>Even with domestic abuse being the most commonly experienced incident, when a public figure such as Amber Heard comes forward to lead against it with influence, it's then a battle to try to keep awareness, as power works to try to silence and stop their advocacy.</strong></p>
<p><em> Many Women's places have closed during COVID-19, when domestic abuse and cyberabuse is increasing, and there is <a href=""https://www.safehavencommunity.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">no crowdsourced help or housing</a> in the United States. </em></p>
<p>Why is it taking such a long time to stop the abuse against Amber Heard? Look into these questions and work on solutions.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Sun case (Depp vs NGN) under Judge Andrew Nicol shows extensive details of violence and abuse from <em><strong>data collecting</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We recommend watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csQ747x9Hws"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> to get a clearer understanding of how so much abuse can happen in a culture that ignores it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Amber Heard was threatened with a knife by Johnny Depp, was hit multiple times in Domestic Violence, and physically injured.</strong></em></p>
<p>This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csQ747x9Hws"" rel=""nofollow"">video (Amber Heard is Innocent 2)</a> shows the background that witnesses of the domestic abuse refused to speak publicly because of the<em> Hollywood and cultural setting which doesn't reward helping victims</em> - <em>even if it's the right thing to do</em>.</p>
<p>In this video, Amber Heard is threatened by Johnny Depp with a knife after she refuses to cut him when he asks her to, and <strong>he mocks her about scars and going to court</strong>. <strong>A video shows JD saying he headbutted Amber, but ""that wouldn't break a nose."" </strong></p>
<p>A <em>photo of missing Anthony Fox</em> was sent by an alleged romantic partner of ex-staff saying staff are threatened with it since he wanted to testify against Depp (linked to earlier with screenshots from last year). <strong>Similarly, Evan Rachel Wood, who was abused by JD's best friend, Marilyn Manson, is shown reading a testimony that Manson threatened people</strong> if they wanted to expose him and threatened Evan with killing himself, <em>yet at the same time violently abusing her and causing fear for numerous people</em>.</p>
<p>She passed <strong>Phoenix Act</strong>: <a href=""http://PhoenixAct.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://PhoenixAct.com</a></p>
<p><strong>This video links Hollywood/Los Angeles culture (claiming women want fame and they shouldn't stand up for victims), Hate Online for being a woman and sexuality/LGBT identities, and covering up abuse with bystanders. </strong></p>
<p><em><strong><a href=""https://www.ihollaback.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hollaback</a> is shown encouraging interfering to stop abuse and Duty to Rescue Law to create liability for not helping others.</strong></em></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>We say that people should use technology to stop violence against women - Amber Heard data collected evidence.</strong></p>
<p>Upon the above about financial, legal, or publicity resources referenced, is that Amber Heard <em><strong>data collected</strong></em> her injuries, the abuse, and situations with texts, videos, and audios.</p>
<p><strong>If she did not collect this Data, likely, Amber Heard could have never become a Leader on Gender Equality or speak out against her abuse with evidence in spite of any intimidation of witnesses or unhelpful bystanders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>She did the right thing by coming forward and knowing that her abusive situations were wrong in order to keep evidence.</strong></p>
<p>You can have money for lawyers or be a public figure, but without evidence as referred to in the proposal that passed <a href=""http://phoenixact.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Phoenix Act</a> to extend the statute of limitations, including from this progressive example on data collecting, there may no witnesses or intimidated witnesses, and that can stop help for the victim. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Update July 21, 2020:</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer Adam Waldman and others around this case have incited people (and simulations) online to intimidate witnesses and supporters from speaking up, since they are afraid of it impacting their lives, safety, and business relationships.</strong> Adam Waldman also told the NGN in an email that Amber Heard looked like 'gone girl' in February.</p>
<p>She had over 40,000 hateful comments on one IG post. We went onto <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/motivatornetwork/"" rel=""nofollow"">our instagram</a> that month with the purpose to help her.</p>
<p>July 20, 2020: ""MW is now making a complaint about Adam Waldman (who has been tweeting from Court 13) what MW says are <strong>threatening tweets about the witness evidence</strong> - <strong>particularly the “in memoriam”</strong> tweet which is says is macabre.

<p>Journalists have repeatedly responded to the faceless adam_waldman twitter account as if it's a real account. It's posting inciting claims.</p>
<p><strong>The social media companies are not protecting witnesses, victims, or legal cases.</strong> They also do not data collect for it, which is another reason we took screenshots of that alleged partner of ex-staff last year - it would have been lost.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fathers4justice-johnny-depp-amber-heard-court-case-libel-trial-divorce-law-a9628351.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a hateful billboard was seen outside the trial</a>, with groups calling for it to be questioned as 'hate crime' (against women). It is from a UK website for men divorcing women. The group claimed it was the best advertisement in the world for divorce against women. </p>
<p>We've been repeatedly asked if we have been paid to help Amber Heard. <em>The answer is and will always be no.</em> It actually pays <strong>less</strong> to help Amber Heard, because hate and bullying is profitable.</p>
<p><em><strong>We help because we're not bystanders and feel obligated to help her life.</strong> This is nonprofit.</em></p>
<p>Update July 26:</p>
<p>Online crowdfunding harms helping Amber Heard's side to be seen. In fact, we cannot link to reporter <a href=""https://www.nickwallis.com/closing-submissions"" rel=""nofollow"">Nick Wallis's website</a> because they re-ordered the witness statements in that you cannot see clearly whose witnesses are whose, and shows JD's photo instead of AH's (or NGN's). Confusion with irrelevance has been used to prevent her from being supported.</p>

<p>Despite her strong evidence, humanitarianism, charity, and leadership, she is questioned online by incited hate and a ""Wild West"" online cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong>If you see something, do something! </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a road map of Amber's innocence in her case.</strong> For example, her arguing, speaking up, or yelling led to 3 physical fights as retaliation by JD against her in the 1 1/2-2 months before audio leak 1.</p>
<p><strong>We support Amber Heard! Interfere online!</strong></p>
<p>Recently L'Oreal which supports Amber Heard endorsed Hollaback's mission to stop harassment. We think technology should be used to help people, and false information and hate is harmful.</p>

<p><strong>-- Believe Abuse Against Women Early, Interfere, and Support Their Leaving --</strong></p>
<p>#StopDomesticViolence - We list Her Side below...</p>
<p><strong>HER SIDE: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>She feared for her life and that JD would 'accidentally' kill her.</strong></li>
<li>She believes JD is an abuser. <strong>She refers to abuse &amp; violence in December, May, and April.</strong>
</li>
<li>IO Tillett called 911 because of escalating violence and she feared physical harm and needed to protect herself.</li>
<li><strong>Bodyguards told her off record that she would be killed, and one is recorded on a phone witnessing violence.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Travis (guard) had to pull JD away from Amber. (JD admits this)</strong></li>
<li><strong>She has collaborating photos and text messages to her mother, family, and friends as proof.</strong></li>
<li><strong>She missed work because of fear of bruising and injuries the next day, and texted Jodi</strong></li>
<li><strong>(Amber Heard is crying, intimidated, and stressed - in the audio and life)</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>She is defending herself</strong> and says it makes JD angry that she defends herself. He is attacking her with abuse even on the phone call.</li>
<li>She has documented evidence, and eyewitness statements over the years of abuse who would provide statements under oath.</li>
<li>She has collaborating texts, photos, and statements with time stamps and matching dates of abuse.</li>
<li>Texts between people, people overhearing their fights, people seeing it the next day of abuse, or responding to the abuse.</li>
<li>She says JD doesn't believe her (crying) and it's pointless, but she's telling the truth with the timeline matching.</li>
<li>She was told she had a strong case of domestic violence, and if she filed against JD, they would prosecute him. She said she wanted to protect him and waited for the RO.</li>
<li>She says she doesn't want to hurt him.</li>
<li>She says JD used TMZ, tabloid media, to smear her credibility. She was *forced* to respond and defend herself.</li>
<li>TMZ was creating lies while she was in LA Court about there not being two sets of police officers at the penthouses. They subpoenaed the the security records as proof.</li>
<li>She cannot overpower him, and there's a large physical difference between them. He claims she 'started' the fights. She has photos, audio, and texts* of abuse. No fair fights in strength or ability.</li>
<li><strong>She, her family, and her friends have received death threats - which is not safety.</strong></li>
<li>JD gets angry about Amber Heard saying he is sending info to the tabloid media and raises his voice, saying she didn't 'make nice nice' and will see her in court.</li>
<li>JD tells Amber she 'doesn't exist to him.' Amber Heard says he doesn't need to be cruel on top of it.</li>
<li>JD says going to court will harm both of them and is telling Amber Heard to use the NDA and written letter to settle.</li>
<li>JD is telling her to not go to court.</li>
<li>JD tells Amber he knows she wants to defend herself and respond.</li>
<li>JD acknowledges fights between Amber and him in the past, it's already known and out there, and mentions the NDA &amp; letter.</li>
<li>She says her credibility was dishonestly smeared. JD says the abuse needs to be dealt with (NDA).</li>
<li>JD blames Amber for being *forced* to defend, protect herself, and to respond and for the smearing of her in the tabloid media and online.</li>
<li>Amber Heard did not want any of this to happen and to be forced to defend herself, but JD won't believe her. She has the timeline (crying).</li>
<li>She says she only has her integrity...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amber Heard has a long-term leadership, humanitarian, positive background with credibility: </strong></p>
<p>She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office. She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.</p>
<p>- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, and Human Rights Campaign.</p>
<p>- Spoken at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala.</p>
<p><strong>She's Mera in the movie Aquaman. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We created this video &amp; petition because we would prevent &amp; stop abuse against women... </strong></p>
<p><strong>Don't be a bystander or go with crowds - dig &amp; look into the story, stand up for underdogs, &amp; understand the situational stress involved and social status dynamics.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B9nIeehoSdx/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">ACLU further is against harassment of women online</a>, and we can see that it creates distortions to escalate violence, threats, discrimination, and lack of safety. </strong></p>
<p>Her ex, further, <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/depp-fails-comply-judges-orders-amber-heard-files-motion-continuance"" rel=""nofollow"">has refused to provide evidence during discovery</a>, including the <strong>70,000 texts and emails</strong> sent to The Sun, which is now known by the parties for Amber Heard. Although <a href=""https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Depp-v-News-Group-decision-on-disclosure-FINAL.pdf#page=9"" rel=""nofollow"">the texts between Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany</a> were not allowed in the UK because they were sent without permission, even if they show clear violence and threats with graphic details, it's still being exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: On March 18, 2020:</strong> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B94hFCcqqd_/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>In UK Court again, texts</strong> between JD and his doctor</a> reveal that he admits twice to harming his own finger during the 3 day blackout where he abused and assaulted Amber Heard in Australia as seen in the <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/18/johnny-depp-told-doctor-chopped-finger/"" rel=""nofollow"">Telegraph</a>. However, the exploitation of social status online caused mobs to believe lies from JD accusing her, despite it being not logical for afar vs close up.</p>
<p>It possibly ended up beneficial that JD caused the case to be postponed to August in the end by refusing to provide evidence, since The Sun case is beforehand and provides credibility, as well as exposing the other violence and abuse in texts as if precedence.</p>
<p><strong>Court documents in Virginia from March 16, 2020 show that witnesses such as Laura Divenere have been coerced</strong>, given leading questions, given false information, and intimidated by JD's lawyer Adam Waldman. A <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6811708-Laura.html"" rel=""nofollow"">recorded conversation's transcript</a> shows the inappropriate actions by Waldman.</p>
<p><strong>It's clear that there are continuing moves to cover up the domestic abuse of Amber Heard and ruin her humanitarian work, resources, and any positive support. </strong></p>

<p>'<strong>Warner Bros. doesn’t care about the allegations made about Amber Heard nor do they have interest in social media.</strong> <strong>As such, there’s nothing going on with her role on Aquaman 2 and they wouldn’t consider firing her.</strong> The petitions to get her dropped from L’Oreal are also highly unlikely to go anywhere with the company. L’Oreal runs Amber Heard’s social media pages and are very fond of her.'</p>
<p>The source continues to explain there’s a lot more going on with the case as well, including evidence that could be damaging against Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>'In fact, there’s much more to these allegations than what’s been revealed so far. This is why Amber Heard hasn’t settled with Johnny Depp. While the audio recordings with Amber Heard don’t look good, <strong>Amber still has incredibly damaging evidence</strong> against Johnny Depp. With that said, Amber Heard and her legal team have chosen to do everything involving their case in court rather than rely on social media.'""</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZwWGBfApM4"" rel=""nofollow"">Amber Heard spoke at the Women's March in Los Angeles</a> in January</strong>, referring to 3 years where she suffered.

<p>""That's why many of us choose to not speak up,"" stated Amber Heard.</p>

<p>It's <strong>preventive, rather than reactionary</strong>, as we see with other ""Free [name here]"" movements, such as Kesha or Britney Spears, it's often done too late or afterwards. It affects everyone in the industry and it can affect people around public figures, such as ex-staff or <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE"" rel=""nofollow"">those knowing them</a>. They're <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/"" rel=""nofollow"">not bulletproof</a>. </p>

Originally, it was 400 to be disclosed. However, it was sent civilly, and not to the law. Someone possibly did the ethical and right choice. It's shown earlier that ex-staff or others <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE"" rel=""nofollow"">may be too afraid to testify</a>. Similarly, a paralegal spoke up about Spears. We can see similar movements, if it's noticed.</p>
<p><strong><em>In dangerous situations such as Amber Heard is in</em> involving physical abuse, threats to life, coercive control, collusion, and high amounts of money, it's especially important for people to protect and stand up for the victim. </strong></p>
<p>Are We All Celebrities Now? <strong><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/amber-heard-revenge-porn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Amber Heard spoke up for others and equal rights in her New York Times Op-Ed</a>.</strong></p>
<p>""Denying the right of anyone, famous or not, to exercise control over who is allowed to see their naked bodies or to witness their intimate activities is to deny their humanity...</p>
<p>Today everyone is one step away from becoming famous. The power of social media makes it possible for any person to be dragged before the eyes of the world...</p>
<p>Every person, from the most famous to the most obscure, from the privileged to the poor, deserves privacy.""</p>
<p>How you treat public figures expands outwards and sets an example. There should be equal status.</p>
<p>We link to it, and <strong>we want Amber Heard's humanitarian work and leadership to continue. To do that, she needs to keep her career and resources.</strong></p>
<p>We are glad that Amber protected herself against the cyberbullying on IG which also likely included paid comments to boost negativity with spam to create false online distortions. Ex JD was already a liability to producers with numerous lawsuits, and her Washington Post Op-Ed was written the month <em>after</em> he lost 1 role while he has others and high financial means.

We ask: <strong>""Would you save her""?</strong></p>
<p>Simple question, but it's on our petition to <strong>Support Amber Heard in Aquaman 2</strong>: <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2</a></p>
<p>We also refer to charity &amp; activism. It's olympic about how many nonprofits Amber is involved with and many who did not have public support.</p>
<p><strong>This petition was shortly changed and emailed to DC and Warner Brothers before Melissa came out about domestic abuse with her 14 minute video here a week ago: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4LZGXZgxg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4LZGXZgxg</a></strong></p>
<p>""I stand with Melissa Benoist"" and ""We stand with Amber Heard.""</p>
<p>They're NOT bulletproof.</p>
<p>Melissa Benoist, Supergirl of the DC/WB, <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/"" rel=""nofollow"">was able to say that she defended herself and still received support.</a> Amber Heard was one of the first or only people to state she was domestically abused as the larger victim. Amber dealt with the mobs against her, and likely because of that, Melissa is able to come forward even if there were two-way fights. </p>
<p>There's an <a href=""https://twitter.com/AmberHeardIT/status/1203988651820101632?s=20"" rel=""nofollow"">Instagram video from Amber which may be hidden clues</a>. While looking tired, she says ""Because of this hair and pajamas, it must mean I am bulletproof."" <strong>She's not actually bulletproof</strong> and frequently people will put in metaphors and hidden messages on their social media, because they're unable to be public today. </p>
<p>This photo with a pillow is interesting, since it escalated in the fights to her waking up to a bloody pillow which was seen by IO Tillett: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B6EHDuthyjF/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/p/B6EHDuthyjF/</a></p>
<p>Will you be the change?</p>
<p>There's also an article that maybe Mera of Aquaman will get a Spin-Off movie. We hope that is true. <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/amber-heard-reportedly-getting-her-own-mera-spinoff-movie/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/amber-heard-reportedly-getting-her-own-mera-spinoff-movie/</a></p>
<p><strong>To prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED!</strong> Believe early, let them escape early. We were told to not screenshot a partner of ex-JD staff's tweets and messages, but we DID. We were also told to not create a petition, but we DID.</p>
<p>Jane Doe said: <strong>""celebrities hiding bruises while going to events is common...""</strong></p>
<p>The Jane Does saying she was the partner of Ex-JD staff supported Amber and said she was kicked, hit, and crying.

<p>Amber Heard and Melissa Benoist are<em> CRIME VICTIMS</em> which should also be a protected class.</p>
<p><strong>If you don't support victims now, then the agenda to silence them will continue. Duty To Rescue and Duty to Care.</strong></p>
<p>We also got the database fixed for the article on Amber's friend calling 911 for her.

<p><strong>We want to see her in more films, movies, shows, modeling shoots, and work in the entertainment industry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want powerful women who can be respected and treated equally.</strong></p>
<p>We created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. Would you prevent or stop domestic abuse? The social question is also: ""Would you save her?""</p>
<p>Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his fans, both financially and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.</p>
<p>Amber Heard wrote in the Washington Post about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from Depp fans and how she supports rights: ""Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."": <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html</a></p>

<p>IO Tillett witnessed blood on a pillow and was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a></p>
<p>According to anonymous sources on social media, Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2qFCFd-5C8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2qFCFd-5C8</a></p>
<p>It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.</p>
<p>We have to take a stand now. They're trying to remove Amber Heard's jobs, career, resources, financial support, and they harass her and organizations (even the charities, UN, and ACLU) for years for supporting her.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality.</strong></p>

May 20, Johnny's mother died. After a long severe illness. Knowing his love and affection for her, you can try to imagine what his emotional state was! In deep grief and mourning! Even if that were the type of outbreaks of aggression, everything is easily debited to the state of affect. And in April-May, he probably wanted to spend time next to his mother, and not this all since the pile of shit on the bed and everything that happened after ... And the fact that Amber-gang became active at this particular time leads to different thoughts. And Heard describes  as a soulless, heartless creature, not capable of a gram of sympathy (which is normal even strangers are capable of), but only putting shit in the literal and figurative sense ... It’s clearer who is who view of logic, common sense and moral and ethical standards.<br>On May 20 of this year (Monday) Johnny presented in court a declaration of how Amber scoffed at him.

11,StarterPetitionUpdate,24514140,2019-05-05T19:01:02.000Z,,Abuse and gender roles,"<p>I planned this post 2 weeks ago, but more important topics appeared. Today, I think, it is time.<br>Let's look at what is abuse and talk a little about gender roles. To make it a little clearer. I began to read psychological articles on this topic, and I really did not like one thing! Most articles emphasize that a man is a rapist, a woman is a victim. Absolutely stereotypical thinking in our time, when stereotypes are crumbling everywhere. If we are talking about equality, then not only equality of rights, but also equality of responsibility! And I think Johnny suffers in part from this stereotypical thinking too! And with certain efforts, the “Depp case” could be a precedent for the protection of male victims!<br>Why it happens? Yes, probably men are mostly physically stronger (although not always!). But an abuse (as it is written in those articles) is not only physical violence, but also moral, emotional, psychological ... And this is already the ""power"" of women. Tell me, who better get the brain out?;) The answer is unequivocal, with a few exceptions.<br>In addition, because of these same stereotypes, men find it harder to fight. Potential victims are most likely brought up so that you can not raise a hand against a woman. And if he answer, then what will happen? Public opinion will say ""AAA, he is a scoundrel, he beats women!!!"" And now he find yourself guilty. Secondly, it is difficult to tell someone, complain. They will be called a wimp and a rag. Also so-so pleasure. It remains to endure and be silent, increasingly destroying his personality. Only in a truly equal society should all cases be treated in the same way and everyone should be entitled to protection.</p>
<p>So what are the signs of an abuse?<br>Constant quibbles to the smallest shortcomings (the fact that ideals do not exist in principle are completely ignored), jealousy, bans on communication with family and friends, total control, humiliation and disrespect for values ​​and needs (I can, but you don’t). The unpredictability of punishments. It is very difficult to understand what you are doing wrong. From this the feeling of guilt and inferiority is fixed in the victim. And the alternation of periods of violence with periods of peace, when it seems that everything is finally adjusted. And the abuser gives it all as a concern for a partner, so at the beginning of a relationship it can be difficult to figure out where you are. And this is a big danger.<br>(And now look at Amber and her relationship with Johnny, and you will see all this. Google to help). For illustration - one of her fresh photos. Eloquently enough</p>","{'id': '222046605', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/os/lr/JlOsLRVwleZUMpr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1557082864', 'processing': False}}",,,warner-brothers-save-johnny-depp-as-gellert-grindelwald-in-the-movie-fantastic-beasts,,against

<p>Warner Bros. announced the third “Fantastic Beasts” film will hit theaters on Nov. 12, 2021. Production on the movie is expected to begin in spring of 2020.

<p>2. Johnny is ready to fight to the end to clear his name!</p>
<p>“His response to her latest motion to dismiss (transfer venue) is due on Monday, May 20, after which Amber’s reply will then be due May 31. <br>Johnny will lay out proof of his allegations that Amber and her friends carried out a series of abuse hoaxes targeting him. With no hearing date yet set, and a series of motion victories behind him, he has already put a lot of time and energy into clearing his name from her nasty allegations.”</p>
<p>“As long as it takes, Johnny will use the courts to carry out justice until his name in Hollywood is cleared and his reputation is restored. She harmed him a lot back when he wasn’t defending himself; now he recognizes he must engage fully in this legal battle until her allegations are totally disproven. Johnny is not going to get trampled on any longer.”</p>
<p><strong>Adam Waldman: “Before the evidence fully reveals this previously arrested, violent abuser’s latest charade, here is a question: what actual abuse victim presents an easily disprovable hoax to the court to obtain a temporary restraining order when they claim to possess other real evidence of abuse,” Johnny’s attorney continued. “That Amber Heard is allowed to pretend none of this is happening, and glide from one ‘philanthropic’ photo op to the next, is a grotesque insult to the pain and experiences of real abuse victims of every gender.”</strong></p>

Please remind the petition and familiar and unfamiliar!<br>Today about the current.<br>Earlier this week, it was announced that Amber Heard stylist Samantha McMillen testified in court that in the days when Johnny allegedly severely beat Amber (December 15, 2015 and May 24, 2016), there were no signs of violence on her! These are very important readings! And after a couple of days, suddenly everyone starts writing about a Johnny's new girl. And it is replicated everywhere, unlike the information about the court! Accident? I do not think! Most likely - conscious stuffing and provocation from those who are very afraid of losing! Therefore, it is simply necessary not to pay attention to this, not to participate in the ""yellow"" discussions, not to be distracted from the main thing! Naturally wanting Johnny happiness, good luck and prosperity.</p>
<p>And a little comment by Alice Cooper on Johnny's lyrics on the new Hollywood Vampires album:</p>
<p>""I think [Johnny] wrote a lot of songs on this album that are [to] get back at people,"" Cooper tells Ultimate Classic Rock in a new interview. ""[The album's first single] 'Who's Laughing Now' is him going, 'Okay, you've set out everything you can do to destroy me, who's laughing now? I'm still here. And I'm making these records and I'm still going to make movies and I'm still a better actor than most of the people out there. Who's laughing now?' There's two or three songs like that on the album that I'm singing and going, 'Wow, I'm the voice of Johnny's anger. [Laughs] Normally, I'm writing songs that concern me. Now, I'm sort of the mouthpiece for Johnny, which is great.""</p>",,,,warner-brothers-save-johnny-depp-as-gellert-grindelwald-in-the-movie-fantastic-beasts,,against

(If suddenly someone does not know, this is the band in which Johnny plays the guitar).<br>Without taking a direct meaning now, but a little about something else ... Johnny is an actor from God! He is not a performer, he is a Creator, an Artist! He does not do only what is written in the script, and what the director wants, he changes, processes, thinks out ... He makes the character live, not cardboard. And for the attentive viewer in his roles there is always a thought, a meaning, a message...<br>And such a person has recently been trying to extinguish. Constantly diverting his attention to the courts and the prosecution, one is more ridiculous than the other. This is real sabotage! To distract from filming, blocking roles and already finished films (as happened with the City of Lies)... Not to give the Message... This is much more serious than if it were only for him, it is a crime against culture and world cinema, deicide (also the word from the song).<br>Let it sound loud, but it's true, Johnny Depp is already in the gold fund, no matter what happens next, but I really want him to do a lot more so that we have Grindelwald and many others.

<p>Some news. But first we need to remember the old omen ""a thief often shouts first: ""hold the thief!""""</p>
<p>In the trial Depp with his former lawyers from the firm Bloom Hergott about financial differences, suddenly appeared the topic Amber Heard. Bloom Hergott suddenly wanted to ask former Warner Bros. chairman Kevin Tsujihara did Johnny ask him to remove Heard from Aquaman and blacklist at the studio or not.</p>
<p>Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, tells The Blast, “The Hollywood Reporter story alleging Johnny Depp attempted to ‘blacklist’ Amber Heard from Aquaman is a last-ditch effort by defendants to smear Mr. Depp using an evidence-free media and clickbait. It is merely the latest false assertion, anonymously injected into the media by defendants being sued by Johnny Depp for tens of millions of dollars, purposed to save their skins and delay a looming day of reckoning in a court of law.” Waldman claims that not only did Depp not try and have Heard fired from “Aquaman,” it’s really the other way around. He says, “Grotesquely, the truth is the opposite of their latest ""blacklist allegation"": according to the New York Post, ""senior executives at Warner Bros.,"" who are the company’s #Metoo leadership and personally close with Amber Heard, claimed a week ago that Warner Bros. would throw Johnny Depp off the ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie franchise in which he stars because of Ms. Heard’s abuse hoax, notwithstanding that it has been thoroughly disproven by police and other sworn testimony, photographs, audio tape and 87 surveillance videos. Ms. Heard has herself previously been arrested and incarcerated for domestic violence.”</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Waldman, we really hope so!</p>
<p>!!!""These matters will be determined by the Court, not the Hollywood Reporter, nor by People Magazine, whose employee conspired with Ms. Heard to put her hoax on its cover. Mr. Depp will have his days in courts; these lies will never survive the disinfecting sunlight of evidence.”!!!</p>",,,,warner-brothers-save-johnny-depp-as-gellert-grindelwald-in-the-movie-fantastic-beasts,,against

Once we reach 200, Change.org will feature this petition which will in return get us more viewers and recognition. Hopefully getting us more supporters who will sign and share themselves. </p>
<p>I started this petition only 2 days ago after reading Ms. Dauber's horrible and unprofessional tweets. Although I have no ties to Stanford University, Johnny Depp, Camille Vasquez, or any of the organizations they are tied to, I was infuriated that Michele Dauber was not only allowed to continue her name calling and degrading remarks about Ms. Vasquez, Johnny Depp, and their supporters on Twitter, but that Stanford is evidently turning a blind eye to her public display of sexist remarks, defamation, and name calling.  As I stated in the petition description,  if this was a man making these remarks on social media, he would have been blasted by the public and Stanford University would not have tolerated his behavior. They would have suspended him or fired him immediately.  Why is it okay for a woman to do what a man is not? THIS DOUBLE SIDED STANDARDS AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE HAS TO STOP! MALE OR FEMALE, BOTH NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!</p>
<p>PLEASE continue to share the petition link so we can get this petition more visibility and signatures. </p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SIGNING, SHARING AND SUPPORTING THIS!!</p>",,,,remove-michele-dauber-as-a-professor-from-stanford,,against

We have reached a nice milestone of over 5000 signatures who are indisputably standing against Domestic Violence and Domestic Abuse. <br>You are all amazing. If we can have a voice in one shape or form, even if we don't reach the aim, it is definitely through this petition. <br>Wherewith one clear message, we are saying to the world, there is 0% tolerance for Domestic Abuse, for men, for women, for children. For All. </p>
<p>One article said, Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard trial, has given men the hope and strength to come forward. Some anonymously, some with their name upfront. <br>And it absolutely beautiful to see that courage that, even we, men, need. <br>So, without saying more, continue to share, encourage, sign and BE, whether you are a woman or a man, THE VOICE the men and women need. <br>Because they do need you. They do suffer.<br>Thank you. <br>All the best, live strong and with passion.<br>Tine Gustincic</p>
<p>PS<br>We know Twitter can get quite crowded, so we created a fan page for Johnny Depp, in support of him to meet with his justice, and for his truth to come out, for which he has waited for over 6 years. <br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/WeStandWithJohnnyDepp/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/WeStandWithJohnnyDepp/</a></p>","{'id': '226646588', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/na/xu/UQNaxurJAgqbliC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653589491', 'processing': False}}",,,remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-4f951fe9-226c-40e0-a8de-28e1a265546d,,against

Let's make it more acceptable than being told that our 'life has too much drama.' We should make it acceptable to stop abuse of women everywhere and at all levels.</p>
<p>Why is it that when a stranger harms a woman, it causes more of an outcry like Sarah Everard than when it's in their own home or by a partner? <br>Many countries though won't even have any outcries over strangers killing women either. Why not outcry long before?<br>We don't need it to get to that point. It should be before any of that and we should focus on helping female victims long before anything happens.</p>
<p>Your life matters. It should be seen as heroic to speak against abuse and violence of all kinds, especially for other people.</p>","{'id': '225554842', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/jg/yi/fEJGYijgyZUcqAa-800x450-noPad.jpg?1620903083', 'processing': False}}",,,kamala-harris-support-amber-heard-stop-domestic-violence-against-women,,for

<p>I've seen a couple comments saying this is too far or not justified, and in this update I want to address those concerns. I didn't make this petition to attack or destroy Dr. Hughes. In some aspects of her testimony she presents that she is an good CLINICAL psychologist. Meaning she could be highly beneficial in a patient's treatment. She definitely devoted herself to Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>My issue is with her actions in this trial, and any past or future forensic psychology she might be a part of. In forensic psychology, one has to remain separated from the individuals they are asked to examine, in part to prevent bias, but primarily to make sure that justice is carried out. Dr. Shannon Curry was a shining example of this in both her first testimony and her rebuttal testimony. Not only did she not offer an opinion on Mr. Depp's mental state, she also did not offer an opinion in regards to whether or not Ms. Heard was a victim of abuse. She did her examination, evaluation, and testimony on Ms. Heard without believing or disbelieving Ms. Heard's story. THAT is what it is to be a forensic psychologist. You're not a victim advocate, you are only there to provide your professional opinion in regards to what you were asked to assess. THAT is why I created this petition and what I hope to see. I have no issues with Dr. Hughes continuing her clinical practice and hope that she is a benefit to those in need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That being said, I am so excited that we hit 1,000 signatures! Let's set the next goal at 2,000!!!</p>",,,,dr-dawn-hughes-behavior-in-trial-was-biased-and-unethical-sign-now-to-show-your-support,,related

9,StarterPetitionUpdate,30545395,2022-05-12T23:16:41.000Z,,Updated Title and Description & Almost 250 Signatures,"<p>We're almost hit 250 signatures! Thank you everyone who signed and thank you especially to those who are sharing! Please keep sharing so we can get more people aware of and behind this cause!</p>
<p>Remember that this petition isn't just about Johnny Depp or Amber Heard, this is about gender stereotypes and the presumption that only men can commit DV/IPV! We know this just isn't true. Abuse has no gender. This petition is in part to remove someone who can't remember the last time she treated/testified about a male victim of IPV that was perpetrated by a FEMALE abuser (listen to her testimony again, she never describes testifying about male victims of female abusers, only treatment of adults that experienced abuse as a child BY ANOTHER MALE, e.g. priest or a coach, or same sex couples), but also to set the precedent that bias, particularly gendered bias, is neither an ethical, nor appropriate component of being a professional in psychology.</p>
<p>I've also updated the title to be less confusing for those who don't know what the ABPP or the APA are, and I updated the description for spelling/grammar and to make it more readable overall.</p>
