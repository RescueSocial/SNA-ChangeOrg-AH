520295690,"Most despicable actress ever  - now and in Hollywood history.
What time of person videos their spouse as part of their plot to conduct a smear campaign in the media to get his assets?
Someone who was really abused would get resolution via the courts.

And the fact that she got upset when Johnny directly made donations to the charities she specified revealed that she only said that for damage control. 
Very smart of Johnny to make the donations directly without the money passing through her grubby gold digger hands, because then those charities would have never saw any of the money.
Serves her right that she ended up having to pay her legal fees out of her own pocket.
I will never ever see any movie she is cast in. 
She got this Mera role by via the casting couch of the producer and Momoa.

476368544,"Amber Heard is a cruel and vicious woman who has used domestic violence as a form of blackmail. She has caused unreparable harm to our community by casting doubt on women who come forward with claims of abuse. Allegedly, she is an abuser and a narcissistic drug addict. For fact, she is a criminal who has broken the law several times. Amber Heard and her friends iO Tillet Wright, Raquel Rose Pennington, Joshua Drew, and Liz Marz have falsely accused an innocent man of domestic violence in an attempt to extort money from him. They are using this serious matter for their own selfishness and greed. Please do not let them do this without suffering consequences. Do not watch any film with Amber Heard. Do not watch MTV.

464764097,"To: Whom it may concern,
This woman is in the middle of one of the worst and most vile public smear
 campaigns I have ever witnessed. Today she will not be available for a deposition because of an engagement party in NJ & costume fitting in London. The fitting could have been changed. She has demanded justice for herself as well as her friends, speaking non stop to the press since May 27th to any and every tabloid that would buy her story and so called evidence not examined by the LAPD she has accused of being liars and bought off. She won't let the a court appointed expert examine it or a any doctor her so called bruises from May 21st.  Her claims are outrageous and her demands may be blackmail. Having her in this film or any film right now till this is all settled is a statement saying anyone can threaten black mail to someone for money and assets and get away with this. Carry on with their lives as if they have not committed a crime. Please re-cast this role so that the public will want to see this film. It is not fair to the other actors, director, writers and crew, every member of this crew and film deserves better. She is an huge insurance risk. If she can blackmail her own husband, she can cry abuse to anyone anytime for money and attention. Please re-cast her and buy her out if needed for this supporting role for now and do not take the chance till this case is resolved in a court of law and not resolved in the court of social media which is what Ms. Heard has been doing for two weeks now and will continue this onto your set, bringing her toxic persona there for all of you to have tip toe around for whatever time she is there. This may hurt the box profits and then there will be no undoing of this.  Sincerely,  Patty Sherman
