There is enough information and evidence to cast doubt to her claims of having been sexually and physically abused. The ACLU holds all the cards in dropping her as their ambassador for female rights.  If this petition serves it's purpose, it will allow the ACLU to choose an individual with more substantial moral fiber to represent victims, specifically females who have suffered abuse. An individual who is clearly caught on tape of being, at best, verbally abusive in a relationship should not be rewarded in being the spokesperson for individual's who have suffered any type of abuse. </p>",,Revoke Amber Heard's Ambassadorship for Women's Rights with the ACLU,,,,US,,,,,,,revoke-amber-heard-s-ambassadorship-for-women-s-rights-with-the-aclu,published,,,False,False,,False,,[],True,False,,5735,5735,2,1542,208,0,6,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226613316,photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652446204,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652446204,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652446205,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652446204,False,1600,900,photo,1265588759,1265588759,Erin,Manning,Erin,Erin Manning,,,US,,en-US,,[],121,1657988015,1,1654340730,2,1654028762,3,1653008305,3,1652454521,35,1656791931,7,1654230354,73,1656707698.709,7,1656078139.708,11,1653851711.976,7,1654912920.199,17,1657130116.19,57,1657988028.417,9,1654449701.621,[],False,False,False,Erin Manning,Revoke Amber Heard's Ambassadorship for Women's rights with the ACLU,Revoke Amber Heard's Ambassadorship for Women's rights with the ACLU,active,7500,226613316,photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652446204,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652446204,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652446205,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/3/nw/xs/xSnwXSpfkdNDYhn-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652446204,False,1600,900,photo,76.46666666666667
