She was also proven to have lied about Mr. Depp and was the aggressor. It was also proven she domestically and physically abused Mr. Depp. It's imperative the United Nations only has ambassadors that uphold the laws of our country with dignity and respect for all.

Having Amber Heard as the face of the UN HUMAN RIGHTS IS WRONG ON EVERY LEVEL! I will never believe anything that comes out of her mouth.  . Having her face and name associated with the UN shows you don’t care about the women and men who are in Abusive relationships and feel they can’t get out. Over 40 years ago I was in a marriage where my husband did beat me up. You don’t forget. You don’t have to add to or take away from what happened to you. You can forgive but forget NEVER. All Amber Heard as done is lie on the stand. Don’t forget men get abused too. Any consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Amber's own words during cross, the audio, and the witnesses verified that her claim as the survivor of abuse was false. As a survivor of childhood SA, I was mortified watching the trail as Amber's continued to gaslight everyone including her true victim. That was very triggering for me. Someone like her should not be the face representing human rights and those affected by it. She has no right to speak for them.
