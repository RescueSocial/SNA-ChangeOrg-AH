StarterPetitionUpdate,30478710,2022-04-25T14:13:41.000Z,,Justice,"<p>There are  some people who support amber heard and it’s there opinion at the end of the day we can’t change that but everyone who is watching the trial can clearly see she doesn’t care about anything besides herself, You can see johnny depp in pain and how he just wants this to end, as a women myself it’s really shameful to see another women do something like this to a man when a man does domestic abuse on a women than everyone goes crazy and takes her side but if it’s the other way around they still blame the man like come on</p>",,,
StarterPetitionUpdate,30477345,2022-04-25T02:46:45.000Z,,Society justice for Johnny Depp,"<p> people just think that women are the ones that are in abusive relationships and the men are the ones behind them but that’s not always the case, men can be in an domestic abuse relationship, it goes both ways 50% of men are not guilty and 50% of women are not as well, it’s not that always the women is in an abusive relationship our society needs to stop and think about this and not just take one person”s side just because she is a women you don’t need to support her, first look at the facts and see, we need to realize that men can be in such relationships and they need support</p>",,,
