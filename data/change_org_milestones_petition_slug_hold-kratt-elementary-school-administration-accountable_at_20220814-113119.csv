StarterPetitionUpdate,30800204,2022-08-02T21:52:52.000Z,Let's get to 300!,"<p>I have received a call informing me that an investigation into the official complaints filed in late June has begun. In addition, FUSD is aware of this petition and are currently determining if they will be investigating the additional claims listed here. We can’t stop now! The more signatures we get, the harder it will be for them to ignore this. We need to show them that parents, staff, and community members are not willing to stop until we have answers. Let’s break 300 before August 15!</p>",,,,

I encourage everyone to continue to share and sign the petition. Every signature shows FUSD that the community is demanding that administrators be held to the highest standards. Our children deserve better!</p>,,,,
