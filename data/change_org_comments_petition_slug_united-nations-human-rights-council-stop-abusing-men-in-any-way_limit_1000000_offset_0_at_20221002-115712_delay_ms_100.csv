They were there everytime we need someone to talk to. But what most people don't see is men, or fathers. Women are not the only ones who created us. Without men, we wouldn't be here either. People often just acknowledge women for everything, and sometimes, when there's a violence committed in a marriage, they always assume that it's the husband who's at fault. They don't ask both sides anymore because they think men are dominant enough to hurt women. But that's not always the case. Let's take a look at Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Depp lost his prized role in Pirates of the Caribbean being Capt. Jack Sparrow because of the false accusations Heard said and the world believed her because she's a woman. She really made it clear that Depp is the one who's really violent. But the truth is, it's actually her.

We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as I will show with my cases and examples, of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, namely my inhuman violent sexually sadistic brother-in-law and my hateful sexually perverse and extremely manipulative ex-tenant.
Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.

These are my shocking experiences:.

First I was and I am a honest girl and woman, hard working at school, High School and Workplace. Goodlooking and with no sexy dresses. A hardworking wife and mother, fighting for women's rights, girls and childrens rights and human rights, for animal rights and for a clean and good environment. I am a very careful person. But inspite of this, I met many psychopaths and evil persons. Nobody is an island of safety and nobody can say, that evil things cannot crosssing the way of life, every day and every time:


The cases I'll describe in more detail!

Here is a short overview!

I was hunted and stalked on the way to school by a traveling salesman from the area of Aachen at the age of 8 to 10 years for two years by the car. Female neighbors who had seen from the window, that a anonymous car was chasing me, said viciously laughing to my shocked old grandmother, that I was a little slut, if that would already start with men and cars, then I would eventually end up on the street prostitution. None of these stupid and vicious women called the police or anyone else to help, though they saw that in my desperation I ran across the fields for my life. This thing ended with schoolmates and my former teacher, who ambushed the offender and asking him, what he are doing there and the culprit was never seen again, but I did not get any help from women.
The real scandal was the lack of support from my parents in giving me bus money so that I no longer had to walk that lonely and dangerous path where this unknown pedophile was waiting for me every day. My grandfather, a tall, strong man, a pensioner, could easily have accompanied me to school. None of this was done. Is that how a compassionate family behaves?

In high school at the age of 17, I was massively harassed, terrorized and stalked by a classmate. There were female idiots in my class who thought I should finally sleep with him, so that calm would enter the class. It was known, that my harasser was an sexual sadist, because he was a great fan of the misogynist films, ""The last Tango of Paris"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Some stupid girls said, that I am an impertinence with my resistance for the whole class. Because of the fact, the stalker had girl friends in the class, it was planned, that these girls should lure me to a party where I would then be put forcefully under alcohol and drugs and he wanted to gang rape me with numerous friendsn, male classmates warned me, from the concerned girls no warning came. And when he tried every day to throw his heavy school backpack on my head for long-distance practice, which could have ended in a hit with serious or fatal injuries, male classmates intervened, some more than mindless girls were very amused over the show and thought that I should see it as casual fun. The help for me came by male classmates and a female subject teacher, one of the few women in my life that really helped me.
Later, when I had started training in another city, he was seen several times with unknown young men in my train compartment, where they passed me with a sneering smile, then another friend of him was one day suddenly in my company canteen, where he was looking menacingly and silently sat down at my table and also my classmate stalker and two male friends threw me one day powerfully an old umbrella from behind in my back in the main station, so that the umbrella broke. So much for the harmlessness of stalkers.
Above all, I couldn't understand the behavior of the male teachers and class teachers, who watched the daily stalker terror and the sexist remarks of this young perpetrator inactive and often with great amusement. This antisocial lad's behavior was so bad that my two best female class friends dropped out of school while I was sick for a week.

During my first year at the workplace at the age of 18, I became the victim of a rape attempt by a senior colleague. My successful resistance was dismissed as outrageous and unnormal, especially among stupid women who had gone to sleeping around to make carreer, they said if I was thinking to be anything better then the other women. These mindless women bullied me instead of supporting me. I have at that time the support of my boss and a another male collague. For me, it was not surprising that the harasser had an absolutely disgusting porn calender in his office and in my presence he was constantly talking about whether I could compete with these porn stars and show if I have such a figure. My complaints had the loud mocking laughter of the men and the indignation of the absolutely dumbfounded women to say that porn and prostitution were normal and would prevent rapes and only someone who was not right in the head, like me, would be bothered by this porn calender. However, as we learn from the media / criminal cases and crimonological and scientific studies on a daily basis, increasing pornography and prostitution since the sixties has led to worldwide sexual femicide in all countries, especially in Africa, Asia, South America and all Muslim countries/ Arab / Hindu countries. When at the birthday party of my boss a friend of the harasser massively sexually molested me so in that kind that I gave him a hard slap in the face and he wanted to beat me in front of all colleagues who participated with their family in the celebration, it was some men who intervened and helped me. These absolutely totally stupid women on the party said that I was the troublemaker and the wife of the boss had to drive me home to the indignation of the female guests. Mind you, not the harasser, a family man had to leave the celebration, but me. I was bullied for two more years by all horny men and silly women, sleeping around in this authority because of my resilience to the rape and sexual harassment that forced me to quit my civil service.
But what I find incredible to this day is that my parents didn't listen to me and said I shouldn't act stupid, after all, it's about my future career. I find the remarks made by two ex-school friends to my current husband even more incredible, who also worked in this government agency and, in all seriousness, uttered sexist crap of the worst kind to him.
He complained to them about the uninterrupted sexual harassment at the apprenticeship place, to which all young female apprentices, especially myself, were exposed. Some young female colleagues who were friends left the company crying, with nervous breakdowns, accompanied by their angry fathers, after a few weeks, none of them lasted three months.
One of these supposedly so nice school friends said that I should be given notice immediately and that I am unfeminine and abnormal. The other said I was crazy, since when did women have rights and I belong in a closed psychiatric hospital, I should be happy and grateful to be able to work there. That was the end of this friendship, my husband was more than shocked.
After all, I stayed at this supposedly great company for three years before it really got too dangerous for me. If you are declared to be absolutely fair game because you have resisted, the only salvation is the resignation. A hiring manager who wanted me to work in the best department in the company was bullied out of the company, as was a female supervisor who offered me a damn well-paid post after my training. A supervisor who supported me was openly laughed at by female bullies (the sleeping around kind of bitches) while he was crying in the office because his young brother with cancer had died. That was the most unbearable moment for me, how disgusting people can be and still with impunity.

And when my ex-tenant stalked me at the age of 48 and terrorized to this day, there were very stupid women in the forum for stalking victims who sided with the stalker and called me a liar, and they were totally brainlessfemale friends of the stalker, who have bully me ever with anonymously calls, laughing at the phone and always sending me English-language love-couple reunion hotlines on my birthday and New Year's Eve. No trace of female solidarity, only of mockery and terror. Apparently it makes these stupid women happy to blame and bully the victims not the culprits. They were so silly, that they have not noticed, that my Ex-tenant has make many BDSM revenge porns of them, sending me these porns with anonymous E-Mails, calling all women and girls sluts. No comment to the stupity of these women and girls.
Above all, I find the behavior of the administrator for a forum for stalking victims extreme outrageous. He turned out to be a woman-hating sexist, which I noticed damn quickly after two days and then I left the forum too, but not quickly enough as it turned out. At that time it was the only forum for victims of stalking in Germany, in Hesse, because stalking was then considered a minor offense, not a crime. And my stalker also went to school in Hesse, no wonder he found me after two days with a whole pack who verbally attacked me and called me a troll and a liar. The administrator joined in this chorus, saying that I was like his ex-wife and how I came to accuse a young person and he also outed my appearance (that was a mystery to me) and where I lived (was also strange ), although I was registered anonymously and assumed the usual data protection. My supporters in the forum were thrown out and the administrator threatened me and them with the prosecution, for which my supporters complained about him and declared him misogynistic and crazy, because apparently it was going on the whole time that he female stalking victims (that were in the forum at least 90%) declared to be liars and trolls. Why do people give such a brain amputated misogynist idiot a forum for female victims of stalking, I still wonder today. My stalkers must have laughed their heads off, I am very sure.

And at last one of greatest women haters of all:
My brother-in-law and half-brother of my husband, the super-bully and misogynist:
My brother-in-law, a wealthy and successful independent businessman, with mansions, houses at home and abroad, mobbed and terrorized everyone, invariably, but mostly women and girls. He was also still a domestic violent offender, who abused my first sister-in-law and his two children and he is always unpunished. Above all, he humiliated my husband without end. He stopped at no one. Whenever we had family reunions, he always came too late, we were not allowed to start drinking coffee he came, otherwise he was raging. His wife and children always came with blow marks, he constantly insulted me with sexually disgusting comments. I'm a very quick-witted and courageous person, I think, but I've been nearly assaulted by him on several occasions because I objected and stopped him. In one case he wanted to beat the children and his wife at the birthday table of my mother-in-law before my eyes. I intervened and he said he like beating a bitch like me. After everyone was dumbfounded and trembling with fear, I said, go ahead, I've always wanted to use the bonecrusher trick from my judo course on a living subject. And another time, he said to my mother-in-law's old girlfriends that such women as me he would meet otherwise only in brothels. Yes, I said, it has been rumored that you are the main customer in our city brothel, there was now a syphillis epidemic. The two old ladies were trembling all over and snow-white. My brother-in-law slandered me from the beginning ( I was at that time 18 years old), for example when I was in my parents' house with severe pneumonia and high fever, he claimed that he had seen me in the old town at late night with strange men and that I was a bitch. My parents didn't want to see him after that anymore. Or when I applied for an apprenticeship at the tax office, he called as my supposed husband there and said that he would forbid me to work there and that I was pregnant. And because of this lie, I didn't get the job.
He beat his first wife during the two pregnancies, he hated children, he forced my first sister-in-law to have three abortions in one year. He also terrorized and harassed the female employees in his tax advisor office. And he kept saying to everyone who wanted to hear it or not, women were only there to fuck and even for that they were too stupid!
He forced my second sister-in-law to sterilization during a holiday abroad, even though she was only 25 years old and definitely wanted children. Then he named her his free hooker. Before his first wedding, he took underaged girls to his room for sex and then literally chased them away saying that they were worthless whores.
My first sister-in-law found in his well-hidden documents before the divorce, evidence that he was constantly having sex with underaged girls abroad, but nobody wanted to get involved.
After a short time there was no contact with my brother-in-law until today. He verbally and physically terrorized and mistreated his female employees in a extreme way for very long years, a father of a underaged female trainee complained to me and my husband that his daughter had almost committed suicide, I could only point out that he must contact a lawyer and police, what else couldnot done. The brother of my husband deceived and decimated all his business associates and friends. They all complained to me and my husband too about this. At the end, the old parents were on the line, first my very ill old father-in-law, whom the brother of my husband accused in the hospital of being a simulant and that he was a case for the psychiatry. When I intervened, he terrorized my mother-in-law, telling her to ban me form visting the ill old man. He did not achieve that. When my father-in-law died, he bullied my seriously ill mother-in-law, along with his second wife, who had just married him for the money and was a true luxury female. When my mother-in-law, whom we cared for on her own, as well as for my father-in-law, although my brother-in-law had five minutes his office and his house away, became ill during our vacation, a female neighbor asked my brother-in-law for help. That was a goddamn mistake, because he pushed the poor old neighbour woman when he came almost down the stairs, screaming in rage, and my mother-in-law was forced by him and my sister-in-law to pack her things and the poor old woman was leave with their suitcases in tears in the doorway of a retirement home. In the meantime, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and playful grandson have looted my mother-in-law's account, along with the cleaning lady, sharing the most valuable stamps and coins from my father-in-law's collections, jewelry, and elegant clothing. When we got our mother-in-law out of the old people's home, the disaster had already happened. My mother-in-law threatened suicide if we went to the police. So she died completely broken in another modern retirement home, because it turned out that she had severe Alzheimer's. Before, my brother-in-law wrote two bad letters, we could take care of her now, he declines any responsibility. Well, evil exists, right.
I find the behavior of all relatives and also of my brother-in-law's business friends unbelievable, who idly watched all his criminal activities. Doing evil also means idly watching evil. These idiots make themselves just as complicit as the perpetrators themselves. I find so much cowardice simply disgusting and inexcusable. Without these stupid people my brother-in-law would not have gotten this far, but apparently only one person had the courage to stand in his way and that was me of all people, a petite young woman. I would be ashamed to the core and for the last of my days if I were a cowardly idiot like these people.

The female betrayal of female victims is as old as the world. Because of this men worldwide call women dumb and inferior. The female betrayal includes bullying, slander, hate speech, psychoterror, abuse, violence, stalking, participation in FGM, child murder, abortion of female fetuses, femicide, forced marriages, childhood marriages, honor murder, dowry murder, sex murder, sexual torture, acid attacks, witch hunts, sex slavery, rape pornography, forced prostitution. Female treason also means excusing the perpetrators and accusing the victims. This is a worldwide disgrace and must have an end.
No wonder men around the world consider women for stupid and inferior. As long as women and girls behave so unsolidly and meanly, that will remain so.
If you are female and think you are safe at home, at school or at work, my experiences will teach you a better one!

I would advise all women, girls, and female children to learn self-defense and martial arts instead of learning to be beautiful and docile. Because the day could come when it saves their lives.

Later I deterred all the aggressors by telling them I practiced on a Grapfruit in a self-defense course, how to squeeze out the eyes of male aggressors.

I was stalked and hunted for two years with a car by a unknown man(a cowardly pervert) as I was a little school girl on my long and lonley school way. I was between 8 and 10 years old. He wanted to abduct me and rape me and perhaps kill me. All the time he cried out of the car, he has a little girl as me at home, I must fear nothing. In the back of his car, so I can see it, he had a notebook with female nude photos.The last time the man chased me with the car and tried to pull me in the car, I slammed the car door from the outside and clamped his arm in the car door and then ran away over fields, fields and scrub where he could not follow with the car. I saw on his hand a ring, he was married. He verbally abused me out of the car, called me a little slut and whore and threatened to kill me. Nevertheless, this behavior has saved me. Although the offender was tall and strong, I escaped. At that time, I was telling everything to my teacher and classmates which were trying to ambush the man to grab him. But he escaped. and was never seen again. He had still unsuccessfully addressed boys of my age in the village, but he had not hunted them like me. And these boys have noticed that he had an Aachen license plate and a case for traveling salesmen in the backseat. That said, this man was probably nationwide on the road and in my view, he could certainly have raped and killed children everywhere on his trips. No one could have proved it to him then, the DNA search did not exist at that time. What a perverse human pig!

I was bullied and stalked in college and at workplace. I was 17 year old. I got rape threats from a psychopathic classmate (a cowardly idiot). The classmate was an absolutely spoiled son of an innkeeper in Sulzbach an der Murr. When the classmate sexually insulted and scolded me in front of the whole class, I ripped him with his long hair over a bench and hit him with a ruler until it broke. That gave me respect, because he was a very strong and very tall young man. He had many girl friends all the time, changing them like T-Shirts and laughing about them and called them sluts and whores, but in spite of that, he harassed me. Classmates and a female teacher were speaking some hard words to him, after It told them, that this stalker want to rape me with others and was planing that. He defamed me in the whole school and called me a mad slut. What a heinous human pig! He left the school without passed exame. On a rainy night (I had already left school after passing the exam) he beheaded all the flowers and roses below my bedroom window and trampled all the beds in the garden with his very large shoes. The tracks could be seen the next morning. He made telephone terror together with other unknown guys for many years and drifted around the house at night. Destroyed all the flowers under my bedroom window on the ground floor at night and always showed with threatening looks at my station.

And at the workplace there was a rape attempt by a male boss (a cowardly dumb ass)I was 18 years old. At that time I had a limited internship in the building district of the German Federal Post Office in Fellbach. And here was sexual harassment on the agenda. But as a later female supervisor told me, I would be a shame for the whole post office because men are men, but my behavior to openly blame these men can not be excused. I have not heard a greater nonsense in my life. My supervisor gave me a lot of work unnecessarily, so I sat at it until the evening. When we were alone in the office, he came from behind, took me into a strangle hold and tried to throw me down and take off the sweater. I broke free with elbows and kicks, gave him a chin hook that sent him to the ground and then stepped on him. After that, I escaped. I was very angry because his pregnant wife was in the hospital and he bragged in the office, that he slept daily with another girl, they are all sluts and bitches. This offender was very strong, like a bulldog. I told everything to my other big boss and a male collegague. Both said very hard words to the culprit and threatend him with the police. The offender said, he invited me to a cup of coffee and then I got mad. And to others he said that I was a liar and a slut sleeping around. What a cowardly human pig! But they did not believe him. In spite of this I was bullied and harassed by others, because of that and so I terminated my job after three years for a better one.

I was stalked and harassed by an misogynist Muslim ex-tenant (a cowardly asshole) and his entire circle of friends. At that time I was 48 years old. There were damages to property, slander on the Internet, cybermobbing, telephone terror, rape threats and death threats. I got many sadistic rape porns and I was called a slut, which deserves rape. My husband e-mailed the tenant for his outrageous behavior, which then accused us of being liars and stalkers.
My husband reported the tenant on suspicion of terrorism because tenant had the behavior of a terrorist and friendships with very uncanny appropriate people.
Our ex-tenant told us that he was a student of the University of Melbourne and would do an internship at a famous firm in Stuttgart. At the time, I wondered why the university and the firm did not realize which real psychopath they were dealing with.


I think my ex-tenant is a very dangerous man who is capable of anything. Shortly before moving out, he was seen laughing and taking a gun at the head of his then-female acquaintance in a car below the house. At the same time, my husband informed me that the tenant had bought a sadistic porn on the same day, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleeding from me. We knew immediately what had happened. During his short thenant-time he had a girl friend and many One-Night-Stands, but in spite of that, he stalked me. And he defamed me in the neighbour hood as woman, that slept around. After the departure of the tenant informed me the very worried mother of a female tenant in the apartment above him that her daugther was probably drugged with drugs, raped and was now blackmailed. The mother of the female tenant must give her 24.000 ‚Ç¨, the daughter said, she had to pay someone at once. But she said her mother not, who he was. Since the female tenant no longer talked to us and then moved out and probably no police turned on, we could unfortunately do nothing. Anonymous murder and rape threats to me were signed with Jack from Hell. I got a photo sent from the blowjob with about a twelve years old girl or younger, I recognized him on the liver spot and dimples on the chin, on the dark hair and the clothes. And I got anonymous many rape porns with E-Mail with calling me a dumb bitch and prostitute.
From a forum for stalking victims, I and all those who wanted to help me, were bullied out by him and other unknowns within a few days. I was no longer anonymous, because my appearance and my place of residence was described. A pen pal discovered a Bosnian forum where my tenant bragged that he was going to end the conflict with a woman with a bottle in her vagina, attached with a corresponding cruel X-ray image of such a crime. What a sadistic human pig! My tenant was a very tall and very strong man, when I realized that he was planning something evil when I was home alone one day, I invited my parents and let them park their car somewhere else. He came then and was very angry when I was not alone, he was sweating heavily, claiming that he wanted to pay me the rent cash today and pulled out a bundle of unbelievable many money , which seemed very strange to me. He is a masterful psychopathic liar, and capable of anything that I know to be evil.
There are also frequent incidents (during the rental period and even today after removal of the tenant) with nocturnal shots below the house, nocturnal destruction of a flower bank, flower pots, outdoor lamps, outdoor cameras, motion detectors, garden furniture in the garden, digging plants and stone steps at night Removal of the garbage containers or paper containers at night with removal of the contents, nightly damage to the company car (scratching, loosening the wheel nuts, piercing the tires).And until now we hear unknown men nightly around the house, under the house and the garden. A girlfriend of mine saw unknown foreign men in cars under the house nightly together with her friend, these people were driving always quickly away when they saw my girlfriend and her friend. Apart from the fact that he did not even pay his monthly newspaper and told the newspaper I would pay it.
Again and again, someone unknown goes around the house at night. When I threw hard fruit out of the skylight several times a night and hit the shadow, I heard from the sounds that it was a man.
Since my ex-tenant had intercepted mail from me during his tenancy and spied constantly in the paper container at night in discarded postal items, he came so to the addresses of girlfriends, penpals and colleagues. These people were massively harassed on the Internet and privately with telephone terror, property damages, break-ins and burglary attempts. A female friend of mine, who lived below my house, was molested by a whole unknown Arab clique (there were a burglary attempt and rape threats connected with harassment and telephone terror) until she threatened with the police. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, I saw this man again and again at longer intervals nearby, near the house, in the tram, the tram stop in my neighborhood, my workplace, near my girlfriend's apartment, either alone or together with an unknown man or an unknown woman, either in changing cars with different license plates or without a car. With beard, glasses, sunglasses or without. My son also saw him differently in the car parks near his school. When I saw him once in front of the shopping center of our district in the morning, my imitated photos were gone for 6 weeks. On a vacation and a cure, I had an unknown very big man at night on the balcony, which was also noticed by others. In addition, we had two private burglary attempts and a break-in attempt in our Austrian apartment and in a cure tried at night an unknown man to invade in my room. When a movie theater we visited, had to be evacuated because of a decaying, stinking dead animal that unknown people had left behind us, my son and his friend saw our ex-tenant with an unknown woman leaving the cinema. In addition, the ex-tenant repeatedly called me with false identities professionally and privately, so in the presence of my son in December 2015, when I was just was released from a serious tumor surgery from the hospital, my ex-tenant called himself Mr. Unterberg. At the hospital last night, an unknown tall, dark-haired man tried to get into my room, but he was expelled by a fellow female patient. The daughter of a female friend (who herself was exposed to several burglaries and harassment from a group of unknown foreign persons), was gangraped by unknown perpetrators and made a severely disabled. The perpetrators were never identified. The stalking of another girlfriend (Burglaries, harassment by unknown) was so extreme that she goes with her husband many times to the police, but the police could not find out everything, in all other cases it was the same.

Of course, all stalking operations also affected my commute and my workplace and all our office buildings. In the long time of stalking, I changed the departments several times and so did the buildings. Shortly after moving out of the ex-tenant we got a lot of virus mails, porno mails, funny and anonymous calls in the company. In addition, there were burglary attempts at my former workplace. But that was not all, as I later moved within the city in another company building, it started really. Burglaries and attempted burglaries were the order of the day in both company buildings, but our superiors made sure that nothing came out. In one case I was on vacation when all the offices were robbed and devastated, except my office and direct colleagues, which all found damn suspicious. Previously, I had noticed suspicious Arabs in the building who did not belong here, and on my report, my boss suspected me of racism. A little later, in the evening, my chief boss in another company building surprised the burglars and called the police, while the foreign dark-haired young offenders fled across the roof. He was banned by the top management to say anything, but he told me all about it. Once again someone smashed a massive glass door in the corridor in the evening while I was still working. Again nothing could be found out. In addition, someone tried in the evening to open forcefully the office space of another office building of the company when I was alone in the company with a blind female colleague. As a precaution, I had closed all the staircase and elevator entrances and doors, which saved us. My husband picked me up that evening and noticed suspicious lights above our floor from his car, lights from a floor that was actually empty at the time. Soon after, he saw a whole group of Arab suspicious young men furiously leaving the building. My blind colleague at the time was scared to death, but did not want that I call the police and left the building shivering with me over the elevator, where my husband was already was waiting very worried. In another case someone wanted to break into another office building with my female colleagues in the morning when I was on vacation. Completely hysterical, they called my boss, who forbade them to call the police for their paranoia. It is not surprising that this was my office space. Another time when I was on vacation as well, an elderly colleague unsuspectingly picked up my phone and heard an unknown man yell deadly death threats, including: I punch you in the skull, I'll kill you.
Since the caller called the whole day, the police were informed, which could only find out that the calls were made by a phone booth in Berlin. Everything was to be kept secret from me, yet my colleagues told me everything. Once again I silently talked to our male receptionist about the front desk when an unknown stocky Arab showed up at the glass door, made threatening gestures to us and wildly scolded him in Arabic. When the receptionist wanted to ask him what he was doing there, the culprit fled with a car. A few years after moving out of the tenant, I was twice persecuted in the morning on the way to work in the dark by a male stranger, who always remained in the dark and avoided the streetlights. It was strong male steps and a very big shadow. Did I stop, he stopped, when I went on, he wents on. The same happened twice on the way back, even in the dark in the evening. My husband, who was the meaning it was too dangerous for me, drove me to the tram and picked me up in the evening. About stalking was not spoken in my company. Despite all the incidents, the female persons who reported incidents were accused of paranoia. I was personally told that these are all coincidences that I should not overestimate. Much was also tried to keep secret from me.

I got and receive many phone calls from him with fake names, both professionally and privately. He called himself, for example, Mr. Unterberg, Kofi Annan, Johnny Cash, Johnnie Walker, Jim Beam. He also allegedly called on behalf of our insurance companies, our health insurance or a environment organization, where I was a member. Recalls from my husband and myself showed that no one from the insurance companies, the health insurance and environment organization had called us. He never disguised his voice and always laughed maliciously. I always recognized and identified him. In addition, we received uninterrupted anonymous letters and faxes that our relatives had died abroad. Unfortunately, I was also confronted with sadistic and misogynist pornography by this Muslim ex-tenant and stalker and his Islamist friends, in which they constantly sent me BDSM and shocking cruel gangbang pornos and news, especially by a porn producer from Munich, John Thompson, whose film studio became closed later due to incredible cruelty. My stalker and his friends told me that they would practice my planned rape gangbang as a porn supporter and porn statists with John Thompson. Porn producer, Reinhold B. (64) aka John Thompson expressed his pride in 2012 about his disgusting machinations, even if he had to sit in the court in 2010 for it.
What was filmed in his studios on Leopoldstrasse in the middle of Schwabing is, in fact, far beyond ""normal"" pornography: the films are extremely brutal rape! Women are being abused and humiliated. ""On his website,"" John Thompson ""constantly recruits young women:"" If you pass the casting, you start with 25 euros per hour (for gang rape and sexual torture at it's finest). Many of our models earn $ 1,000 a day. (for lifelong injuries on body and soul) ""What women paid for this gage reads like a horror script in the indictment: Bound women are raped by several men at the same time, they are beaten and spit, they become objects and hot candle wax, they are humiliated and literally pulled through the mud. All disgusting details are shown in close up.
Furthermore, during the stalking, I was confronted with sex trafficking and forced prostitution, in which the stalker and his friends told me that my real place was also in such a flat-rate brothel as, for example, in Fellbach near Stuttgart, here there were female sex slaves for almost nothing money and the women and girls would open their mouths only for blowjobs. Soon after that , various flatrate brothels were closed down for human trafficking and forced prostitution and unworthy conditions, as many girls and women had to spend a day with hundreds of suitors, entire buses of horny and sadistic men arrived to stage brutal gangbangs with young girls. After the perpetrators were convicted and the brothels were closed, it became known to the public that the young women were in poor health due to many untreated infections and injuries. Because of trafficking and pimping in so-called flat-rate brothels, two men and the female brothel chief from Fellbach became their punishment in court. The Stuttgart district court sent the defendants to jail for several years. The public has demanded much longer prison sentences for these criminals. From March 2008 to July 2009, they are said to have employed about 200 women and girls, some of them underaged in four brothels with low flat rates. For 100 to 200 euros , the women would have to spend a day available.
My meaning is, the male police means, that all the women are hysterical and implausible. I think nothing of the thesis that stalker are admirers and are harmless, I think this thesis simply idiotic and stupid and it was probably invented to protect these hate crime.

The unintelligible thing about the whole thing is, all Criminals, Mobbers and Stalkers had spectators, bystanders and helpers and people, which are looking away, also females. How can women and girls in this world be so stupid to be not on their own side?
I have therefore the opinion that the cowardly crimes stalking, bullying and rape are punished as hard as possible and that helpers, bystanders and spectators must be also severely punished.
Bullying and stalking, rape culture should not be more straightforward in the future. In cases where bullying and stalking leads to death or ends with rape, gang rape, sexual torture, murder and suicide, there should be high lifelong imprisonment for all parties, including helpers and spectators.

Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny/Kate Manne (Autor)
Misogyny is a hot topic, yet it's often misunderstood. What is misogyny, exactly? Who deserves to be called a misogynist? How does misogyny contrast with sexism, and why is it prone to persist - or increase - even when sexist gender roles are waning? This book is an exploration of misogyny in public life and politics by the moral philosopher and writer Kate Manne. It argues that misogyny should not be understood primarily in terms of the hatred or hostility some men feel toward all or most women. Rather, it's primarily about controlling, policing, punishing, and exiling the ""bad"" women who challenge male dominance. And it's compatible with rewarding ""the good ones,"" and singling out other women to serve as warnings to those who are out of order. It's also common for women to serve as scapegoats, be burned as witches, and treated as pariahs.
Manne examines recent and current events such as the Isla Vista killings by Elliot Rodger, the case of the convicted serial rapist Daniel Holtzclaw, who preyed on African-American women as a police officer in Oklahoma City, Rush Limbaugh's diatribe against Sandra Fluke, and the ""misogyny speech"" of Julia Gillard, then Prime Minister of Australia, which went viral on YouTube. The book shows how these events, among others, set the stage for the 2016 US presidential election. Not only was the misogyny leveled against Hillary Clinton predictable in both quantity and quality, Manne argues it was predictable that many people would be prepared to forgive and forget regarding Donald Trump's history of sexual assault and harassment. For this, Manne argues, is misogyny's oft-overlooked and equally pernicious underbelly: exonerating or showing ""himpathy"" for the comparatively privileged men who dominate, threaten, and silence women.

Gendertrolling: How Misogyny Went Viral/Karla Mantilla (Autor)

A Brief History of Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice (Brief Histories)/ Jack Holland (Autor)
In this compelling, powerful book, highly respected writer and commentator Jack Holland sets out to answer a daunting question: how do you explain the oppression and brutalization of half the world's population by the other half, throughout history?
The result takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through centuries, continents and civilizations as it looks at both historical and contemporary attitudes to women. Encompassing the Church, witch hunts, sexual theory, Nazism and pro-life campaigners, we arrive at today's developing world, where women are increasingly and disproportionately at risk because of radicalised religious belief, famine, war and disease. Well-informed and researched, highly readable and thought-provoking, this is no outmoded feminist polemic: it's a refreshingly straightforward investigation into an ancient, pervasive and enduring injustice. It deals with the fundamentals of human existence -- sex, love, violence -- that have shaped the lives of humans throughout history.
The answer? It's time to recognize that the treatment of women amounts to nothing less than an abuse of human rights on an unthinkable scale. A Brief History of Misogyny is an important and timely book that will make a long-lasting contribution to the efforts to improve those rights throughout the world.

Misogyny and Media in the Age of Trump (Communicating Gender)/

Beyond Blurred Lines: Rape Culture in Popular Media/Nickie D Phillips (Autor)

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Autor)
Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it‚Äôs no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. And, as Gail Dines shows, today‚Äôs porn is strikingly different from yesterday‚Äôs Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. Proving that porn desensitizes and actually limits our sexual freedom, Dines argues its omnipresence is a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town/Jon Krakauer (Autor)
Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, home to a highly regarded state university whose beloved football team inspires a passionately loyal fan base. Between January 2008 and May 2012, hundreds of students reported sexual assaults to the local police. Few of the cases were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.
In these pages, acclaimed journalist Jon Krakauer investigates a spate of campus rapes that occurred in Missoula over a four-year period. Taking the town as a case study for a crime that is sadly prevalent throughout the nation, Krakauer documents the experiences of five victims: their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the skepticism directed at them by police, prosecutors, and the public; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them. These stories cut through abstract ideological debate about acquaintance rape to demonstrate that it does not happen because women are sending mixed signals or seeking attention. They are victims of a terrible crime, deserving of fairness from our justice system. Rigorously researched, rendered in incisive prose, Missoula stands as an essential call to action.

Fraternity Gang Rape: Sex, Brotherhood, and Privilege on Campus /Peggy Reeves Sanday (Autor)
This widely acclaimed and meticulously documented volume illustrates, in painstaking and disturbing detail, the nature of fraternity gang rape. Drawing on interviews with both victims and fraternity members, Peggy Reeves Sanday reconstructs daily life in the fraternity, highlighting the role played by pornography, male bonding, and degrading, often grotesque, initiation and hazing rituals.
In a substantial new introduction and afterword, Sanday updates the incidences of fraternity gang rape on college campuses today, highlighting such recent cases as that of Duke University and others in the headlines. Sanday also explores the nature of hazing at sororities on campus and how Greek life in general contributes to a culture which promotes the exploitation and sexual degradation of women on campus. More broadly, Sanday examines the nature of campus life today and the possibility of creating a rape-free campus culture.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don‚Äôt Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Autor)
An award-winning journalist's intimate investigation of the true scope of domestic violence, revealing how the roots of America's most pressing social crises are buried in abuse that happens behind closed doors.
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a ‚Äúglobal epidemic.‚Äù In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don't know we're seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths-that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

See What You Made Me Do: Power, Control and Domestic Violence /Jess Hill (Autor)
""Women are abused or killed by their partners at astonishing rates- in Australia, almost 17 per cent of women over the age of fifteen - one in six - have been abused by an intimate partner. In this confronting and deeply researched account, journalist Jess Hill uncovers the ways in which abusers exert control in the darkest - and most intimate - ways imaginable. She asks- What do we know about perpetrators? Why is it so hard to leave? What does successful intervention look like? What emerges is not only a searing investigation of the violence so many women experience, but a dissection of how that violence can be enabled and reinforced by the judicial system we trust to protect us. Combining exhaustive research with riveting storytelling, See What You Made Me Do dismantles the flawed logic of victim-blaming and challenges everything you thought you knew about domestic and family violence.""--Publisher's description.

Stalkers and their Victims /Paul E. Mullen (Autor)
Stalking has moved from being a novel area for study to become a core area of concern for mental health professionals, lawyers and other members of the criminal justice system.

This new edition brings the reader completely up-to-date with the explosion in published research and clinical studies in the field, and covers new issues such as cyberstalking, stalking health professionals, stalking in the workplace, female stalkers, juvenile stalkers, stalking celebrities, evaluating risk in the stalking situation, as well as exploring changes to the legal status of the behaviour. Illustrated with case studies throughout, this is the definitive guide and reference for anyone with professional, academic or other interests in this complex behaviour.

Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online/ Bailey Poland (Autor)
Cybersexism is rampant and can exact an astonishingly high cost. In some cases, the final result is suicide.
Bullying, stalking, and trolling are just the beginning. Extreme examples such as GamerGate get publicized, but otherwise the online abuse of women is largely underreported. Haters combines a history of online sexism with suggestions for solutions.
Using current events and the latest available research into cybersexism, Bailey Poland questions the motivations behind cybersexist activities and explores methods to reduce footprints of Internet misogyny, drawing parallels between online and offline abuse. By exploring the cases of Alyssa Funke, Rehtaeh Parsons, Audrie Pott, Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu, and others, and her personal experiences with sexism, Poland develops a compelling method of combating sexism online.

Domestic Disturbances, Patriarchal Values/ Marianna Muravyeva (Herausgeber)
This book offers an in-depth analysis of several national case studies on family violence between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, using court records as their main source. It raises important questions for research on early modern Europe: the notion of absolute power; sovereignty and its applicability to familial power; the problem of violence and the possibility of its usage for conflict resolution both in public and private spaces; and the interconnection of gender and violence against women, reconsidered in the context of modern state formation as a public sphere and family building as a private sphere.
Contributors bring together detailed studies of domestic violence and spousal murder in Romania, England, and Russia, abduction and forced marriage in Poland, infanticide and violence against parents in Finland, and rape and violence against women in Germany. These case studies serve as the basis for a comparative analysis of forms, models, and patterns of violence within the family in the context of debates on political power, absolutism, and violence. They highlight changes towards unlimited violence by family patriarchs in European countries, in the context of the changing relationship between the state and its citizens. This book was originally published as a special issue of the Journal of the History of the Family.

Mass Rape: The War against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina/ Alexandra Stiglmayer (Herausgeber), Roy Gutman (K√ºnstler), Marion Faber (√úbersetzer)
Alexandra Stiglmayer interviewed survivors of the continuing war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to reveal, to a seemingly deaf world, the horrors of the ongoing war in the former Yugoslavia. The women¬óprimarily of Muslim but also of Croatian and Serbian origin¬óhave endured the atrocities of rape and the loss of loved ones. Their testimony, published in the 1993 German edition, is bare, direct, and its cumulative effect overwhelming.
The first English edition contains Stiglmayer's updates to her own two essays, one detailing the historical context of the current conflict and the other presenting the core of the book, interviews with some twenty victims of rape as well as interviews with three Serbian perpetrators. Essays investi-gating mass rape and war from ethnopsychological, sociological, cultural, and medical perspectives are included.
New essays by Catharine A. MacKinnon, Rhonda Copelon, and Susan Brownmiller address the crucial issues of recognizing the human rights of women and children. A foreword by Roy Gutman describes war crimes within the context of the UN Tribunal, and an afterword by Cynthia Enloe relates the mass rapes of this war to developments and reactions in the international women's movement.
Accounts of torture, murder, mutilation, abduction, sexual enslavement, and systematic attempts to impregnate¬óall in the name of ""ethnic cleansing""¬ómake for the grimmest of reading. However brutal and appalling the information conveyed here, this book cannot and should not be ignored.

Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment/ Linda Hirshman (Autor)
The first history‚Äîincisive, witty, fascinating‚Äîof the fight against sexual harassment, from the author of the New York Times bestseller Sisters in Law
Linda Hirshman, acclaimed historian of social movements, delivers the sweeping story of the struggle leading up to #MeToo and beyond: from the first tales of workplace harassment percolating to the surface in the 1970s, to the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal‚Äîwhen liberal women largely forgave Clinton, giving men a free pass for two decades. Many liberals even resisted the movement to end rape on campus.
And yet, legal, political, and cultural efforts, often spearheaded by women of color, were quietly paving the way for the takedown of abusers and harassers. Reckoning delivers the stirring tale of a movement catching fire as pioneering women in the media exposed the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, women flooded the political landscape, and the walls of male privilege finally began to crack. This is revelatory, essential social history.

The Accuser: The True Story of the Big Dan's Gang Rape Victim/ Karen Curtis (Author)
Cheryl Ann Araujo is The Accuser. In 1983, she was victimized by men, the judicial system, the Government, the media, and the Portuguese mob because she stood up against them all in the Big Dan's rape trial in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
In 1988, Jodie Foster portrayed a character loosely based on Cheryl Araujo in the Hollywood movie The Accused for which she won an Academy Award. Foster's character was gang raped on a pinball machine, rather than a pool table.
But, by the time the movie was released Cheryl was already dead. After the rape trials, she was run out of Massachusetts due to death threats and in 1986, died in a single-car accident in South Florida. Her two young daughters were with her in the car and survived. They recall what happened that fateful day in this book.
This is the true story about what the government and Hollywood do not want you to know regarding one young woman's fight as an accuser to tell her true story to a jury and to the world without being ""victim blamed."" Cheryl was one of the first accusers to face a camera in the courtroom shaping the way the media and judicial system covers rape trials today. Her grueling experience also planted the first seeds of today's burgeoning #MeToo movement.
The book contains never before published information, interviews, and photographs about the life and death of Cheryl Araujo, one of the most tragic accusers and heroines in American history.

Burned Alive: A Survivor of an ""Honor Killing"" Speaks Out/Souad (Author) Marie-Therese Cuny (Collaborator)
When Souad was seventeen she fell in love. In her West Bank village, as in so many others, sex before marriage is considered a grave dishonor to one's family and is punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of meting out her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family's clothes, he poured gasoline over her and set her on fire. Miraculously, she survived, rescued by women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horribly burned over seventy percent of her body and still denounced by her family, Souad was able to receive the care she needed only after the intervention of a European aid worker. Now in permanent exile from her homeland, she has decided to tell her story and reveal the barbarity of a practice that continues to this day. Burned Alive ...is the first true account ever published by a victim of an ""honor crime."" Souad's inspiring testimony is a shocking, moving, and harrowing story of cruelty and incomparable courage...and an inspiring call to action to end a heinous tradition.

Being Reshma: The Extraordinary Story of an Acid-Attack Survivor who Took the World by Storm/ Reshma Qureshi (Author), Tania Singh (Author)
On 19 May 2014, as seventeen-year-old Reshma Qureshi left home for the examination centre, everything happened in a flash. The men rushed towards her. Grabbed her. Tugged at her hair. Poured acid on her face. Soon she started to burn like a living corpse. The acid ate through her skin and aimed for her bones, but it could not quell the fire in her heart. Rising from from tragedy and suffering, Reshma soon made global headlines by becoming the first acid-attack survivor to walk the runway at the New York Fashion Week. Now an international anti-acid-sale activist, vlogger, model, and the face of Make Love Not Scars, Reshma works tirelessly towards empowering other acid-attack survivors like herself and has become a beacon of hope for millions. Inspiring and life-affirming, Being Reshma is the extraordinary story of this young girl from the slums of Mumbai, who overcame insurmountable odds in an unjust world and dared to change it.",0,0,Event,20197947,0,comment,2020-11-09T09:23:26Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],20197947,20197947,Stop abusing men in any way!,2020-02-06T07:37:18Z,,2020-02-06T07:38:49Z,,en-US,['en'],United Nations Human Rights Council: Stop abusing men in any way!,"<p>‚Å∏Women are great, because they're the ones who brought us to see the beauty of world.

They were there everytime we need someone to talk to. But what most people don't see is men, or fathers. Women are not the only ones who created us. Without men, we wouldn't be here either. People often just acknowledge women for everything, and sometimes, when there's a violence committed in a marriage, they always assume that it's the husband who's at fault. They don't ask both sides anymore because they think men are dominant enough to hurt women. But that's not always the case. Let's take a look at Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Depp lost his prized role in Pirates of the Caribbean being Capt. Jack Sparrow because of the false accusations Heard said and the world believed her because she's a woman. She really made it clear that Depp is the one who's really violent. But the truth is, it's actually her. In a 2015 taped two-hour therapy session, Aquaman actress Heard, 33, is heard talking to actor Depp, then her husband, about their strained relationship, admitting that she hit him, and had previously threw pots and pans (TheStar, 2020).
