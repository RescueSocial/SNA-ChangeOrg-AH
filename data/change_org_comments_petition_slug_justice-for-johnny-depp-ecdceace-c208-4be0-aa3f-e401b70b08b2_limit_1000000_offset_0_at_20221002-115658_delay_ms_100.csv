<p>The unfathomable acts of Amber Heard is just more proof of exactly the monster Johnny is up against. Amber repeatedly and secretly recorded their arguments where Johnny was especially upset, she used narcissistic and gaslighting tactics constantly, she even prevented Johnny from leaving, basically holding him against his will (forcible confinement) and the most bizarre of all, she took a sh*t on HIS side of the bed before leaving to Coachella for 2 days.</p>
