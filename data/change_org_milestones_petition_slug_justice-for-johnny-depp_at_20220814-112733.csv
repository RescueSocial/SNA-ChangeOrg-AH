StarterPetitionUpdate,25748930,2020-02-14T03:31:26.000Z,,Update.... Need your help!,"<p>I still have not heard any news as to Disney giving in and giving Depp his role back as Sparrow. Please keep signing and sharing as much as possible, we can make a difference if we continue to get people to sign.</p>
<p>I am posting this new update because Amber Heard just got signed to a new contract with L'Oréal Paris and that literally makes no sense. This woman should not be gaining any new contracts until she pays for what she has done to Depp.</p>
<p>I created a new petition as well to have her removed from that L'Oréal contract. Please take time to go check it out and sign that petition so that we can continue as a whole to bring justice to Depp in any way that we can.</p>
<p>Please don’t stop sharing, and don’t give up on Depp!</p>
<p>The new petition is called Remove Amber Heard from L'Oréal Contract, I also attached a half picture so that you all will know what the petition looks like.</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance!</p>
