StarterPetitionUpdate,22053795,2017-11-23T16:08:19.000Z,Visa Granted!!!!,"Well after 9 months and 2 weeks, finally the Home Office decided my application on November 13th. I've found out by calling them on November 14th. Monday November 20th got an email that a decision was made, and my passport arrived with the Visa inside Tuesday 21st.
I doubt that it happened because of this petition...but I had to kick off somehow...
Thank you all for your love and support.
Happiest girl in the world now! I'll be joining my husband real soon.
Thank you very much.",,,,
