He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Walt Disney Sudiosshould and must not consider Heard for their Tangled film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF PERSON WE NEED OUR CHILDREN LOOKING UP TO AS A ROLE MODEL��</p>

Some of my shocking experiences with patriarchy:.
I was stalked and hunted for two years (1963-1965, Stöckenhof, Welzheimer Wald) with a car by a   cowardly pervert as I was a little school girl on my long and lonley school way. In the beginning I was 8 years old. He hunted me for 2 years and once in the back of his car, so I can see it, he had a notebook with female nude photos.The last time the man chased me with the car and tried to pull me in the car, I called him very angry a asshole, I slammed the car door from the outside and clamped his arm in the car door and then I ran away over fields, fields,scrub where he could not follow with the car. He called me a little slut and whore and threatened to kill me. Nevertheless, this behavior has saved me. Although the offender was tall and strong, I escaped. Then I was telling everything to my teacher and classmates which were trying to ambush the man to grab him to another time. But he escaped. and was never seen again. He had still unsuccessfully addressed boys of my age in the village, but he had not hunted them like me.  This confirms my suspicion that pornography contributes to sexual violence. And these boys have noticed that he had an strange  license plate and a case for traveling salesmen in the backseat. That said, this man was probably nationwide on the road and in my view, he could certainly have raped and killed children everywhere on his trips. No one could have proved it to him then, the DNA search did not exist at that time.
 
As I now know today with almost 100 percent certainty, I met the notorious child murderer and child molester Erich Dietrich at that time. At his trial in Stuttgart in 1968, where he was sentenced to two life sentences at the age of 41, I recognized him in the newspaper. My grandma took the newspaper away from me and said that I would imagine that, I was never followed by Erich Dietrich, that was a different weirdo and I shouldn't tell anyone about it. I have never forgotten Erich Dietrich's face, the deep wrinkles on the cheeks, the flickering, lurking gaze and when I looked at my pursuer I saw a skull instead of a face. This monster confessed to two murders to the police after his last murder, but everyone agreed at the time that he probably had more victims on his conscience in the whole of Swabia, especially in the Stuttgart area. Since only two children's corpses could be attributed to him as perpetrators and the police, forensics and investigations in Germany were in their infancy in the 1960s, only two child murders could be proven. But experts are still certain that more children who have disappeared in kindergarten and elementary school are due to him. Only recently came another media report about Erich Dietrich and I recognized him immediately, even though there was a bar over his eyes. The following was reported 1968: It was about the murder on Christmas Eve 1966 of seven-year-old Hannelore Eibl. After the crime, the perpetrator Erich Dietrich reported to the police in Stuttgart and it gradually became clear that he had also killed the seven-year-old Sybille Frank, who disappeared on May 20, 1964. Erich Dietrich  raped bestial these two girls and murdered them very cruelly. He got twice life sentences for it. He had lived his life behind prison walls from early childhood and it had taken years for the aggression to discharge. A psychopath but fully responsible for what he did. Since I was as litllte child busy running away, the information about the car description and the perpetrator came from other children who had also been approached in our village. But these little boys and elementary school students were also unfamiliar with cars and license plates, so it was unclear which town or municipality the perpetrator came from. It was only clear, that this man wasn't from here. The indifference of adults led to at least two murders of girls, from my point of view there were certainly more. There were a lot of missing children back then. Since I met him for the first time in 1963 and the last time in 1965, all murders could have been prevented. What a perverse human pig!
 
I was bullied and stalked in college (Higher business school 1972-1973) and at workplace (Telecommunications Office Stuttgart-Feuerbach and Telecommunications Construction District Fellbach , 1973-1976).
At the Higher business school in Backnang I was 17 year old. I got rape threats from a psychopathic classmate (a cowardly idiot).
The classmate was an absolutely spoiled son and sexist idiot, Raimund Fritz, of an innkeeper in Sulzbach an der Murr. When the classmate sexually insulted and scolded me in front of the whole class, I ripped him with his long hair over a bench and hit him with a ruler until it broke. That gave me respect, because he was a very strong and very tall young man.
I also found it outrageous that he always blocked my way with his chair when I was supposed to pick up my class work from the teacher at the front, and sometimes he even stamped against my foot. Once it was too stupid for me and I kicked his chair and that of his arrogant neighbor, who was constantly stealing sandwiches and drinks from me and my female friend with this class idiot and sometimes half eaten and contaminated the drinks with urine and then throw it back in our school bags. The two fell right at the feet of the arrogant and also misogynistic class teacher (the two had the applause of this sexist bastard), who constantly made misogynistic and sexist comments in class.. So I said, now you know how a gentleman should behave towards a lady. The three machos were speechless and the class roared with laughter. Only something like that is not laughable or ..
The mad idiot had many girl friends all the time, changing them like T-Shirts and laughing about them and called them sluts and whores, but in spite of that, he harassed me. It was his morning sport, throwing his heavy backpack filled with books at my head. Some girls thought it was funny, but had he, as athletic and huge as he was, only met my head once, I would have been a case for the hospital with severe head injuries. Nobody intervened here. While I was on sick leave twice towards the end of school, my two best female friends disappeared from class and I could no longer reach them by the telephone. They let us all know that they didn't want to see or hear any more from the class, not even from me. What has happened there? Nobody in the class wanted to tell me what happened, only to the point that my mentally disturbed classmate would have verbally insulted them in front of the class. Towards the end of the school year, a class party was planned in a forest cottage, to which female classmates should entice me. In reality, two classmates warned me that this was where my group rape by my harassing classmate and his friends was planned to taking place. I'm not one of those stupid people who go to parties like this.
Three Classmates and a female teacher were speaking some hard words to him, after I told them, that this stalker want to rape me with others and was planing that. He defamed me in the whole school and called me a mad slut. This classmate, of course, was also a fan of misogynistic sex films like Clockwerk Orange and The Last Tango of Paris, and proclaimed daily that this was the way women should be treated. So do you seriously believe that such films are harmless? What a heinous human pig! He left the school without passed exame. On a rainy night (I had already left school after passing the exam) he beheaded all the flowers and roses below my bedroom window and trampled all the beds in the garden with his very large shoes. The tracks could be seen the next morning. He made telephone terror together with other unknown guys for many years and drifted around the house at night. Destroyed all the flowers under my bedroom window on the ground floor at night and always showed with threatening looks at my station.The harassment continued after the exam ended. Again and again I met my ex-classmate at the train station at my place of residence or work or at the bus stop. Several times he combed the train with friends on which I was going home and they gave me angry looks because I was sitting in the compartment with two female colleagues and they couldn't do anything. Another time, a classmate who was supporting him sat down next to me in the authorities canteen, which could also be used by other employees, and gave me suggestive looks, he probably wanted to ruin my appetite for the meal, but I kept silent and continued eating. Once they caught me in the building of the main train station and threw an umbrella from behind into my back, that was too powerful and and the umbrella broke, after which they ran away laughing. And such people are still protected by everyone, because boys are boys, I think they are all crazy who help such people.
 
At the workplace there was a rape attempt by a male boss Alois Monz, Telecommunications building district  Stuttgart (a cowardly dumb ass)I was 18 years old in 1974. At that time I had a limited internship in the building district of the German Federal Post Office in Fellbach. And here  and in Telecommunications office in Stuttgart Feuerbach was daily sexual harassment on the agenda and I was one of the very young and mostly underaged victims. But as later a female supervisor (It was said, don't ask yourself who the wild Marga Wild slept with, you'd better ask who she hasn't slept with on this planet yet) told me, I would be a shame for the whole post office because men are men, but my behavior to openly blame these men cannot be excused. I have not heard a greater nonsense in my life. I was asking her in rage, "" is this a brothel or a firm?"". She never forgave me for that, and neither does any of the other silly women sleeping around.
The case was this one; 1974 one afternoon my young supervisor Alois Monz (this idiot acted like a boss, but  he wasn't one)  gave me a lot of work unnecessarily, so I sat at it until the evening. When we were alone in the office, he came from behind, took me into a strangle hold and tried to throw me down and take off the sweater. I broke free with elbows and kicks, gave him a chin hook that sent him to the ground and then stepped on him. After that, I escaped. I was very angry because his pregnant wife was in the hospital and he bragged in the office, that he slept daily with another girl, they are all sluts and bitches. This offender was very strong, like a bulldog.The sex offender had a porn calendar in the office with really bad porn from young girls and when I complained about the porn calendar, it was laughed about by the men in that office and by the only two female employees (very stupid bitches, I think). Does a porn calendar belong to the workplace and who is still surprised if I was  a victim of attempted rape there,  I was not very surprised?
And the sex film School Girl Report in Germany  at that time was really bad, which offered these sex offenders in the company the excuse to sexually harass girls, because according to the film, young girls are permanently horny ... Unfortunately, these films still exist today, because sex and porn films do not collect dust anywhere. I told everything to my other big boss and a very young male collegague. Both said very hard words to the culprit and threatend him with the police. This wanker said, he invited me to a cup of coffee and then I got mad. And to others he said that I was a liar and a slut sleeping around. What a cowardly human pig! My boss said, I must keep silence about that to keep my job. Great or not...The good meassage is, they did not believe him, the bad message is, they did nothing against him and that was the end of my career. In spite of this I was bullied and harassed by others, because of that and so I terminated my job after three years for a better one.And in my entire professional life until my retirement I had no more problems like I had with the state company, that disgusting company with all these male pigs.
It was absolutely outrageous on the part of my female boss Marga Wild at the time to call me a disgrace for the telecommunications office instead of the sex offenders being held accountable. I answered her whether it was an authority or a brothel, everyone there thought it was outrageous, but it was the truth. Many girls, who started with me or later, quit crying after their parents who protested against the harassment were laughed at and they themselves were described as hysterical liars. I was one of many victims of harassment and even the works council was participated in the harassment. When I went in my desperation the deputy works council who had a daughter in my age and I urgently asked for a transfer to another department because of the constant harassment, this jerk offered me his supposed huge penis, he said that this solved my obvious problem and I ran out of the office and had one more enemy.
Two friends of my husband, completely stupid tail bearers, who also worked at the post office without his knowledge, said in response to his complaints about the evil harrassment in my office that something like me should be thrown out of the office immediately, because I probably don't know where my place as a woman is and a person like me would be an imposition for all the decent men in this office and I would be a disgrace to the authority . That was the end of the friendship. In meetings before, they were extremely aggressive and rude towards me, what makes my fiancé speechless, but light came in the darkness, because my mother-in-law found out where they worked and then my husband tried to talk to his longtime friends and that was the result. Shameful for the office, shameful for the alleged non-friends.
I also remember that the hiring manager was bullied away by a lover ,Mr. Albrecht,  of my female boss Marga Wild, who was bullying me and many other young girls and women and then this misogynist idiot took the place of the kind personnel manager. He always had me temporarily transferred to other departments and branches as a substitute, where other lovers of my female boss were working as superiors. They also bullied me and gave me the judgment that I was very difficult, but that I would do my job well. In other words, not good for fucking, but good for working.
This HR  Mr. Albrecht manager (so with such a disgusting fool you can deeply regret all the women around him)  had me come to his office several times in the three years and verbally insulting me that I should be happy to be able to work there and must show more submission as a woman, otherwise he would make sure that I never got a job anywhere with the state again (my answer was always to him, if there is anything else against me, just don't force yourself to hold it back, it will lead to depression and he was very angry every time, because he usually made all female colleagues cry within 5 minutes ). Unfortunately, after my resignation after the time in this firm (1973-1976), it was precisely the case that, due to the character assassination of the personnel department, no authority wanted to hire me anymore. So I learned my dream job as a publishing clerk and was much happier with it.
 
I'm still stalked to this day  and harassed by an misogynist Muslim ex-tenant, Adis Fazlic, Melbourne (this completely stupid tail bearer sometimes living in Bosnia, Austria, Germany, there in Bavaria and Hesse, so he told my husband during the rent time,  a cowardly asshole and sadistic women hater) and his entire circle of friends for 17 years (2004-2021). At the beginning time I was 48 years old.
My case will show that if you have a damn bad feeling about people, that feeling is right. In 2004, shortly before my hospital stay (I was in great pain and had to undergo an operation as soon as possible), my husband was looking for a new tenant for our student apartment. As always, he put up an apartment advertisement in the local student cafeteria several times. We noticed that this ad was constantly being torn down and calls were coming in daily from foreign men asking whether the apartment was still vacant. That was scary to me. My tenant at the time also called and was particularly pushy. I warned my husband about renting out to these people, especially since we had a damn terrorist problem in the country at the time, several mosques were under surveillance. Unfortunately, my husband didn't listen to me and rented it out to the caller who struck me as the scariest. That had bad consequences.
 
There were damages to property, slander on the Internet, cybermobbing, telephone terror, rape threats and death threats during and after the rent period. I got many sadistic rape porns and I was called a slut, which deserves rape. My husband e-mailed the tenant for his outrageous behavior after the rent time of 3,5 months, Adis Fazlic, a very tall and athletic type, with extremely ugly and large paws and feets,  (he told my husband, that he was a student of the Swinbourne University in Melbourne and that he was working for 6 months for the famous firm Bosch in Stuttgart-Feuerbach) then accused us of being liars and stalkers.
My husband noticed very quickly at the beginning at the rent period that this Muslim was just pretending to be open-minded and modern. I once came to a discussion at the beginning of the rent time between my husband and the tenant about why many women in Islam have to wear headscarves and burqas and the ex-tenant said he had a modern opinion on this, but by women there simply have to apply different standards to men, the same is not the same.
I said quickly, I agree, I am also in favor of wearing burqas for men, because it's unbearable how these poor men are attacked by women every day, isn't it?
You should have seen the murderous look of this oh-so-modern Muslim, no trace of humor!
My husband reported the tenant on suspicion of terrorism  after the rent time because tenant had the behavior of a terrorist and friendships with very uncanny appropriate  and islamic people.
Our ex-tenant told us  during the rent time that he was a student of the University of Melbourne and would do an internship at a famous firm in Stuttgart. At the time, I wondered why the university and the firm did not realize which real psychopath they were dealing with.
I think my ex-tenant is a very narcisstic man who is capable of anything. Shortly before moving out, he was seen laughing and taking a pistol at the head of his then-female acquaintance (a Muslim girl friend for some weeks) in a car below the house. At the same time, my husband informed me that the tenant had bought a  very sadistic porn on the same day, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleeding from me (I have always been of the lifelong opinion that misogynistic and sadistic pornography promotes misogyny and has nothing to do with the sexual liberation of women, but with the liberation of men from barriers to sexual violence in a completely legal manner).
It was clear to my husband.  what had happened. After that day the girl left the apartmant for ever. During his short thenant-time he had a girl friend and many One-Night-Stands, but in spite of that, he stalked me. And he defamed me in the neighbour hood as woman, that slept around. After the departure of the tenant informed me the very worried mother of a female tenant in the apartment above him that her daugther was probably drugged with drugs, raped and was now blackmailed. The mother of the female tenant must give her 24.000 €, the daughter said, she had to pay someone at once. But she said her mother not, who he was. Since the female tenant no longer talked to us and then moved out and probably no police turned on, we could unfortunately do nothing.
 
Anonymous murder and rape threats to me were signed with Jack from Hell. I got a photo sent from the blowjob with about a twelve years old girl or younger, I recognized him on the liver spot and dimples on the chin, on the dark hair and the clothes. And I got anonymous many rape porns with E-Mail with calling me a dumb bitch and prostitute.
From a forum for stalking victims, I and all those who wanted to help me, were bullied out by him and other unknowns within a few days. I was no longer anonymous, because my appearance and my place of residence was described. A pen pal discovered a Bosnian forum where my tenant bragged that he was going to end the conflict with a woman with a bottle in her vagina, attached with a corresponding cruel X-ray image of such a crime. What a sadistic human pig! My tenant was a very tall and very strong man, when I realized that he was planning at the end of the rent time something evil (I have damn good premonitions about these things )when I was home alone one day, I invited my parents and let them park their car somewhere else. He came then and was very, very angry when I was not alone, he was sweating heavily, claiming that he wanted to pay me the rent cash today and pulled out a bundle of unbelievable many money , which seemed very strange to me.  Today I think, it was the money of my blackmailed female tenant. Believe me, he is a big psychopathic liar, and capable of anything that I know to be evil.
There are also frequent incidents (during the rental period and even today after removal of the tenant) with nocturnal shots below the house, nocturnal destruction of a flower bank, flower pots, outdoor lamps, outdoor cameras, motion detectors, garden furniture in the garden, digging plants and stone steps at night Removal of the garbage containers or paper containers at night with removal of the contents, nightly damage to the company car (scratching, loosening the wheel nuts, piercing the tires).And until now we hear unknown men nightly around the house, under the house and the garden. A girlfriend of mine saw unknown foreign men in cars under the house nightly together with her friend, these people were driving always quickly away when they saw my girlfriend and her friend. Apart from the fact that he did not even pay his monthly newspaper and told the newspaper I would pay it.  We couldn't clear that with this man after the rent time.
Again and again, someone unknown goes around the house at night. When I threw hard fruit out of the skylight several times a night and hit the shadow, I heard from the sounds that it was a man.
Since my ex-tenant had intercepted mail from me during his tenancy and spied constantly in the paper container at night in discarded postal items, he came so to the addresses of girlfriends, penpals and colleagues.
These people were massively harassed on the Internet and privately with telephone terror, property damages, break-ins and burglary attempts. A female friend of mine, who lived below my house in Stuttgart, was harassed by a whole unknown Arab clique (there were a burglary attempt and rape threats connected with harassment and telephone terror) until she threatened with the police. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, I saw this man again and again at longer intervals nearby, near the house, in the tram, the tram stop in my neighborhood, my workplace, near my girlfriend's apartment, either alone or together with an unknown man or an unknown woman, either in changing cars with different license plates or without a car. With beard, glasses, sunglasses or without. My son also saw him differently in the car parks near his school. When I saw him once in front of the shopping center of our district in the morning, my imitated photos were gone for 6 weeks. On a vacation and a cure, I had an unknown very big man at night on the balcony, which was also noticed by others. In addition, we had two private burglary attempts and a break-in attempt in our Austrian apartment and in a cure tried at night an unknown man to invade in my room. When a movie theater we visited, had to be evacuated because of a decaying, stinking dead animal that unknown people had left behind us, my son and his friend saw our ex-tenant with an unknown woman leaving the cinema. In addition, the ex-tenant repeatedly called me with false identities professionally and privately, so in the presence of my son in December 2015, when I was just was released from a serious tumor surgery from the hospital, my ex-tenant called himself Mr. Unterberg. At the hospital last night, an unknown tall, dark-haired man tried to get into my room, but he was expelled by a fellow female patient. The daughter of a female friend (who herself was exposed to several burglaries and harassment from a group of unknown foreign persons), was gangraped by unknown perpetrators and made a severely disabled. The perpetrators were never identified. The stalking of another girlfriend (Burglaries, harassment by unknown) was so extreme that she goes with her husband many times to the police, but the police could not find out everything, in all other cases it was the same.
 
I found the incidents during my hospital stay at the beginning of the rental period very bad. I can tell you, I had more than enough of this fool back then. First of all, the guy showed up every day at my husband's house under pretexts. Then the post and address lists disappeared from me in the meantime and secondly, this guy always went up and down in front of my hospital smoking in the evening, clearly visible from my window. I already knew then that I had a bloody problem. The missing letters and address lists did not come to light until much later, because at first my husband thought he had misplaced everything because he is very distracted. Unfortunately, this was not the case, because from this point onwards everyone who had sent me letters or was on the address lists was harassed. And unfortunately at that time my husband had given the tenant our computer, who pretended to be an IT expert and was working for some months at a famous Stuttgart company and wanted to make the computer run faster. In reality, we then had spyware and Trojans on it for years and from now on we got loads of virus and porn mails, both professionally and privately. For years, my husband's acquaintances who were IT professionals had to clean up this crap. And secondly, I saw this man walking up and down in front of the hospital every evening from my window, smoking, and knew that, since I was a member of a victim protection organization that also looked after victims of stalking, I had a bloody problem. And I no longer felt safe in the hospital. That wasn't fun.
 
Even on my first vacation in the Allgäu after this mad man has left his apartment, I did not find the many anonymous love messages on my mobile phone funny, nor did I find the unknown man on my balcony at night very amusing. It also bothered my parents, who were there with my son on this vacation in 2004. On my return we found a kangaroo postcard from the tenant to my son in the mailbox. The card was not postmarked and had no postage and was supposed to prove that he was in Australia. No comment .. I didn't find it funny either, after an email from unknown with hello my angel, how are you,  was not answered by me 2006, that my son’s school was set on fire and burned down by an unknown that same night. Do you think that's funny?
After the rental period, things really got going bad, two female ex-colleagues received obscene calls, and one of them had the problem that the house's mailboxes was damaged for weeks. Another good elderly female friend also got obscene calls and someone always rang the doorbell at night. All my e-mail friends, whether abroad or not, received virus and porn mails, including my direct female colleagues; these e-mails were often sent with my faked e-mail address. A female Canadian friend and a female English friend,  were bullied  out together with me with nasty porn and rape messages from social networks two days after they invited me to these networks in 2005. At that time, data protection was not so prevail as it is today, the photos were uploaded with place of residence. The Canadian female friend was then stalked and had constant break-ins, her daughter was probably the victim of a contract group rape in 2010 (we thought so at that time)  in England, because at the time of the rape in 2010 there was played a rape on my phone. As it later turned out, this wasn't a joke. The Austrian female pen friend who had sent me letters at the time was also stalked afterwards, had many break-ins (2006-2013)  and her mother's dog was stolen and they were mocked on the phone that they did not deserve this dog. Unfortunately, that was still not all.
Because in the meantime I always got calls from the ex-tenant under a false name. In one case he called me in 2008 as an alleged employee of an environmental protection organization, asking me, why I would have there resigned and now would be in a women's organization, what would I think of? How did he know that, no idea, stalkers know a lot ...
At that time he was in top form, because when I wanted to go to the local harbor festival  in 2008 with a female friend a little time later, he called me on the phone at the moment I wanted to go out the door, saying, he wished me a lot of fun at the harbor festival, he would be sure that I am would later still think of him. At first I said nothing to my female friend, then when she called the next morning that the cars of her and her daughter, a university student,  had been scratched by unknown people that night, I told her everything. I assumed the university student knew a friend of the stalker's and this person started this action, because men have to stick together, or not ... There is a toxic masculinity and brotherhood here that prevents such offenders from being punished or caught. That includes the police because in all of these cases they have been informed and have done nothing and found nothing. Incredible, but that's how it is!
 
I also found the processes during my rehabilitation cures in Hesse in 2007 and in the Black Forest in 2012 to be absolutely vicious. In Hesse twice at night a very large stranger in a hooded jacket tried to come into the room through my balcony. My balcony was always full of cigarette butts afterwards. Some male cure guests complained to the cure management because they had heard the nocturnal noise, I also complained. Unsuccessful, the cure management said that switching on the police would damage the facility. Very funny...
During my cure in the Black Forest in 2012, a man broke into the building at night using the elevator and tried to pry open my door, but he did not succeed. A single cigarette lay outside the door of my room. Neither I nor the women who lived below and heard the noise could reach anyone by phone. The next morning we didn't even have the chance to report anything to the cure management, they said, we would have overreacted and someone would have made a mistake in the door. Also very funny or ...
How I told it before, in 2004 on a vacation in the Allgäu with my parents and my little son, a tall, dark-haired man tried to break into my balcony at night, unsuccessfully. I saw him more closely because light fell on him. As the smoking balcony was right next to my room, the hotel staff said the next morning that someone here might have stepped onto my balcony just for fun. I just couldn't laugh about it. My parents said I shouldn't make such a fuss, otherwise they would never be able to vacation again as regular guests at this hotel. I got annoying love messages on my mobile phone during the whole vacation and my complaint to the mobile phone provider in the Allgäu was taken seriously, but the provider could not find the caller and SMS sender. After our return my son had a kangaroo postcard without a postage from the tenant in the mailbox. Also very funny or ..
The same happened to us with the holiday apartment in Austria, Carinthia in 2006, where at night someone tried to break into the holiday home with several apartments, strangely enough, only to break into our apartment via the door, also unsuccessfully. When I complained at the front desk, they said not to make such a fuss, someone was wrong about the door. But there were a hell of a lot of cigarette butts under the garden bench in front of our bedroom window, this someone stayed there for a long time. Very funny again ...
 
Of course, all stalking operations also affected my commute and my workplace and all our office buildings. In the long time of stalking, I changed the departments several times and so did the buildings. Shortly after moving out of the ex-tenant we got a lot of virus mails, porno mails, funny and anonymous calls in the company. In addition, there were burglary attempts at my former workplace. But that was not all, as I later moved within the city in another company building, it started really. Burglaries and attempted burglaries were the order of the day in both company buildings, but our superiors made sure that nothing came out. In one case I was on vacation when all the offices were robbed and devastated, except my office and direct colleagues, which all found damn suspicious. Previously, I had noticed suspicious Arabs in the building who did not belong here, and on my report, my boss suspected me of racism. A little later, in the evening, my chief boss in another company building surprised the burglars and called the police, while the foreign dark-haired young offenders fled across the roof. He was banned by the top management to say anything, but he told me all about it. Once again someone smashed a massive glass door in the corridor in the evening while I was still working. Again nothing could be found out. In addition, someone tried in the evening to open forcefully the office space of another office building of the company when I was alone in the company with a blind female colleague. As a precaution, I had closed all the staircase and elevator entrances and doors, which saved us. My husband picked me up that evening and noticed suspicious lights above our floor from his car, lights from a floor that was actually empty at the time. Soon after, he saw a whole group of Arab suspicious young men furiously leaving the building. My blind colleague at the time was scared to death, but did not want that I call the police and left the building shivering with me over the elevator, where my husband was already was waiting very worried. In another case someone wanted to break into another office building with my female colleagues in the morning when I was on vacation. Completely hysterical, they called my boss, who forbade them to call the police for their paranoia. It is not surprising that this was my office space. Another time when I was on vacation as well, an elderly colleague unsuspectingly picked up my phone and heard an unknown man yell deadly death threats, including: I punch you in the skull, I'll kill you.
Since the caller called the whole day, the police were informed, which could only find out that the calls were made by a phone booth in Berlin. Everything was to be kept secret from me, yet my colleagues told me everything. Once again I silently talked to our male receptionist about the front desk when an unknown stocky Arab showed up at the glass door, made threatening gestures to us and wildly scolded him in Arabic. When the receptionist wanted to ask him what he was doing there, the culprit fled with a car. A few years after moving out of the tenant, I was twice persecuted in the morning on the way to work in the dark by a male stranger, who always remained in the dark and avoided the streetlights. It was strong male steps and a very big shadow. Did I stop, he stopped, when I went on, he wents on. The same happened twice on the way back, even in the dark in the evening. My husband, who was the meaning it was too dangerous for me, drove me to the tram and picked me up in the evening.
About stalking was not spoken in my company. Despite all the incidents, the female persons who reported incidents were accused of paranoia. I was personally told that these are all coincidences that I should not overestimate. Much was also tried to keep secret from me.
 
I got and receive many phone calls from him with fake names, both professionally and privately. He called himself, for example, Mr. Unterberg, Kofi Annan, Johnny Cash, Johnnie Walker, Jim Beam. He also allegedly called on behalf of our insurance companies, our health insurance or a environment organization, where I was a member. Recalls from my husband and myself showed that no one from the insurance companies, the health insurance and environment organization had called us. He never disguised his voice and always laughed maliciously. I always recognized and identified him. In addition, we received uninterrupted anonymous letters and faxes that our relatives had died abroad.
It is also a mystery why my over-curious neighbors here never wanted to have noticed what was happening. You're just too cowardly to report anything to the police.
At the beginning I filed a complaint against unknown people, whereby my ex-tenant immediately appeared very suspicious to the police officer in question, but I said I couldn't give the name as long as he was not caught directly, otherwise I could be sued for defamation. At that time there was still no stalking law in Germany and here as a victim you were walking on damn thin ice. Even with the law it is still the same.
 I was also confronted with E-Mail rape threats, signed with Jack from Hell (like Jack the Ripper), sadistic and misogynist pornography by this Muslim ex-tenant and stalker and his Islamist friends, in which they constantly sent me BDSM and shocking cruel gangbang pornos and news, especially by a porn producer from Munich, John Thompson, whose film studio became closed later due to incredible cruelty. My stalker and his friends told me that they would practice my planned rape gangbang as a porn supporter and porn statists with John Thompson. Porn producer, Reinhold B. (64) aka John Thompson expressed his pride in 2012 about his disgusting machinations, even if he had to sit in the court in 2010 for it. He got a fine to pay 75.000,-- €.  What was filmed in his studios on Leopoldstrasse in the middle of Schwabing is, in fact, far beyond ""normal"" pornography: the films are extremely brutal rape! Women are being abused and humiliated. ""On his website,"" John Thompson ""constantly recruits young women:"" If you pass the casting, you start with 25 euros per hour (for gang rape and sexual torture at it's finest). Many of our models earn $ 1,000 a day. (for lifelong injuries on body and soul) ""What women paid for this gage reads like a horror script in the indictment: Bound women are raped by several men at the same time, they are beaten and spit, they become objects and hot candle wax, they are humiliated and literally pulled through the mud. All disgusting details are shown in close up.
 
During the stalking, I was confronted with sex trafficking and forced prostitution, in which the stalker and his friends told me that my real place was also in such a flat-rate brothel as, for example, in Fellbach near Stuttgart, here there were female sex slaves for almost nothing money and the women and girls would open their mouths only for blowjobs. Soon after that , various flatrate brothels were closed down for human trafficking and forced prostitution and unworthy conditions, as many girls and women had to spend a day with hundreds of suitors, entire buses of horny and sadistic men arrived to stage brutal gangbangs with young girls. After the perpetrators were convicted and the brothels were closed, it became known to the public that the young women were in poor health due to many untreated infections and injuries. Because of trafficking and pimping in so-called flat-rate brothels, two men and the female brothel chief from Fellbach became their punishment in court. The Stuttgart district court sent the defendants to jail for several years. Sex like at the all-you-can-eat buffet: The brothel bosses of the “Pussy Club” from Fellbach (Baden-Württemberg) lured men into their brothel with a 70 euro offer: “Sex with all women, like that as long as you want, as often as you want and as you want ”. Two men, these creeps,  have now been sentenced to several years in prison for human trafficking and pimping in ""flat rate brothels"".
 
The Stuttgart district court sentenced the defendants in 2012 to imprisonment terms of eight years and six months and five years and three months. According to the public prosecutor's office, the two men are considered to be the heads of the human trafficking gang.
In their judgment, the judges saw it as proven that they had brought young women from Romania to Germany for years in order to sexually exploit them. The Chamber was convinced that the women had to work as prostitutes in the ""Pussy Club"" in Fellbach near Stuttgart and in brothels in Berlin and other cities. The public has demanded much longer prison sentences for these criminals. From March 2008 to July 2009, they are said to have employed about 200 women and girls, some of them underaged in four brothels with low flat rates. For 100 to 200 euros , the women would have to spend a day available.
My meaning is, the male police means, that all the women are hysterical and implausible. I think nothing of the thesis that stalker are admirers and are harmless, I think this thesis simply idiotic and stupid and it was probably invented to protect these hate crime.
It was also noticeable that during the rental period he only paid his rent in cash and very late in the evening, after he had sent his alleged female Bosnian friend away for days and she then brought him the money in the evening. That earned him the name pimp from our acquaintances. Then he obviously started trouble with all three female tenants. One of them, a elderly lady, had constant arguments about disturbance of the peace, while in the cases of the other two, two young women, we had legitimate suspicions that he had drugged, raped, photographed and blackmailed them, with the help with rape drugs.  That were our young female tenants on the ground floor and in the attic .Then he left behind money, clothes and an unpaid newspaper subscription and was unwilling to clarify this with my husband via email. We didn't have more than an e-mail and a cell phone on that he never answered. During the attempts to clarify, he wrote to my husband and me that we were harassing him and then the nasty processes really started permanently. From 2004-2020 there were many hacking attacks on my husband's computer, where photo files and evidence of stalking disappeared, often the computer was completely destroyed. Also during this time, counterfeit photos of us disappeared in a local shopping center, which mysteriously reappeared until 2020 after months, but in 2020 4 photo orders remained permanently disappeared and it turned out that the shopping center had noticed something wrong that had happened for a long time and had lied to us all the time with an overloaded photo lab. There they did not want to investigate the matter in 2020 either, but said that this was probably our private matter. The photos must have been a lunatic, because at the same time as the photos from 2004-2020 disappeared, there were permanent sexual deepfakes on extremely bad porn, sex and whore customer sites, although there are no nude photos of me, not even bikini photos, I am in favor of it i too careful. No administration and no internet complaints office wanted to take action here because they said that the perpetrators were allegedly abroad and could not be identified. This is how you can call something like that a great nonsense.
Do you really think that a man is harmless, who emailed his landlady rape threats by him signed with Jack from Hell (like the Jack the Ripper letters)?
The unintelligible thing about all of these incidents is that there are idiotic people who support these criminals.
During the first years of stalking I got calls in English from unknown young women,brainless goose,  who offered me love hotlines, admirers hotlines and sometimes mocked me in English and another language, probably Bosnian. One of the mindless female idiots called herself Almira Dobruna, if this lady is real, I can only say, dear girl, where did you leave your brain.
I have therefore the opinion that the cowardly crimes stalking, bullying and rape are punished as hard as possible and that helpers, bystanders and spectators must be also severely punished.
Bullying and stalking, rape culture should not be more straightforward in the future. In cases where bullying and stalking leads to death or ends with rape, gang rape, sexual torture, murder and suicide, there should be high lifelong imprisonment for all parties, including helpers and spectators.
 
You only know how dangerous some people are when something worse happens. My worst fears were confirmed in 2009 when the following was reported through a German pen pal. A pen friend of mine was on Facebook at the time (I was never on Facebook and other social networks, it was too dangerous for me) and referred me to this friend because Anthony Liu had a strange profile with flowers in the background and because this pen pal wanted to see whether Adis Fazlic's hunt on the Internet against me was going on on Facebook. The following was reported at the time, and anyone who knows more has a damned duty to help the police solve the cold case. The Policein Sydney had released 2009 gruesome details about the murder of a man Chen (Anthony) Liu shot multiple times in the head with a high-powered nail gun.A post-mortem examination found that at least 34 nails were fired into the 27-year- old's head before he was weighed down and dumped in a river in Australia. His badly decomposed body was found in marshland in Sydney's Georges River on November 2008 by two children on a canoeing trip.Mr Liu arrived in Melbourne on a student visa from China in early 2000 and moved to Sydney, where he married for a short time and separated, police said. Anyone who witnessed Adis Fazlic's stalking was certain at the time that he was the culprit. I also consider this to be absolutely possible. Only a psychopath can commit such a cruel inhuman act.
 
And at last one greatest misogynists  :Fred Kanitz, Stuttgart: My brother-in-law and half-brother of my husband, the super-bully and misogynist bastard and wife beater:
Fred Kanitz, a rich and successful independent businessman, with mansions, houses at home and abroad, mobbed and terrorized everyone, invariably, but mostly women and girls. this tail-driven ape was also a lover of violent porn videos, which my first sister-in-law hated. Violence and sex obviously belong together for violent criminals. He was also still a domestic violent offender, who abused my first sister-in-law and his two children and he is always unpunished. The terror against me lasted 12 years (1974-1986) Above all, he humiliated my husband without end. He stopped at no one. Whenever we had family reunions, he always came too late, we were not allowed to start drinking coffee he came, otherwise he was raging. His wife and children always came with blow marks, he constantly insulted me with sexually disgusting comments. I'm a very quick-witted and courageous person, I think, but I've been nearly assaulted by him on several occasions because I objected and stopped him. In one case he wanted to beat the children and his wife at the birthday table of my mother-in-law before my eyes. I intervened and he said he like beating a bitch like me.  The people araond were dumbfounded and trembling with fear, so I said, go ahead, I've always wanted to use the bonecrusher trick from my judo course on a living subject. After that were silence, what a joy.
And another time, he said to my mother-in-law's old girlfriends that such women as me he would meet otherwise only in brothels. Yes, I said, it has been rumored that you are the main customer in our city brothel, there was now a syphillis epidemic. The two old ladies were trembling all over and snow-white. My brother-in-law slandered me from the beginning ( I was at that time 18 years old), for example when I was in my parents' house with severe pneumonia and high fever, he claimed that he had seen me in the old town at late night with strange men and that I was a bitch. My parents didn't want to see him after that anymore. Or when I applied for an apprenticeship at the tax office, he called as my supposed husband there and said that he would forbid me to work there and that I was pregnant. And because of this lie, I didn't get the job.
He beat his first wife during the two pregnancies, he hated children, he forced my first sister-in-law to have three abortions in one year. He also terrorized and harassed the female employees in his tax advisor office. And he kept saying to everyone who wanted to hear it or not, women were only there to fuck and even for that they were too stupid!
He forced my second sister-in-law Martina Kanitz to sterilization during a holiday abroad, even though she was only 25 years old and definitely wanted children. Then he named her his free hooker. Before his first wedding, he took underaged girls to his room for sex and then literally chased them away saying that they were worthless whores.
My first sister-in-law found in his well-hidden documents before the divorce, evidence that he was constantly having sex with underaged girls abroad, but nobody wanted to get involved.
After a short time there was no contact with my brother-in-law until today. He verbally and physically terrorized and mistreated his female employees in a extreme way for very long years, a father of a underaged female trainee complained to me and my husband that his daughter had almost committed suicide, I could only point out that he must contact a lawyer and police, what else couldnot done. The brother of my husband deceived and decimated all his business associates and friends. They all complained to me and my husband too about this. And my second sister-in-law Martina Kanitz made it her main hobby to terrorize the female employees, but no wonder with a woman with a pea brain.
 
Then the old parents were on the line, first my very ill old father-in-law, whom Fred Kanitz accused in the hospital of being a simulant and that he was a case for the psychiatry. When I intervened, he terrorized my mother-in-law, telling her to ban me form visting the ill old man. He did not achieve that. When my father-in-law died, he bullied my seriously ill mother-in-law, along with his second wife, who had just married him for the money and was a true luxury female. When my mother-in-law, whom we cared for on her own, as well as for my father-in-law, although my brother-in-law had five minutes his office and his house away, became ill during our vacation, a female neighbor asked my brother-in-law for help. That was a goddamn mistake, because he pushed the poor old neighbour woman when he came almost down the stairs, screaming in rage, and my mother-in-law was forced by him and my sister-in-law to pack her things and the poor old woman was leave with their suitcases in tears in the doorway of a retirement home. In the meantime, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and playful grandson, thieving cleaning lady (this ugly goat was friends with them)  have looted my mother-in-law's account, along with the cleaning lady, sharing the most valuable stamps and coins from my father-in-law's collections, jewelry, and elegant clothing. When we got our mother-in-law out of the old people's home, the disaster had already happened. My mother-in-law threatened suicide if we went to the police. So she died completely broken in another modern retirement home, because it turned out that she had severe Alzheimer's. Before, my brother-in-law wrote two bad letters, we could take care of her now, he declines any responsibility. Well, evil exists, right.
But what I found unbelievable from all those involved was that no one except me had the desire and the courage to report this criminal bastard. I don't think much of lawyers because, two said that if these people were too cowardly to go to court with me as witnesses, I would go under in court and the perpetrator could then take action against me and that would be damn expensive. But honestly, what are laws, lawyers and courts for when criminals can do what they want? I must say, this human cowardice has pissed me off for a lifetime!
And women play a very shameful role  here. Female treason also means excusing the perpetrators and accusing the victims. This is a worldwide disgrace shame.
No wonder men around the world consider women for stupid and inferior. As long as women and girls behave so unsolidly and meanly, that will remain so.
If you are female and think you are safe at home, at school or at work, my experiences will teach you a better one!
I would advise all women, girls, and female children to learn self-defense and martial arts instead of learning to be beautiful and docile. Because the day could come when it saves their lives.
Later I deterred all the aggressors by telling them I practiced on a Grapfruit in a self-defense course, how to squeeze out the eyes of male aggressors.
 
The real scandal, however, is that, like all victims of male violence and sex offenders, I have not received any support or help either in school, college, at work, or even in my own apartment building.
 
How else would it be possible for a little schoolgirl to have to walk a dangerous way to school for two years, where a child molester keeps ambushing her by car. And that despite the fact that there were numerous female witnesses from the beginning.  One of them was as the wicked old neighborhood slut Mrs. Silbereis .That neither the police are involved, that my parents do not give me the bus money for the safe bus and that my grandfather was not willing to accompany me on the way. Yes, some women still thought it was funny and bet whether he would catch me, as a Silesian war-displaced child I was this vicious one worthless to this people. Another treacherous goat like the forester's wife in my place of residence, the mother of my best female friend in the small forest settlement, whom we both asked for help against the persecutor and this woman has forbidden us to continue telling such nonsense, although the perpetrator was even seen by neighbors in the vicinity of the house at night, including her and her husband. We contacted her because the forester called the police in town often about poaching, and we two little girls wanted, that he would go with us to the police so that the persecution on my way to school would finally stop. I must say it very clear, such stupid women protect these perpetrators, the child molesters, and unfortunately this is no exception.
 
Also, how can it be that I am terrorized by a drug addict, sex-obsessed classmate in college for a year and that male teachers and female classmates find that entertaining and amusing? Yes, that not even my own parents found me worthy enough to complain to the extreme misogynist class teacher Mr. Merges (a real wanker) and principal about this vicious student, who had even planned a gang rape plan, and to demand his removal from school.I also wonder, of course, what kind of class teacher like mine , Mr. Merges, in high school has in mind when he laughs at the verbal and personal attacks of the perpetrator in the classroom during the lessons. Such a misogynist idiot  like Mr. Merges should be kicked out of school immediately.
And there were very realistic rumors and reports that Raimund Fritz and his friends during his visits to the Bellinda Sulzbach / Murr disco and the Backnang disco club, underage girls were drugged and Alcohol used and then gang raped (he laughed at it and said the sluts screamed like pigs when they were slaughtered) repeatedly and not just once. Underage sex offenders are also sex offenders (at that time you were only of legal age in Germany at the age of 21) and should be locked away. To this day, nothing has changed about this scandal here in Germany or around the world. When I told my parents that it should be reported, I was laughed at  and they asked me if I was still right in my head. Yes, honestly, the crazy woman is not me, but people who excuse criminals.
 
In addition, how can it be that a young girl is bullied by male sex offenders and from the authorities during her civil service career and no one intervenes and helps there, no superiors (like the sleeping around bitch Marga Wild), no personnel manager, no works council. How can it be that an attempted rape is covered up in an authority and the sex offender is celebrated as potent nice guy and the victim is insulted as a frigid bitch who does not fit into the authority.  After that I was no longer accepted at any agency, I was always told that they knew what kind of person I was. So character assassination was added to the traumatic experiences, behind my back and with impunity.The biggest betrayal in this case was the betrayal of my godmother, a silly goose, that I asked for help after attempting rape at work, because she was friends with a chief detective Mr. Fender, Winnenden, so I hoped this chief detectice could do something in my case. But he said I should keep my mouth shut if I wanted to become a civil servant, life is no picnic. And she wanted to pair me up with his son, both thought that was the solution for my problem. How stupid are these people that they think a minor needs a male friend after an attempted rape? That's a real shame!
 But even my later fiancé and husband stopped the perpetrators not from harassment during the last two years (on the contrary until I resigned I was treated as a miss because my marriage certificate was not recognized and no matter how often I submitted this marriage certificate to the office, the certificate disappeared continuously (thanks to the two bullying idiots Mrs. Wild, my female boss and the HR manager, her lover, Mr. Albrecht) for the whole of last year. They said your husband is an idiot and we do not recognize your marriage, that was my decision to quit.At the end it went so far that my husband was lurked in front of the company door and insulted by a older sex offender Mr. Kienzelmann when he picked me up from work and when he tried to call me at work he was always thrown off the phone line.) My aunt and this alleged police idiot Mr. Fender, Winnenden should have known that sex offenders go on with impunity until they are stopped.
How can it be that two very good school friends of my husband, tail-driven jerks, Rainer Köhler and Wolfgang Kurrle, who also worked at the German Federal Post Office, told my husband that if women like me didn't know where their place would be and when they would be They should have to keep their mouths shut, they should be thrown out of the telecommunications office of the Federal Post Office, quite apart from that, if women did not understand that they should not blame innocent family fathers and that they were not sexually normal, they should immediately belong permanently to psychiatry. That was of course the end of this friendship and I assume that these two wretched bastards were also misogynistic accomplices at the time.
 
How can it be possible that my brother-in-law together with my sister-in-law like Martina Kanitz, a boot-licking slut,was allowed to act so brutally and with impunity against me, my first sister-in-law and her children and my father-in-law and later my mother-in-law, against female defenseless young tax office workers, without that  the many witnesses were willing to intervene or take action against it, whether my parents, my husband, my mother-in-law, relatives, acquaintances, business partner of my brother-in-law, these people excused even the worst incidents and insults (before they became victims themselves of this bastard).  It's a scandal for everyone who looked the other way at the time and said I should shut up and not disturb the family. It was also an unbelievable mess that my brother-in-law simply more or less stole money of the bank accounts of my in-laws and my husband as their tax advisor, and the subsequent tax advisor, this incompetent fool, my husband's godfather, covered him up and said it was a scandal for my sick mother-in-law and a death sentence for her, we could live well without the money and if we went to the police, he wouldn't testify for us. My mother-in-law then wanted to kill herself and my husband then called no police. After all, my brother-in-law had enough money to buy houses abroad. Why do stupid people cover up such criminals?
It is also monstrous that Fred Kanitz was able to boast with impunity for years of rapes and shootings of Indians (we hunted them like rabbits with horses and guns, he said) in countries like Paraguay and Uruguay, where he had haciendas. Nobody felt responsible, our law firm at the time and also the tax consultancy office with lawyers said we should stay out of it. They, those cowardly fools , said that we, my husband and I, would be laughed at if we report this and since it’s about foreign countries and we have no evidence, we’ll get a line for defamation! Incredible, is not it?
 
How can it be that a stalker (very dangerous because he was addicted to cocaine, we found traces in his room and our toilet)  has been up with his mischief for 17 years  and none of these cowards reported him! Not even the mother of the female tenant, who was probably the victim of a rape drug used by the perpetrator. And the greatest betrayal was probably that of an administrator of a stalking forum  in Hesse, Günter Dantrimont, one of the biggest male assholes, I have ever seen in my life, who, as it turned out later, always sided with the perpetrators. How did this idiot get to such a forum? And support from counseling centers, internet complaints offices, administrators of websites, women's organizations, even from a female lawyer in stalking counseling only came in that kind that I should ignore everything, that would stop by itself. Does it look like it? What are these supposed experts good for if nothing is done, only that these people have nice websites?
 
I also wonder when Adis Fazlic and his friends sent me a lot of sadistic BDSM porn emails with obvious private recordings and very unhappy looking, partly bound and gagged girls and young women, especially from 2004-2006, when that was not voluntary and it didn't look like that, why are the perpetrators and his friends not in prison to this day? It is ridiculous to claim that this kind of sex is voluntary, who wants to be tortured voluntarily and still humiliated by filming and taking photos put on the net? And it is also embarrassing that all the complaints offices that I had contacted declared that they were not responsible!
 I also wonder what kind of neighbors I have who supposedly haven't noticed anything over the years. Only one neighbor called the police twice in 2006 because someone wanted to break into the workshop door at night. In 2004, when the tenant fished the mail out of my mailbox,( I caught his hand in my mailbox at the end of the rental period), where he claimed that his letter had landed in my mailbox, pretty much all the neighbors saw it, but did nothing. Also in 2004, towards the end of the rental period, when he was rummaging through the garbage at night and once distributed the used sanitary towels over the night, someone must have seen it, because opening the garbage lids (these dumpsters are far from the house)  makes noise. But there was no reaction of anyone. A female friend was visting me the day before and everything was okay with the garbage until the late evening. The next morning the garbage was strewn across the courtyard for all to see and the sanitary towels from me and the female tenant on the ground floor were on top. When I asked the tenant, he claimed it was the birds. Clearly, birds have nothing else to do, like lifting garbage lids and throwing used sanitary towels.I laughed and shook my head! My antisocial neighbors,  anti-social, are a scandal. A call to the police would have ended all nightly operationsand the stalking at once. But cowardice has a name ...",0,0,Event,27399238,0,comment,2022-01-06T18:44:54Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],27399238,27399238,DO NOT HIRE AMBER HEARD FOR TANGLED LIVE ACTION,2021-02-16T19:36:47Z,,2021-02-16T19:37:35Z,2022-01-26T20:44:25Z,en-US,['en'],Walt Disney: DO NOT HIRE AMBER HEARD FOR TANGLED LIVE ACTION,"<p>Amber Heard has been exposed as a domestic abuser by Johnny Depp. In his $50 million lawsuit, Johnny Depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife Amber Heard, including one incident where she punched him twice in the face and another where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached.

<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Walt Disney Sudiosshould and must not consider Heard for their Tangled film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser.</p>

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Walt Disney Sudiosshould and must not consider Heard for their Tangled film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF PERSON WE NEED OUR CHILDREN LOOKING UP TO AS A ROLE MODEL��</p>
