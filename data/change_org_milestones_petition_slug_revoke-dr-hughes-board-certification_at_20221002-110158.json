I am here to say this is not cancel culture. People have got to stop defending crumby people, and exclaiming it is cancel culture. If you are a bad person, you make conscious decisions to do poor choices in life, you try to minimize, and further antagonize DV victims, then you do not deserve to practice anymore. Plain and simple. There is no argument to it.\u00a0</p>", "photo": {"id": "226610425", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/0/wi/jw/YywIjwKkHJdWHaZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652308538", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "30527510", "createdAt": "2022-05-08T13:50:42.000Z", "signatureCount": 1500}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "30526337", "createdAt": "2022-05-08T02:37:44.000Z", "title": "Almost to 1,500 signatures \ufffd", "description": "<p>Hey everyone, this shared picture is why we all need to use our voices!
