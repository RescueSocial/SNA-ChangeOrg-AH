I had informed you that, I had a hearing on 2nd September. This proceeding was vacated and so was the others that were due after it. However, steps are being taken to try and find a way to return us to the UK.

<p>My name is Eda Fearon Murray and in July 2017 we started to live in Spain. We were encouraged to live here by my ex-partner, who is the children's father as a family. My children and I have grown to love being in this country and we definitely want to remain here. The abuse started long before deciding to live in Spain which was the children's father's ultimate dream. I have come to realise that being in a violent relationship impacts your ability to think clearly when fear takes over and as such, it is too hard to convince the person on the receiving end. My children and I have been coming here for skiing and fell in love with the culture during our many visits and now we do not wish to return to the UK. My children have an abundance of outdoor activities that they have come to love and enjoy participating in. The children now speak the language fluently and although I do not, I still have not given up and I continue to teach myself using various methods. The deed of the house in Spain is in my name only and was bought in 2014 using my money which I acquired as a result of being forced to sell my property I owned when we were living in the UK prior to meeting him. My former partner would go around telling everyone that the property belonged to him, not even us, just him, even though he was never a contributor whilst we were living together in the UK and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION PART 2</strong></p>
<p>I am kindly asking for help in letting our voices be heard because the years of abuse have deeply scarred us. I am a single parent of two children and we have been living in Spain for the past 5 years. We were relocated as a family unit of four in July 2017 at the request of my now former partner. We came here as a family for a fresh start or so I had hoped but that was not the outcome. The children's father was more familiar with this part of Spain than I was because I found out much later that he had been searching for a property to acquire and saw this in 2005 before we met in 2007. We intended to give our children a better quality of life, whilst learning the culture along with the benefit of being multilingual.Â </p>
<p><strong>INCEPTION OF ABUSE</strong></p>
<p>For ten years we have endured domestic abuse and violence at the hands of my former partner who is the father of the two children. After the children were born, they too experienced his abuse of him and he would hurt me both physically and verbally in front of them to prove that he is in control. I was not allowed to go anywhere with my friends without him, or he would get extremely angry. In 2009 a year after my first child was born, my former partner forced me to send an email to my job stating that I was not ready to return to work and his demand for him came with physical pain if I did not comply. He would do everything to increase the distance between me and family / friends and relocating us to Spain was to be his last. The scar on my shoulder is a constant reminder of my life in Croydon, London and I was forced to give up my job and forced to sell my property in Central London. We were kicked out of bed several times, with my first born and forced to sleep on his dirty sofa by him. he always kicked me and I would wake up with bruises all over my legs and thighs and then one night he punched me in my face whilst I slept. It immediately woke me up and I eventually had to start wearing braces again in 2008 after successfully completing my treatment in 2004. He had gone unpunished in England for battering me and attacking our children constantly, saying that he is God and believing that he should always have ultimate control. I have proof of the abuse that we endured whilst living at his flat in the UK. The abuse never stopped and it started almost immediately as soon as we started settling down in Spain and I was constantly reminded that we lived in a cave and nobody could hear my screams, especially my neighbours. The screaming never stopped and my children were exposed to my trauma and they pleaded with their father to stop hurting mummy but that did not stop him because he had no compassion and wanted us all to live in fear.</p>
<p><strong>FAMILY COURT ENGLAND</strong></p>
<p>A decision was made by the Family High Court in England that my children should return to England. My children who are currently aged 13 and 10 years old have told the court that they wish to remain in Spain. As stated previously we have been living here legally for 5 years and the children are fluent in English and Spanish. My children do not wish to return to England and have told the court why they are not happy with their decision. My children were described as very articulate and confident by the court in England; however, they do not believe the children are old enough to decide for themselves. The draconian method used by the Court in England intends to take away their freedom of choice whilst disregarding their pleas to remain in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>AUGUST 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner had attacked me and the girls in August 2017 and once again, I was hiding in the children's bedroom. My former partner's family members stayed at the property on August 21st and 22nd and he verbally attacked me when I was getting the children ready for bed in their room. He thought that because the cave is soundproof and that his family members of him were on the other side of the house that they would not hear him. The pleading and the screams from both me and the children continued in the earliest part of the morning and it made him angrier. He left the room and returned with my favourite cup with hot tea that he used to burn me with on my body. I reacted immediately knocked the cup from his hands sending it crashing to the floor. One of my former partners' family members heard us screaming and came to our aid and he was escorted outside.</p>
<p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>The abuse had gotten worse between <strong>September 25th and 26th</strong> because this time he threatened to kill me and described how he would explain it to the police so he would get away with murder. During the dreadful night in <strong>September 2017</strong>, I made several contacts with friends and a police officer who was looking to question my former partner for something that he had done at the school he taught whilst living in the UK. Prior to the incident of September 2017, I received a text message from the same UK officer and at first thought it was a scam but this officer and a relative in the UK who I contacted via text message was soon to be my saviour. Whilst I hid in my children's bedroom in fear of my life, I described the environment to the UK officer and a relative and my former partner came in shouting and continued to be very abusive. The youngest child got terrible ill that night because she was shouting and pleading her father to stop but he did not and it continued into the early hours of the morning. I left their room and went to the kitchen to get medicine for my youngest child and he continued shouting at me whilst in the corridor. I went quickly to their room and closed the door behind me, but he came kicking and banging on the door, which caused the medicine to spill on my hand and onto the floor as I braced the door with my back and pleaded with him to stop . I was able to quickly refill the measuring cup and administer the medicine to get rid of the fever. My children were already accepted into a school in Town and scheduled to start in the morning and I was so terrified for our lives and could not sleep. My former partner was not aware that I was communicating with trembling fingers via text messages throughout the entire order. I tried again to stop him from entering the children's room, but it was of no use and he came in and attacked me bruising my arm and stated that he is ""God."" The children would bear witness as they have for many years and succumbed to some of the attacks when we were living in the UK.</p>
<p>On the night of <strong>August 2017</strong>, we had guests and I thought that this would somehow deter him from behaving badly, but it never did. However, to my relief the guests who took him away, heard the children screaming in the middle of the night. On the <strong>dreadful night of September 2017</strong>, he shouted that ""no one can hear you scream."" It was morning, I returned to our bedroom. The inner doors on the property can close but cannot be locked and I was quietly stacking boxes of clothes that were not yet unpacked since we had only moved July 2017 to secure the door. This made him once again tried to enter the room, I listened as he described how he would tell the police that I was having a mental breakdown and he was acting in self-defence to protect him and his children from me. All the abuse I suffered in England had not prepared me for this kind of fear, I was going to be killed by the children's father. It was as if he had planned it and he truly believed that the Spanish authority would believe him. The officer I was in communication with that night had helped me tremendously. I did not accompany my former partner when he dropped the children off school. I immediately called the police and in very poor Spanish, I cried out for help.</p>
<p><strong>ARRESTED SEPTEMBER 2017</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner returned with my youngest daughter who was still very sick and I took her inside the other part of the property and I locked the door whilst I waited for the Spanish police officer. When they arrived, I quickly came out and I called the friend in Spain, who translated for me and while outside he tried to grab at me and said that he and his partner had a little argument. I did not see it that way and they held him back and handcuffed him at that moment and he was arrested, placed in a cell where he spent a night. Things were never the same, but I tried to ensure that this did not interrupt the plans we had for our children. The Spanish Court awarded me full custody and he decided to get even, when theÂ court awarded me an injunction against him, he broke them many times and no action was taken against him.</p>
<p><strong>ONGOING COURT CASE</strong></p>
<p>He was very disrespectful to the judge, lawyer and the interpreter who was assigned to represent him in Spain. His tone of him was aggressive and he continued to act poorly in a disdainful manner. My former partner was able to successfully attain legal service from the <strong>law Firm Beck Fitzgerald</strong> and in July 2021. With the court hearing only his side of the story, they proceeded. I was accused of kidnapping our children to Spain and that I was the one who was the abuser, with a mental problem. The court in the UK eventually changed the claim to ""retention"" of the children instead. The high court in the UK found the court in Spain incompetent and as such they had jurisdiction from October - November 2017. Despite what happened to me and my children he was never convicted for his crime in Spain and we are still scared because I had completely forgotten that I had recorded the night of 25-26 September 2017. I found this evidence in December 2021. I was forced to represent myself in court in Spain because I could not afford a lawyer nor could I afford a lawyer in England. I was inexperienced and my first and second submission document to the court provided evidence that I am not mental and have never ever been diagnosed as such. It was not until his family became aware of the abuse that I was informed that he was considered mentally incapable and should never have full custody of our children. The first court hearing was on September 23, 2021, I was not in attendance. I made sure that all court documents sent to me thereafter were carefully reviewed to prepare me for the other upcoming court hearing. At the court hearing on September 23, 2021, my former partner signed a court document that stated that he should not be in any communication with mother and children, which should last until 6pm on 11 February 2022. He started a complaint against me in Spain and on the 1st December 2021, I was attending a hearing of which I was being accused of not allowing him to communicate with his children as ordered by the Spanish court judgment of 2017. However, this was not true as it was proven that the father have been communicating with our children currently and from 2017 During the trial I was interrogated by the Spanish judge whilst the father was absent, I later fainted and the trial was postponed until May 2022. The Spanish court judgment of 2017 stated that the father should make child support payments of â¬300 each. He also stop paying the meagre child support of Â£135 for each child. I have accepted and agreed with the judge in England that mandatory video communication will continue and this has not stopped.</p>
<p><strong>THE INCOMPETENT</strong></p>
<p>As stated, the court in England and Wales found the Spanish court incompetent and now the father's lawyer seek the Spanish cooperation to return us into the custody of the father and seek to do this under Annex IV certificate under Brussels II Revised. At the last trial, held recently on 26 July 2022, the father's lawyer asked the judge to set aside my written domestic violence allegation as it is ""historic"" was his words, but thankfully the judge ignored the statement.</p>
<p><strong>UNSUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS</strong></p>
<p>I just want to give you a recap of the several claims my former partner made against me in court that has no truth to it. Firstly, he stated that the property in Spain was his and he is unable to provide financial documents to show how he acquired the money, despite him owning two flats in the UK and was dependent on my income before and after the children were born. Secondly, he told the court in the UK that I was mentally unstable and I would start behaving erratically and abuse him and the children. Thirdly, he badgered the children into believing that he was only trying to protect them from me whilst on unsupervised video communication which traumatised them repeatedly. Also, he alleged that I contacted one of his siblings from him to gather information that could negatively affect him. That sibling told me what my former partner told him about the abuse and he also revealed other shocking revelations told to him by my former partner. The father's lawyer in the UK instead rebuked and reduced me to being incompetent and untrustworthy and threw out the evidence that was submitted by his sibling of him. The most recent claim is that he is 'Johnny Depp' and I am 'Amber Heard' who is trying to destroy him and attack his credibility. It is him who has defamed and humiliated me through the countless judges that were assigned to this case. I am a private person and kept the years of abuse a secret because I was scared for life and felt helpless. The UK court has failed to protect domestic abuse victims but instead encouraged his disdain towards me in an effort to destroy me completely.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING</strong></p>
<p>I implore you good people out there to assist in any way that is possible because I speak the truth and I do hope that good will prevail despite all the negative claims that have been made against me and my children. Please help us and sign our petition so we can stay in Spain and finally put this traumatic situation behind us because you definitely have not heard most of our horror. The next court hearing is scheduled for September 2022 and I am remaining positive. He has alleged that he is Johnny Depp and I am Amber Heard which has no similarity to our situation because the abuse me and my children endured needs to end. I will once again have no legal representation, but with your help, I am determined to remain strong and persevere.</p>

He left the room and returned with my favourite cup with hot tea that he used to burn me with on my body. I reacted immediately knocked the cup from his hands sending it crashing to the floor. One of my former partners' family members heard us screaming and came to our aid and he was escorted outside.</p>
<p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>The abuse had gotten worse between <strong>September 25th and 26th</strong> because this time he threatened to kill me and described how he would explain it to the police so he would get away with murder. During the dreadful night in <strong>September 2017</strong>, I made several contacts with friends and a police officer who was looking to question my former partner for something that he had done at the school he taught whilst living in the UK. Prior to the incident of September 2017, I received a text message from the same UK officer and at first thought it was a scam but this officer and a relative in the UK who I contacted via text message was soon to be my saviour. Whilst I hid in my children's bedroom in fear of my life, I described the environment to the UK officer and a relative and my former partner came in shouting and continued to be very abusive. The youngest child got terrible ill that night because she was shouting and pleading her father to stop but he did not and it continued into the early hours of the morning. I left their room and went to the kitchen to get medicine for my youngest child and he continued shouting at me whilst in the corridor. I went quickly to their room and closed the door behind me, but he came kicking and banging on the door, which caused the medicine to spill on my hand and onto the floor as I braced the door with my back and pleaded with him to stop . I was able to quickly refill the measuring cup and administer the medicine to get rid of the fever. My children were already accepted into a school in Town and scheduled to start in the morning and I was so terrified for our lives and could not sleep. My former partner was not aware that I was communicating with trembling fingers via text messages throughout the entire order. I tried again to stop him from entering the children's room, but it was of no use and he came in and attacked me bruising my arm and stated that he is ""God."" The children would bear witness as they have for many years and succumbed to some of the attacks when we were living in the UK.</p>
<p>On the night of <strong>August 2017</strong>, we had guests and I thought that this would somehow deter him from behaving badly, but it never did. However, to my relief the guests who took him away, heard the children screaming in the middle of the night. On the <strong>dreadful night of September 2017</strong>, he shouted that ""no one can hear you scream."" It was morning, I returned to our bedroom. The inner doors on the property can close but cannot be locked and I was quietly stacking boxes of clothes that were not yet unpacked since we had only moved July 2017 to secure the door. This made him once again tried to enter the room, I listened as he described how he would tell the police that I was having a mental breakdown and he was acting in self-defence to protect him and his children from me. All the abuse I suffered in England had not prepared me for this kind of fear, I was going to be killed by the children's father. It was as if he had planned it and he truly believed that the Spanish authority would believe him. The officer I was in communication with that night had helped me tremendously. I did not accompany my former partner when he dropped the children off school. I immediately called the police and in very poor Spanish, I cried out for help.</p>
<p><strong>ARRESTED SEPTEMBER 2017</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner returned with my youngest daughter who was still very sick and I took her inside the other part of the property and I locked the door whilst I waited for the Spanish police officer. When they arrived, I quickly came out and I called the friend in Spain, who translated for me and while outside he tried to grab at me and said that he and his partner had a little argument. I did not see it that way and they held him back and handcuffed him at that moment and he was arrested, placed in a cell where he spent a night. Things were never the same, but I tried to ensure that this did not interrupt the plans we had for our children. The Spanish Court awarded me full custody and he decided to get even, when theÂ court awarded me an injunction against him, he broke them many times and no action was taken against him.</p>
<p><strong>ONGOING COURT CASE</strong></p>
<p>He was very disrespectful to the judge, lawyer and the interpreter who was assigned to represent him in Spain. His tone of him was aggressive and he continued to act poorly in a disdainful manner. My former partner was able to successfully attain legal service from the <strong>law Firm Beck Fitzgerald</strong> and in July 2021. With the court hearing only his side of the story, they proceeded. I was accused of kidnapping our children to Spain and that I was the one who was the abuser, with a mental problem. The court in the UK eventually changed the claim to ""retention"" of the children instead. The high court in the UK found the court in Spain incompetent and as such they had jurisdiction from October - November 2017. Despite what happened to me and my children he was never convicted for his crime in Spain and we are still scared because I had completely forgotten that I had recorded the night of 25-26 September 2017. I found this evidence in December 2021. I was forced to represent myself in court in Spain because I could not afford a lawyer nor could I afford a lawyer in England. I was inexperienced and my first and second submission document to the court provided evidence that I am not mental and have never ever been diagnosed as such. It was not until his family became aware of the abuse that I was informed that he was considered mentally incapable and should never have full custody of our children. The first court hearing was on September 23, 2021, I was not in attendance. I made sure that all court documents sent to me thereafter were carefully reviewed to prepare me for the other upcoming court hearing. At the court hearing on September 23, 2021, my former partner signed a court document that stated that he should not be in any communication with mother and children, which should last until 6pm on 11 February 2022. He started a complaint against me in Spain and on the 1st December 2021, I was attending a hearing of which I was being accused of not allowing him to communicate with his children as ordered by the Spanish court judgment of 2017. However, this was not true as it was proven that the father have been communicating with our children currently and from 2017 During the trial I was interrogated by the Spanish judge whilst the father was absent, I later fainted and the trial was postponed until May 2022. The Spanish court judgment of 2017 stated that the father should make child support payments of â¬300 each. He also stop paying the meagre child support of Â£135 for each child. I have accepted and agreed with the judge in England that mandatory video communication will continue and this has not stopped.</p>
<p><strong>THE INCOMPETENT</strong></p>
<p>As stated, the court in England and Wales found the Spanish court incompetent and now the father's lawyer seek the Spanish cooperation to return us into the custody of the father and seek to do this under Annex IV certificate under Brussels II Revised. At the last trial, held recently on 26 July 2022, the father's lawyer asked the judge to set aside my written domestic violence allegation as it is ""historic"" was his words, but thankfully the judge ignored the statement.</p>
<p><strong>UNSUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS</strong></p>
<p>I just want to give you a recap of the several claims my former partner made against me in court that has no truth to it. Firstly, he stated that the property in Spain was his and he is unable to provide financial documents to show how he acquired the money, despite him owning two flats in the UK and was dependent on my income before and after the children were born. Secondly, he told the court in the UK that I was mentally unstable and I would start behaving erratically and abuse him and the children. Thirdly, he badgered the children into believing that he was only trying to protect them from me whilst on unsupervised video communication which traumatised them repeatedly. Also, he alleged that I contacted one of his siblings from him to gather information that could negatively affect him. That sibling told me what my former partner told him about the abuse and he also revealed other shocking revelations told to him by my former partner. The father's lawyer in the UK instead rebuked and reduced me to being incompetent and untrustworthy and threw out the evidence that was submitted by his sibling of him. The most recent claim is that he is 'Johnny Depp' and I am 'Amber Heard' who is trying to destroy him and attack his credibility. It is him who has defamed and humiliated me through the countless judges that were assigned to this case. I am a private person and kept the years of abuse a secret because I was scared for life and felt helpless. The UK court has failed to protect domestic abuse victims but instead encouraged his disdain towards me in an effort to destroy me completely.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING</strong></p>
<p>I implore you good people out there to assist in any way that is possible because I speak the truth and I do hope that good will prevail despite all the negative claims that have been made against me and my children. Please help us and sign our petition so we can stay in Spain and finally put this traumatic situation behind us because you definitely have not heard most of our horror. The next court hearing is scheduled for September 2022 and I am remaining positive. He has alleged that he is Johnny Depp and I am Amber Heard which has no similarity to our situation because the abuse me and my children endured needs to end. I will once again have no legal representation, but with your help, I am determined to remain strong and persevere.</p>

<p>My name is Eda Fearon Murray and in July 2017 we started to live in Spain. We were encouraged to live here by my ex-partner, who is the children's father as a family. My children and I have grown to love being in this country and we definitely want to remain here. The abuse started long before deciding to live in Spain which was the children's father's ultimate dream. I have come to realise that being in a violent relationship impacts your ability to think clearly when fear takes over and as such, it is too hard to convince the person on the receiving end. My children and I have been coming here for skiing and fell in love with the culture during our many visits and now we do not wish to return to the UK. My children have an abundance of outdoor activities that they have come to love and enjoy participating in. The children now speak the language fluently and although I do not, I still have not given up and I continue to teach myself using various methods. The deed of the house in Spain is in my name only and was bought in 2014 using my money which I acquired as a result of being forced to sell my property I owned when we were living in the UK prior to meeting him. My former partner would go around telling everyone that the property belonged to him, not even us, just him, even though he was never a contributor whilst we were living together in the UK and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION PART 2</strong></p>
<p>I am kindly asking for help in letting our voices be heard because the years of abuse have deeply scarred us. I am a single parent of two children and we have been living in Spain for the past 5 years. We were relocated as a family unit of four in July 2017 at the request of my now former partner. We came here as a family for a fresh start or so I had hoped but that was not the outcome. The children's father was more familiar with this part of Spain than I was because I found out much later that he had been searching for a property to acquire and saw this in 2005 before we met in 2007. We intended to give our children a better quality of life, whilst learning the culture along with the benefit of being multilingual.Â </p>
<p><strong>INCEPTION OF ABUSE</strong></p>
<p>For ten years we have endured domestic abuse and violence at the hands of my former partner who is the father of the two children. After the children were born, they too experienced his abuse of him and he would hurt me both physically and verbally in front of them to prove that he is in control. I was not allowed to go anywhere with my friends without him, or he would get extremely angry. In 2009 a year after my first child was born, my former partner forced me to send an email to my job stating that I was not ready to return to work and his demand for him came with physical pain if I did not comply. He would do everything to increase the distance between me and family / friends and relocating us to Spain was to be his last. The scar on my shoulder is a constant reminder of my life in Croydon, London and I was forced to give up my job and forced to sell my property in Central London. We were kicked out of bed several times, with my first born and forced to sleep on his dirty sofa by him. he always kicked me and I would wake up with bruises all over my legs and thighs and then one night he punched me in my face whilst I slept. It immediately woke me up and I eventually had to start wearing braces again in 2008 after successfully completing my treatment in 2004. He had gone unpunished in England for battering me and attacking our children constantly, saying that he is God and believing that he should always have ultimate control. I have proof of the abuse that we endured whilst living at his flat in the UK. The abuse never stopped and it started almost immediately as soon as we started settling down in Spain and I was constantly reminded that we lived in a cave and nobody could hear my screams, especially my neighbours. The screaming never stopped and my children were exposed to my trauma and they pleaded with their father to stop hurting mummy but that did not stop him because he had no compassion and wanted us all to live in fear.</p>
<p><strong>FAMILY COURT ENGLAND</strong></p>
<p>A decision was made by the Family High Court in England that my children should return to England. My children who are currently aged 13 and 10 years old have told the court that they wish to remain in Spain. As stated previously we have been living here legally for 5 years and the children are fluent in English and Spanish. My children do not wish to return to England and have told the court why they are not happy with their decision. My children were described as very articulate and confident by the court in England; however, they do not believe the children are old enough to decide for themselves. The draconian method used by the Court in England intends to take away their freedom of choice whilst disregarding their pleas to remain in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>AUGUST 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner had attacked me and the girls in August 2017 and once again, I was hiding in the children's bedroom. My former partner's family members stayed at the property on August 21st and 22nd and he verbally attacked me when I was getting the children ready for bed in their room. He thought that because the cave is soundproof and that his family members of him were on the other side of the house that they would not hear him. The pleading and the screams from both me and the children continued in the earliest part of the morning and it made him angrier. He left the room and returned with my favourite cup with hot tea that he used to burn me with on my body. I reacted immediately knocked the cup from his hands sending it crashing to the floor. One of my former partners' family members heard us screaming and came to our aid and he was escorted outside.</p>
<p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>The abuse had gotten worse between <strong>September 25th and 26th</strong> because this time he threatened to kill me and described how he would explain it to the police so he would get away with murder. During the dreadful night in <strong>September 2017</strong>, I made several contacts with friends and a police officer who was looking to question my former partner for something that he had done at the school he taught whilst living in the UK. Prior to the incident of September 2017, I received a text message from the same UK officer and at first thought it was a scam but this officer and a relative in the UK who I contacted via text message was soon to be my saviour.

<p>My name is Eda Fearon Murray and in July 2017 we started to live in Spain. We were encouraged to live here by my ex-partner, who is the children's father as a family. My children and I have grown to love being in this country and we definitely want to remain here. The abuse started long before deciding to live in Spain which was the children's father's ultimate dream. I have come to realise that being in a violent relationship impacts your ability to think clearly when fear takes over and as such, it is too hard to convince the person on the receiving end. My children and I have been coming here for skiing and fell in love with the culture during our many visits and now we do not wish to return to the UK. My children have an abundance of outdoor activities that they have come to love and enjoy participating in. The children now speak the language fluently and although I do not, I still have not given up and I continue to teach myself using various methods. The deed of the house in Spain is in my name only and was bought in 2014 using my money which I acquired as a result of being forced to sell my property I owned when we were living in the UK prior to meeting him. My former partner would go around telling everyone that the property belonged to him, not even us, just him, even though he was never a contributor whilst we were living together in the UK and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION PART 2</strong></p>
<p>I am kindly asking for help in letting our voices be heard because the years of abuse have deeply scarred us. I am a single parent of two children and we have been living in Spain for the past 5 years. We were relocated as a family unit of four in July 2017 at the request of my now former partner. We came here as a family for a fresh start or so I had hoped but that was not the outcome. The children's father was more familiar with this part of Spain than I was because I found out much later that he had been searching for a property to acquire and saw this in 2005 before we met in 2007. We intended to give our children a better quality of life, whilst learning the culture along with the benefit of being multilingual.Â </p>
<p><strong>INCEPTION OF ABUSE</strong></p>
<p>For ten years we have endured domestic abuse and violence at the hands of my former partner who is the father of the two children. After the children were born, they too experienced his abuse of him and he would hurt me both physically and verbally in front of them to prove that he is in control. I was not allowed to go anywhere with my friends without him, or he would get extremely angry. In 2009 a year after my first child was born, my former partner forced me to send an email to my job stating that I was not ready to return to work and his demand for him came with physical pain if I did not comply. He would do everything to increase the distance between me and family / friends and relocating us to Spain was to be his last. The scar on my shoulder is a constant reminder of my life in Croydon, London and I was forced to give up my job and forced to sell my property in Central London. We were kicked out of bed several times, with my first born and forced to sleep on his dirty sofa by him. he always kicked me and I would wake up with bruises all over my legs and thighs and then one night he punched me in my face whilst I slept. It immediately woke me up and I eventually had to start wearing braces again in 2008 after successfully completing my treatment in 2004. He had gone unpunished in England for battering me and attacking our children constantly, saying that he is God and believing that he should always have ultimate control. I have proof of the abuse that we endured whilst living at his flat in the UK. The abuse never stopped and it started almost immediately as soon as we started settling down in Spain and I was constantly reminded that we lived in a cave and nobody could hear my screams, especially my neighbours. The screaming never stopped and my children were exposed to my trauma and they pleaded with their father to stop hurting mummy but that did not stop him because he had no compassion and wanted us all to live in fear.</p>
<p><strong>FAMILY COURT ENGLAND</strong></p>
<p>A decision was made by the Family High Court in England that my children should return to England. My children who are currently aged 13 and 10 years old have told the court that they wish to remain in Spain. As stated previously we have been living here legally for 5 years and the children are fluent in English and Spanish. My children do not wish to return to England and have told the court why they are not happy with their decision. My children were described as very articulate and confident by the court in England; however, they do not believe the children are old enough to decide for themselves. The draconian method used by the Court in England intends to take away their freedom of choice whilst disregarding their pleas to remain in Spain.</p>
<p><strong>AUGUST 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner had attacked me and the girls in August 2017 and once again, I was hiding in the children's bedroom. My former partner's family members stayed at the property on August 21st and 22nd and he verbally attacked me when I was getting the children ready for bed in their room. He thought that because the cave is soundproof and that his family members of him were on the other side of the house that they would not hear him. The pleading and the screams from both me and the children continued in the earliest part of the morning and it made him angrier. He left the room and returned with my favourite cup with hot tea that he used to burn me with on my body. I reacted immediately knocked the cup from his hands sending it crashing to the floor. One of my former partners' family members heard us screaming and came to our aid and he was escorted outside.</p>
<p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2017 INCIDENT</strong></p>
<p>The abuse had gotten worse between <strong>September 25th and 26th</strong> because this time he threatened to kill me and described how he would explain it to the police so he would get away with murder. During the dreadful night in <strong>September 2017</strong>, I made several contacts with friends and a police officer who was looking to question my former partner for something that he had done at the school he taught whilst living in the UK. Prior to the incident of September 2017, I received a text message from the same UK officer and at first thought it was a scam but this officer and a relative in the UK who I contacted via text message was soon to be my saviour. Whilst I hid in my children's bedroom in fear of my life, I described the environment to the UK officer and a relative and my former partner came in shouting and continued to be very abusive. The youngest child got terrible ill that night because she was shouting and pleading her father to stop but he did not and it continued into the early hours of the morning. I left their room and went to the kitchen to get medicine for my youngest child and he continued shouting at me whilst in the corridor. I went quickly to their room and closed the door behind me, but he came kicking and banging on the door, which caused the medicine to spill on my hand and onto the floor as I braced the door with my back and pleaded with him to stop . I was able to quickly refill the measuring cup and administer the medicine to get rid of the fever. My children were already accepted into a school in Town and scheduled to start in the morning and I was so terrified for our lives and could not sleep. My former partner was not aware that I was communicating with trembling fingers via text messages throughout the entire order. I tried again to stop him from entering the children's room, but it was of no use and he came in and attacked me bruising my arm and stated that he is ""God."" The children would bear witness as they have for many years and succumbed to some of the attacks when we were living in the UK.</p>
<p>On the night of <strong>August 2017</strong>, we had guests and I thought that this would somehow deter him from behaving badly, but it never did. However, to my relief the guests who took him away, heard the children screaming in the middle of the night. On the <strong>dreadful night of September 2017</strong>, he shouted that ""no one can hear you scream."" It was morning, I returned to our bedroom. The inner doors on the property can close but cannot be locked and I was quietly stacking boxes of clothes that were not yet unpacked since we had only moved July 2017 to secure the door. This made him once again tried to enter the room, I listened as he described how he would tell the police that I was having a mental breakdown and he was acting in self-defence to protect him and his children from me. All the abuse I suffered in England had not prepared me for this kind of fear, I was going to be killed by the children's father. It was as if he had planned it and he truly believed that the Spanish authority would believe him. The officer I was in communication with that night had helped me tremendously. I did not accompany my former partner when he dropped the children off school. I immediately called the police and in very poor Spanish, I cried out for help.</p>
<p><strong>ARRESTED SEPTEMBER 2017</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner returned with my youngest daughter who was still very sick and I took her inside the other part of the property and I locked the door whilst I waited for the Spanish police officer. When they arrived, I quickly came out and I called the friend in Spain, who translated for me and while outside he tried to grab at me and said that he and his partner had a little argument. I did not see it that way and they held him back and handcuffed him at that moment and he was arrested, placed in a cell where he spent a night. Things were never the same, but I tried to ensure that this did not interrupt the plans we had for our children. The Spanish Court awarded me full custody and he decided to get even, when theÂ court awarded me an injunction against him, he broke them many times and no action was taken against him.</p>
<p><strong>ONGOING COURT CASE</strong></p>
<p>He was very disrespectful to the judge, lawyer and the interpreter who was assigned to represent him in Spain. His tone of him was aggressive and he continued to act poorly in a disdainful manner. My former partner was able to successfully attain legal service from the <strong>law Firm Beck Fitzgerald</strong> and in July 2021. With the court hearing only his side of the story, they proceeded. I was accused of kidnapping our children to Spain and that I was the one who was the abuser, with a mental problem. The court in the UK eventually changed the claim to ""retention"" of the children instead. The high court in the UK found the court in Spain incompetent and as such they had jurisdiction from October - November 2017. Despite what happened to me and my children he was never convicted for his crime in Spain and we are still scared because I had completely forgotten that I had recorded the night of 25-26 September 2017. I found this evidence in December 2021. I was forced to represent myself in court in Spain because I could not afford a lawyer nor could I afford a lawyer in England. I was inexperienced and my first and second submission document to the court provided evidence that I am not mental and have never ever been diagnosed as such. It was not until his family became aware of the abuse that I was informed that he was considered mentally incapable and should never have full custody of our children. The first court hearing was on September 23, 2021, I was not in attendance. I made sure that all court documents sent to me thereafter were carefully reviewed to prepare me for the other upcoming court hearing. At the court hearing on September 23, 2021, my former partner signed a court document that stated that he should not be in any communication with mother and children, which should last until 6pm on 11 February 2022. He started a complaint against me in Spain and on the 1st December 2021, I was attending a hearing of which I was being accused of not allowing him to communicate with his children as ordered by the Spanish court judgment of 2017. However, this was not true as it was proven that the father have been communicating with our children currently and from 2017 During the trial I was interrogated by the Spanish judge whilst the father was absent, I later fainted and the trial was postponed until May 2022. The Spanish court judgment of 2017 stated that the father should make child support payments of â¬300 each. He also stop paying the meagre child support of Â£135 for each child. I have accepted and agreed with the judge in England that mandatory video communication will continue and this has not stopped.</p>
<p><strong>THE INCOMPETENT</strong></p>
<p>As stated, the court in England and Wales found the Spanish court incompetent and now the father's lawyer seek the Spanish cooperation to return us into the custody of the father and seek to do this under Annex IV certificate under Brussels II Revised. At the last trial, held recently on 26 July 2022, the father's lawyer asked the judge to set aside my written domestic violence allegation as it is ""historic"" was his words, but thankfully the judge ignored the statement.</p>
<p><strong>UNSUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS</strong></p>
<p>I just want to give you a recap of the several claims my former partner made against me in court that has no truth to it. Firstly, he stated that the property in Spain was his and he is unable to provide financial documents to show how he acquired the money, despite him owning two flats in the UK and was dependent on my income before and after the children were born. Secondly, he told the court in the UK that I was mentally unstable and I would start behaving erratically and abuse him and the children. Thirdly, he badgered the children into believing that he was only trying to protect them from me whilst on unsupervised video communication which traumatised them repeatedly. Also, he alleged that I contacted one of his siblings from him to gather information that could negatively affect him. That sibling told me what my former partner told him about the abuse and he also revealed other shocking revelations told to him by my former partner. The father's lawyer in the UK instead rebuked and reduced me to being incompetent and untrustworthy and threw out the evidence that was submitted by his sibling of him. The most recent claim is that he is 'Johnny Depp' and I am 'Amber Heard' who is trying to destroy him and attack his credibility. It is him who has defamed and humiliated me through the countless judges that were assigned to this case. I am a private person and kept the years of abuse a secret because I was scared for life and felt helpless. The UK court has failed to protect domestic abuse victims but instead encouraged his disdain towards me in an effort to destroy me completely.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING</strong></p>
<p>I implore you good people out there to assist in any way that is possible because I speak the truth and I do hope that good will prevail despite all the negative claims that have been made against me and my children. Please help us and sign our petition so we can stay in Spain and finally put this traumatic situation behind us because you definitely have not heard most of our horror. The next court hearing is scheduled for September 2022 and I am remaining positive. He has alleged that he is Johnny Depp and I am Amber Heard which has no similarity to our situation because the abuse me and my children endured needs to end. I will once again have no legal representation, but with your help, I am determined to remain strong and persevere.</p>

All the abuse I suffered in England had not prepared me for this kind of fear, I was going to be killed by the children's father. It was as if he had planned it and he truly believed that the Spanish authority would believe him. The officer I was in communication with that night had helped me tremendously. I did not accompany my former partner when he dropped the children off school. I immediately called the police and in very poor Spanish, I cried out for help.</p>
<p><strong>ARRESTED SEPTEMBER 2017</strong></p>
<p>My ex partner returned with my youngest daughter who was still very sick and I took her inside the other part of the property and I locked the door whilst I waited for the Spanish police officer. When they arrived, I quickly came out and I called the friend in Spain, who translated for me and while outside he tried to grab at me and said that he and his partner had a little argument. I did not see it that way and they held him back and handcuffed him at that moment and he was arrested, placed in a cell where he spent a night. Things were never the same, but I tried to ensure that this did not interrupt the plans we had for our children. The Spanish Court awarded me full custody and he decided to get even, when theÂ court awarded me an injunction against him, he broke them many times and no action was taken against him.</p>
<p><strong>ONGOING COURT CASE</strong></p>
<p>He was very disrespectful to the judge, lawyer and the interpreter who was assigned to represent him in Spain. His tone of him was aggressive and he continued to act poorly in a disdainful manner. My former partner was able to successfully attain legal service from the <strong>law Firm Beck Fitzgerald</strong> and in July 2021. With the court hearing only his side of the story, they proceeded. I was accused of kidnapping our children to Spain and that I was the one who was the abuser, with a mental problem. The court in the UK eventually changed the claim to ""retention"" of the children instead. The high court in the UK found the court in Spain incompetent and as such they had jurisdiction from October - November 2017. Despite what happened to me and my children he was never convicted for his crime in Spain and we are still scared because I had completely forgotten that I had recorded the night of 25-26 September 2017. I found this evidence in December 2021. I was forced to represent myself in court in Spain because I could not afford a lawyer nor could I afford a lawyer in England. I was inexperienced and my first and second submission document to the court provided evidence that I am not mental and have never ever been diagnosed as such. It was not until his family became aware of the abuse that I was informed that he was considered mentally incapable and should never have full custody of our children. The first court hearing was on September 23, 2021, I was not in attendance. I made sure that all court documents sent to me thereafter were carefully reviewed to prepare me for the other upcoming court hearing. At the court hearing on September 23, 2021, my former partner signed a court document that stated that he should not be in any communication with mother and children, which should last until 6pm on 11 February 2022. He started a complaint against me in Spain and on the 1st December 2021, I was attending a hearing of which I was being accused of not allowing him to communicate with his children as ordered by the Spanish court judgment of 2017. However, this was not true as it was proven that the father have been communicating with our children currently and from 2017 During the trial I was interrogated by the Spanish judge whilst the father was absent, I later fainted and the trial was postponed until May 2022. The Spanish court judgment of 2017 stated that the father should make child support payments of â¬300 each. He also stop paying the meagre child support of Â£135 for each child. I have accepted and agreed with the judge in England that mandatory video communication will continue and this has not stopped.</p>
<p><strong>THE INCOMPETENT</strong></p>
<p>As stated, the court in England and Wales found the Spanish court incompetent and now the father's lawyer seek the Spanish cooperation to return us into the custody of the father and seek to do this under Annex IV certificate under Brussels II Revised. At the last trial, held recently on 26 July 2022, the father's lawyer asked the judge to set aside my written domestic violence allegation as it is ""historic"" was his words, but thankfully the judge ignored the statement.</p>
<p><strong>UNSUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS</strong></p>
<p>I just want to give you a recap of the several claims my former partner made against me in court that has no truth to it. Firstly, he stated that the property in Spain was his and he is unable to provide financial documents to show how he acquired the money, despite him owning two flats in the UK and was dependent on my income before and after the children were born. Secondly, he told the court in the UK that I was mentally unstable and I would start behaving erratically and abuse him and the children. Thirdly, he badgered the children into believing that he was only trying to protect them from me whilst on unsupervised video communication which traumatised them repeatedly. Also, he alleged that I contacted one of his siblings from him to gather information that could negatively affect him. That sibling told me what my former partner told him about the abuse and he also revealed other shocking revelations told to him by my former partner. The father's lawyer in the UK instead rebuked and reduced me to being incompetent and untrustworthy and threw out the evidence that was submitted by his sibling of him. The most recent claim is that he is 'Johnny Depp' and I am 'Amber Heard' who is trying to destroy him and attack his credibility. It is him who has defamed and humiliated me through the countless judges that were assigned to this case. I am a private person and kept the years of abuse a secret because I was scared for life and felt helpless. The UK court has failed to protect domestic abuse victims but instead encouraged his disdain towards me in an effort to destroy me completely.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING</strong></p>
<p>I implore you good people out there to assist in any way that is possible because I speak the truth and I do hope that good will prevail despite all the negative claims that have been made against me and my children. Please help us and sign our petition so we can stay in Spain and finally put this traumatic situation behind us because you definitely have not heard most of our horror. The next court hearing is scheduled for September 2022 and I am remaining positive. He has alleged that he is Johnny Depp and I am Amber Heard which has no similarity to our situation because the abuse me and my children endured needs to end. I will once again have no legal representation, but with your help, I am determined to remain strong and persevere.</p>
