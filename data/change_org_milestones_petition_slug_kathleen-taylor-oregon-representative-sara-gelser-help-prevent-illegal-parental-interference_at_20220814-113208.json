I had to demand my rights, and it now has to go to court. I'm literally asking the judge to enforce what their father requested and was awarded. I make sure if their father doesn't allow me to talk to them, that I am in contact with their school. \nI think its terrible that this has gone as far as having to go back to court. Its a waste of money on my part, time and energy. He claims they are in danger,then gives no comment to anyone when asked. There are several \"little things\" that are being played here. \nMy youngest has been diagnosed with an attachment disorder due to this chaos. I worry about my kids everyday. They told me that they know I'm \"fighting for them\". This is something a child should never have to say. I gave statistics in my last update. All I'm asking for is fairness for all families. All parents, all children. And for you to continue to sign the petition and share. Its just as important as the others. This is childrens lives. Our future. Next generation. \n\nThank you all. \nSpeak Up For Us @ Facebook\nlilmookie1278@gmail.com\n#ourchildrenaredeserving #familyfairness", "photo": {"id": "160432604", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/1/rc/jl/mRRCJlOsOpdSQJY-800x450-noPad.jpg?1530554230", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "18674579", "createdAt": "2016-12-03T19:37:39.000Z", "title": "MEDICAL NEGLECT? All I want for Christmas is my kids to be healthy and happy", "description": "I was able to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with my boys. I had four fun filled days with them. It was amazing, and I'm so proud to be their mom.  He has now attempted to take them from me again,but this time I stated that I'll request a welfare check if I don't hear from them. I had made several attempts to make plans for this weekend and he ignored all requests. He finally said because I was late dropping them off...but my son was on the phone giving him play by plays of where we were and I was emailing him ( his preference) he then allowed my boys to call me after I made that \" threat\" to him. \nLet's skip ahead..although my children had things to tell me, I encourage them to not let it get them down...things such as what their father tells them, comments about me, etc. Typical bitter ex talk. \nWell my 8 year old has had asthma since he was about 6 months old. Doesn't seem like a big deal right? Just asthma...so common...let's please remember my daughters terminal illness is a lung/heart condition..well he has been using an inhaler since he was about 6 months old, and with that comes what is called a spacer. This is a silicone piece that covers the persons nose and mouth. This is used for him to be able to receive medication effectively. \nI requested that the spacer be sent with us and his inhaler. His fathers response was 'I don't have an extra one for you'. \nIts not for me...its for our son. Asthma attacks are the third leading cause of hospital stays with children and every year more than 40,000 children lose their lives to asthma attacks. To me, that is 40,000 to many. \nI have attached a photo of what I was forced to use as a \"spacer\". He doesn't know how to use the inhaler quite yet without the spacer. In the picture is an actual solo cup, and when he wasn't receiving the medication from his inhaler properly, we used his little hands to make one where he could receive at least a little more and he stated it felt better. The cup was also pushing on his throat. He has a chronic cough. His father refuses to believe he does and tells me its 'only at my house' , but I know he doesn't just get in my car and just starts coughing. My other son says he coughs all day.  He's also made similar, and word for word complaints of what my daughter cimained of before she was ever diagnosed. Its been recommended that he be checked annually for any type of sign for PAH. \nIf anything please help my boys. Possibly prevent a hospital stay or more, and share. This may not seem important, but as a mother, I ask that you please share if anything.

I do have phone contact with my children now, and there are plans for Thanksgiving to have them, so we are hoping the other parent will stick with it. I will not give up until I have my rights back that I deserve. I will not stop until you all have a fair chance at being in your childs life. No reason this shouldn't be taken as important as anything else and a of us have a voice. Whether its yelling from the rooftops or writing in your diary,you're communicating,and that's what we need to do. We are all human. The statistics of these situations will be posted in my group on Facebook Speak Up For Us. You'd be surprised how common alienation and abduction is. Its sad, and it has to stop now! We are in this together. I have taken the lead, I made you all a promise, and mark my word, I am ALWAYS working on this. \nAgain, you all rock! Thank you so much.
