We want Amber Heard REMOVED from Aquaman 2 COMPLETELY.  You clearly have either been sleeping with her or are blind.  It is well known and has been documented that she does NOT have chemistry with a MUCH better actor Jason Momoa.  

The MAIN reason is this:  She LIED not just to YOU gentlemen but to everyone else in this great country!  She told you such falseties that you were ready to believe them and fired Johnny on the spot without allowing him to DEFEND HIMSELF.  The courts have spoken.  A JURY of men and women have found him INNOCENT and were witness to Ms. Heards crimes of her perjury on the stand, her lies.  I ask that you do the right thing and get rid of her and not allow her to continue to use the movie and YOUR reputation and studio as a STAGE on which to project herself as a victime in which she has already been proven as the actual abuser herself.

This petition will have the intention to urge others to boycott the movie once it is released.  Do you think that even the great Momoa would be able to stand that, or even Dolph Lundgren and Nicole Kidman would be able to draw more people and make up for all the people that will  refuse to attend the premieres of the movie everywhere if you continue to keep Mera's momentary role holder?

BOYCOTT AQUAMAN!!","<p>Johnny Depp was proven innocent in a COURT OF LAW.  Amber Heard (moooo) was proven to be the liar and the husband beater that she is.  She claimed that 'she just wanted Johnny to leave her alone'  and that 'she just wanted to be able to move on' and that 'she is now a 'symbol of all women and suvivor'.  Right now she is doing nothing but making people angrier by the day thinking that she speaks for EVERYONE meaning all the gay, straight, transsexual, bisexual, homosexual and everyone I am sure I have missed someone and if so I apologize.  </p>
<p>She continues to spread her lies to this day and uses her PR reps to do it and continue to play the victim and rather than save money for the therapy her daughter will more than likely need as she grows up now, she is even taunting him for joining TikTok which it is none of her business what he does.  He wants nothing to do with her now.  She has not been satisfied with ruining his life and causing him to lose out on his movies he enjoyed working in such as the Pirates of the Caribbean that we ALL love him as Captain Jack Sparrow, and the J.K. Rowling franchise one.</p>
<p>Its her turn to lose out.  We want her to be removed from Aquaman and Aquaman 2.  How can Warner Brothers especially now, turn their back knowing that a SEASONED and well respected veteran such as Johnny Depp who goes and even makes visits to sick kids dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow be overlooked  and compared to someone in favor of Amber Heard that would resort to doing things such as waiting in another seasoned vet's trailer this one being Kevin Costner's, trailer, in the nude in an effort to further herself in the industry??<br><br>PLEASE Warner Brothers --- remove Amber Heard and avoid the risk of losing even more money.  Everyone who signs this petition are vowing to boycott the movie when it is released if not.  She is not that much of an actress anyway.  You make more money with Johnny than with her. Do the right thing. Remove Amber.  Finish where the courts left off and give Johnny the rest of his life back!</p>","Warner Brothers Studios, James Wan, Warner Brothers","Remove Husband Abuser, Proven Liar From AQUAMAN Movies.  BOYCOTT AQUAMAN!!  

We want Amber Heard REMOVED from Aquaman 2 COMPLETELY.  You clearly have either been sleeping with her or are blind.  It is well known and has been documented that she does NOT have chemistry with a MUCH better actor Jason Momoa.  

The MAIN reason is this:  She LIED not just to YOU gentlemen but to everyone else in this great country!  She told you such falseties that you were ready to believe them and fired Johnny on the spot without allowing him to DEFEND HIMSELF.  The courts have spoken.  A JURY of men and women have found him INNOCENT and were witness to Ms. Heards crimes of her perjury on the stand, her lies.  I ask that you do the right thing and get rid of her and not allow her to continue to use the movie and YOUR reputation and studio as a STAGE on which to project herself as a victime in which she has already been proven as the actual abuser herself.

This petition will have the intention to urge others to boycott the movie once it is released.  Do you think that even the great Momoa would be able to stand that, or even Dolph Lundgren and Nicole Kidman would be able to draw more people and make up for all the people that will  refuse to attend the premieres of the movie everywhere if you continue to keep Mera's momentary role holder?  Some people hate to even say her name.    She is NO VICTIM by any means.  

I myself am a victim and I know what a victim looks like and the only thing that woman is a victim of is not finding the right sugar daddy dumb enough to stick around and take her crap.  My mother was one as well.  I was witness to my stepfather shooting her in the shoulder once and I danced the happy dance the day the police shot and killed him in a shootout.

I am pleading with you as are all the others who are signing this petition sirs --- DO THE RIGHT THING!!  Get rid of this parasite before she really does some damage somewhere else down the line and the goddess knows those types will sooner or later and then you will regret not having done what we are asking now.
