All old comments have been deleted, and no new comments are allowed to be made. The petitions have also been removed from the website\u2019s search engine.</p>\n<p>I want to take this time to really clear the air here:<br>What is the purpose of these petitions?\u00a0<br>In my opinion, I personally don\u2019t feel that Ms Heard should be in a position to be a spokesperson or deemed a role model for young women. She really shouldn\u2019t be a spokesperson or role model for anyone.</p>\n<p>But the bottom line, the reason we are fighting this so hard, is for equality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, many who have started these petitions has a love for Johnny Depp. I will not deny that. But to me? If this had been any other celebrity couple, I would still have created a petition.</p>\n<p>Why?<br>For equality, and justice.<br>Domestic violence and abuse has no gender.</p>\n<p>As a woman, it is hard enough to have the guts to come forward and admit that there has been abuse in your relationship.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a domestic violence survivor.</p>\n<p>I know how hard it is. I also know how hard it is to push through the emotional and mental trauma that comes with abuse.\u00a0<br>I know how hard it can be to have to tell people what you\u2019ve experienced, and then having to deal the ridicule and backlash that you can receive after telling your story.<br>And the reality is: most days you don\u2019t want to fight it. You don\u2019t want you have to continue to tell your story to countless people. You just want to bury your head and have it all just go away.</p>\n<p>Most days you don\u2019t the emotional, mental or even physical strength to think about it.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve lived through it.\u00a0I know all too well how hard the battle is.</p>\n<p>But, I have a certain amount of privilege. I can sit here and say I was abused and it is more believable. <br>Why? <br>Because I am a woman.\u00a0<br>Society has forced stereotypes on us. It has made it harder for men to be vulnerable enough to share their experiences with abuse. Then when men do find the courage to speak up and talk about their abuse, they are usually not believed, or they are laughed at for not being \u201ctough enough\u201d. And when there is a woman sitting there, contradicting what he is saying; saying that he\u2019s wrong, and he was the abuser, and he\u2019s lying...<br>Well, that\u2019s called gaslighting.</p>\n<p>It takes a brave soul to come forward and truthfully talk about their most private and intimate details about their personal life. Johnny Depp did this. He got on the stand and told the world, and he was not believed.</p>\n<p>Now, I am not saying I know all the details about what went on in their marriage.<br>I do know this though:<br>I\u2019ve read through enough information from the court case in London. I\u2019ve heard enough of Amber Heard\u2019s recorded ramblings, and heard enough testimony from Johnny Depp and his team to see the similarities between what I experienced, and what really happened between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The blame game, the deflection, stealing of stories, blatant lies, admission of physical abuse, with a sprinkle of gaslighting. This is the abuser.</p>\n<p>The deflection of admission abuse occurred, the hiding, the covering up, not sharing with anyone unless they see it first hand. Covering up to save face, to \u201cprotect\u201d the abuser. This is the abused.</p>\n<p>What we are after here is equality.<br>If Johnny Depp is accused and loses his spokesperson gigs, his movie roles, then the same should go for Amber Heard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If as a woman, I want to be treated equally, then that comes with the good and the bad.\u00a0<br>If I want to be treated equally, then that means I have to agree to see men as my equal in all situations.</p>\n<p>We are at risk of losing our voice here.<br>We need to be heard. <br>We need to be seen. <br>We need people to take their hands out of their pockets and see the big picture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 in 4 women.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 in 7 men.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Those numbers don\u2019t lie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just a fight of Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard.\u00a0<br>Maybe that\u2019s how it started. But now:<br>This is a fight about the abused vs. the abuser.\u00a0<br>This is a fight to have people do what\u2019s right, to open their eyes and realize abuse has no gender.</p>\n<p>Continue to share the link of these petitions. Continue to get our voice out there.<br>We are not going to give up the fight to see this through.<br>We will continue to demand justice.</p>\n<p>We are not going to go down quietly.</p>", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "28032082", "createdAt": "2020-11-08T16:51:37.000Z", "signatureCount": 50000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "28026519", "createdAt": "2020-11-07T15:44:12.000Z", "signatureCount": 40000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "28023495", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T23:15:20.000Z", "signatureCount": 35000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27755521", "createdAt": "2020-09-20T11:17:46.000Z", "signatureCount": 30000}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27473151", "createdAt": "2020-08-07T18:24:09.000Z", "title": "What a Time its Been...", "description": "<p>Okay friends, so much as happened in the past month.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trial of JD vs. The Sun that was taking place in London is complete. We are all anxiously awaiting the verdict which is expected sometime in September.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Has everyone been paying attention to it? If you haven't, a wonderful lady by the name of Jeanne Larson, had done an AMAZING job of keeping everyone updated on what took place each day. If you don't know who she is, she is the creator of the \"Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2\" petition that is here on change.org: (<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2</a> <br>If you haven't signed her petition, go do it now. She's almost at 500,000 signatures, and constantly growing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's get real for a second, the testimony provided by Heard and various witnesses is confusing, full of holes, and constantly changed while on the stand. I'm really don't think she could even keep track of what she was saying. The contradictions were endless. Is this really someone we want our children to look up to? Is this really a woman that we want representing survivors of abuse? In my humble opinion: absolutely not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I fully believe in innocent until proven guilty. But reading the court transcripts, the tweets, and the updates of the case of JD against The Sun, her testimony seems to be that of fiction rather than truth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We can't stop now. As someone who believes that all people should be treated equally, it really comes down to this: if we as females want equality, then it needs to come with both the good and the bad. That means, regardless of gender, religion, skin, orientation, if you are accused of doing something wrong, then you should be treated, and have the same repercussions as everyone else, just as much as you should be praised for doing the right thing. If it's okay to cancel contracts, remove endorsements, sever ties, and run a man's name through the mud, for things he \"allegedly\" did, then why is this woman being spared?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get the word out friends:</p>\n<p>L'Or\u00e9al, it's time to step up and take action for what's really going on. Pull the commercials. Pull the signage. Stop the social media posts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's do the right thing.
