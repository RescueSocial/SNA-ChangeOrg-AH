Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist.

Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist.

Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live.

This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim.

One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later.

Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face.

Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist.

This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight.""

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend.

<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight.""

These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight.""

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim.

There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend.

Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim.

The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court.

Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face.

This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim.

These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court.

Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight.""

These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt.

This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable.

This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

""Victim blaming is worldwide common in every country and it is not only done by men, the most blamers are female. They have no empathy with female victims of sexual harassment, sexual torture, sexual mutilation, rape, sexual murder, domestic violence and murder, that is a sad fact. They are helping in a stupid and mindless way the male culprits and criminals."" That is the really shame. The cruel misogyny of women. I will never understand that until my last breath.""

""If the right of a young woman to integrity was really taken seriously, there would be self-defense for women as a subject. Instead, we continue to learn adaptation. ""
-Luisa Francia, feminist German writer

""What are the men good for? ... We women are not sure why the men are there. Honestly, we hardly ever asked ourselves this question. They are there, and there is bad enough. We wonder how we can best escape and survive, but not what they are good for. ""
-Luise F. Pusch, feminist German linguist

""Call it what you want when a man or boy penetretes a girl or woman against her will, I call it rape!""
-Anita Kanitz

Unwanted and teen pregnancy is often caused by forced sex and sexual abuse or even rape! Judging the pregnant girls is not the solution The solution is to help them in the best way!

The best contraception is always to have no intercourse. Men and boys worldwide are using their genitals as weapons against females. In some countries sexual murder cases and war rapes are so high that we can speak from femicide!

Violence, rape, torture and humilation is very common in porns. Porngraphy is the instruction, rape culture the practice!

In 1976 Andrea Dworkin organized demonstrations against the film Snuff in New York, but attempts to start an organization to continue the feminist anti-pornography campaign failed. Efforts were more successful in Los Angeles, where Women Against Violence Against Women was founded in response to Snuff in 1976; they campaigned against the Rolling Stones' 1976 album Black and Blue. The U.S. anti-pornography movement gained ground with the founding of Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media in 1977 in San Francisco, following a 1976 conference on violence against women held by local women's centers. Early members included Susan Griffin, Kathleen Barry, and Laura Lederer. WAVPM organised the first national conference on pornography in San Francisco in 1978 which included the first Take Back the Night march. The conference led to anti-pornography feminists organizing in New York in 1979 under the banner of Women Against Pornography and to similar organizations and efforts being created across the United States. In 1983, Page Mellish, a one-time member of WAVPM and of WAP, founded Feminists Fighting Pornography to focus on political activism seeking legal changes to limit the porn industry. Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon wanted civil laws restricting pornography and to this end drafted the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance.

Sex slavery, child and forced prostitution is common in all countries worldwide.Another debate of the feminist sex wars centered on prostitution. The women in the anti-pornography camp argued against prostitution, claiming it is forced on women who have no other alternatives.[neutrality is disputed] Meanwhile, sex-positive feminists argued that this position ignored the self-agency of women who chose sex work, viewing prostitution as not inherently based on the exploitation of women. Carol Leigh notes that ""The Prostitutes rights movement of the early 1970s evolved directly from the women's movement"", but adds: ""The women's movement in the U.S. has always been ambivalent about prostitutes"". The polarized views of feminists on prostitution have affected their positions on the related issue of human trafficking, which is frequently for the purpose of sexual exploitation, with anti-prostitution feminists taking up the position of abolitionists.

The male legend of the horny girls and women which have many orgasm during intercourses is part of the sexual enslavement of women. Across multiple different studies from the last several decades of research, scientists have consistently observed that between 80 percent of women will not orgasm during sex, and that a further ten percent won’t orgasm at all in their lifetime.
The porn industry and prostitution lives from the lies of played female lust and orgasm.

For example, in one study over 40% of Pakistani men were completely unaware that females could even achieve orgasm. Even in countries like Egypt and were 90 % of all females have undergone cruel FGM and cannot reach lust and orgasm during their whole lifetime, all men are very sure, the females have orgasm during intercourse. This is common in all countries with FGM, the tears and cries of pain are in the sight of men signs of lust. The same sight have many rapists!

""How can we speak about rape culture? There is no culture in rape! Rape is a horrible and heinous crime. Nothing more and nothing less!""
-Anita Kanitz

""Child marriage is a cruel kind of child abuse and child rape, nearly always connected with forced marriages and forced underaged child births. In many cases the victims have al""so undergone cruel FGM. These hate crimes against female childs and underaged girls and very young women must be stopped forever!""
-Anita Kanitz

We are all the change for a better world, we have waiting for!
The enslavement of women and girls since humankind exists, is funded by the enslavement of their bodies and their sexuality. It is funded by rape culture, forced marriages, child marriages, forced child births, forced FGM, paid and unpaid rape in prostitution and pornography, marital rape, sex trade, sex slavery, denied human rigths, education, gender equality and denied contraception and abortion. Denied contraception and abortion means forced childbirths, funding of rape culture and misogyny. The best contraception is to have no intercourse with men.

There’s a large unmet need for contraception worldwide; more than 110 million women globally who want contraceptives but do not have access to them. One third of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended (80 million annually). These pregnancies lead to 20 million unsafe abortions each year with at least 70,000 women—often mothers—dying as a result. Many more, approximately 5 million women, are hospitalized annually from complications as a result of unsafe abortions. Approximately 90% of deaths from unsafe abortions and 20% of other obstetrical deaths could be avoided by increased access to effective contraception for women worldwide.Stop unwanted pregnancies and tell men and boys not to rape and abuse women.

In the United States, among the 62 million women of reproductive age, most (70 percent) are sexually active, fertile and are trying to avoid getting pregnant, yet nearly half of all pregnancies each year are unintended.

Approximately 11% of these women do not use any method currently, and this small percentage of women account for more than 50% of all unintended pregnancies. At current rates, experts estimate that at least half of all US women will experience an unintended pregnancy, and one in three will have an abortion, by age 45.

Every minute, a young woman becomes newly infected with HIV, and the vast majority of HIV infections are sexually transmitted. Women need reproductive health programs to be integrated with HIV/AIDS services, and vice-versa, for improved efficiency and effectiveness in preventing AIDS infection and unplanned pregnancy and improving maternal and child health.

The United States, through PEPFAR – the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – has made an unprecedented commitment to helping create an AIDS Free Generation. Yet, PEPFAR funds cannot be used to purchase family planning commodities, nor are family planning services provided at PEPFAR sites, meaning that women cannot access a full range of contraceptives at the same site where they receive HIV/AIDS testing, counseling, or treatment. Moreover, continued U.S.-funding preferences for abstinence-based programs undermine comprehensive HIV-prevention services, including the provision of condoms.

Tell U.S. leaders that HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs must be integrated with comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services including family planning services for women and girls.

First, well intercourse is NEVER sex for women. Only men experience rape as sexual and define it as such. Sex for men is the unilateral penetration of their penis into a woman (or anything else replacing and symbolising the female orifice) whether she thinks she wants it or not — which is the definition of rape: that he will to do it anyway and that he uses her and treats her as a receptacle, in all circumstances — it makes no difference to him experiencing it as sexual. That is, at the very least, men use women as useful objects and instruments for penetration, and women are dehumanised by this act. It is an act of violence.

As FCM pointed out some time ago, intercourse is inherently harmful to women and intentionally so, because it causes pregnancy in women. The purpose of men enforcing intercourse regularly (as in, more than once a month) onto women is because it’s the surest way to cause pregnancy and force childbearing against our will, and thereby gain control over us.

And thereby gain control over our reproductive powers. There is no way to eliminate the pregnancy risk entirely off PIV and the mitigating and harm-reduction practices such as contraception and abortion are inherently harmful, too. Reproductive harms of PIV range from pregnancy to abortion, having to take invasive, or toxic contraception, giving birth, forced child bearing and rearing and all the complications that go with them which may lead up to severe physical and emotional damage, disability, destitution, illness, or death
Sex is used as weapon, even the crappiest online definition of violence: “behaviour involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something”. Bingo. It fits: Pregnancy = may hurt, damage or kill. Intercourse = a man using his physical force to penetrate a woman.: Intention / purpose: of the act of intercourse = to cause pregnancy.: PIV is therefore intentional harm / violence. Intentional sexual harm of a man against a woman

Hate crimes:

Honor Killings: The United Nations Populations Fund estimates that as many as 5,000 women and girls are murdered by family members each year in so-called “honor killings” around the world. According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, “honor killings” have been reported in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda and the United Kingdom.


Female Genital Mutilation: The World Health Organization estimates that more than 200 million girls and women around the world have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), a traditional practice that involves either the partial or total removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy), the removal of the entire clitoris and the cutting of the labia minora (excision), or the removal of all external genitalia and the stitching together of the two sides of the vulva, leaving only a very small vaginal opening (infibulation). FGM is commonly practiced in various countries in the Middle East and Africa, though it has also been documented in Asia, the United States and Europe. At least 2 million girls every year, 6,000 per day, are at risk of undergoing FGM.

Acid Burning: In some countries, women and girls are attacked with acid as a result of family disputes or rejected sex or marriage proposals. An increasing number of such acid burnings have been reported in Bangladesh, Nigeria and Cambodia. Those who survive are permanently disfigured and/or blinded. Perpetrators of such attacks frequently escape punishment.

Dowry Death: The United Nations Children’s Fund estimates that as many as 17 women were murdered per day when their families failed to make dowry payments to the families of their husbands in India in 1997. In a report presented to the Beijing + 5 Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Government of India indicated a 15.2 percent rise in dowry deaths in 1999.

These are only a few examples of violence that are committed against women and girls every day in countries around the world. Although the manifestation of violence may vary according to the economic, social and cultural context in which it occurs, it is a universal phenomenon that is prevalent in every segment of every society, regardless of ethnicity, race, culture, age, class or country. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that violence is a greater cause of death among women aged 15 to 44 than cancer, malaria and traffic accidents combined.

And now my own shocking experiences with sexual assault and rape culture:

In the following four cases, men and boys have supported me more than women and girls and could really help me.
Unfortunately, many women and girls are usually not helping each other with sexual harassment, rape and stalking. On the contrary! They support, excuse the perpetrators and accuse and terrorize the victims.
If you think you recognize sexual killers, rapists, stalkers and sexual molesters immediately, you commit a momentous error. All the men and boys who harassed, stalked, sexually terrorized  me and tried to rape me were and are  charming, handsome men, popular, with wife, family, children, girlfriends. But those were and are only masks to deceive everyone, in fact they were and are brutal monsters capable of anything. Monsters are not recognizable at first sight, that can confirm all murder investigators and investigators in sexual and stalking crimes. So do not believe the perpetrators, believe the victims, because as many examples of serial killers us are showing until today, so many lives can be saved and many barbaric offenses can be prevented.

These are my shocking experiences:.

First I was and I am a honest girl and woman, hard working at school, High School and Workplace. Goodlooking and with no sexy dresses. A hardworking wife and mother, fighting for women's rights, girls and childrens rights and human rights, for animal rights and for a clean and good environment. I am a very careful person. But inspite of this, I met many psychopaths and evil persons. Nobody is an island of safety and nobody can say, that evil things cannot crosssing the way of life, every day and every time:


The cases I'll describe in more detail!

Here is a short overview!

I was hunted and stalked on the way to school by a traveling salesman from the area of Aachen at the age of 8 to 10 years for two years by the car. Female neighbors who had seen from the window, that a anonymous car was chasing me, said viciously laughing to my shocked old grandmother, that I was a little slut, if that would already start with men and cars, then I would eventually end up on the street prostitution. None of these stupid and vicious women called the police or anyone else to help, though they saw that in my desperation I ran across the fields for my life. This thing ended with schoolmates and my former teacher, who ambushed the offender and expelled him, but I did not get any help from women.

In high school at the age of 17, I was massively harassed, terrorized and stalked by a classmate. There were female idiots in my class who thought I should finally sleep with him, so that calm would enter the class. It was known, that my harasser was an sexual sadist, because he was a great fan of the misogynist films, ""The last Tango of Paris"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Some stupid girls said, that I am an impertinence with my resistance for the whole class. Because of the fact, the stalker had girl friends in the class, it was planned, that these girls should lure me to a party where I would then be put forcefully under alcohol and drugs and he wanted to gang rape me with numerous friendsn, male classmates warned me, from the concerned girls no warning came. And when he tried every day to throw his heavy school backpack on my head for long-distance practice, which could have ended in a hit with serious or fatal injuries, male classmates intervened, some more than mindless girls were very amused over the show and thought that I should see it as casual fun. The help for me came by male classmates and a female subject teacher, one of the few women in my life that really helped me.
Later, when I had started training in another city, he was seen several times with unknown young men in my train compartment, where they passed me with a sneering smile, then another friend of him was one day suddenly in my company canteen, where he was looking menacingly and silently sat down at my table and also my classmate stalker and two male friends threw me one day powerfully an old umbrella from behind in my back in the main station, so that the umbrella broke. So much for the harmlessness of stalkers.

During my first year at the workplace at the age of 18, I became the victim of a rape attempt by a senior colleague. My successful resistance was dismissed as outrageous and unnormal, especially among stupid women who had gone to sleeping around to make carreer, they said if I was thinking to be anything better then the other women. These mindless women bullied me instead of supporting me. I have at that time the support of my boss and a another male collague. For me, it was not surprising that the harasser had an absolutely disgusting porn calender in his office and in my presence he was constantly talking about whether I could compete with these porn stars and show if I have such a figure. My complaints had the loud mocking laughter of the men and the indignation of the absolutely dumbfounded women to say that porn and prostitution were normal and would prevent rapes and only someone who was not right in the head, like me, would be bothered by this porn calender. However, as we learn from the media / criminal cases and crimonological and scientific studies on a daily basis, increasing pornography and prostitution since the sixties has led to worldwide sexual femicide in all countries, especially in Africa, Asia, South America and all Muslim countries/ Arab / Hindu countries. When at the birthday party of my boss a friend of the harasser massively sexually molested me so in that kind that I gave him a hard slap in the face and he wanted to beat me in front of all colleagues who participated with their family in the celebration, it was some men who intervened and helped me. These absolutely totally stupid women on the party said that I was the troublemaker and the wife of the boss had to drive me home to the indignation of the female guests. Mind you, not the harasser, a family man had to leave the celebration, but me. I was bullied for two more years by all horny men and silly women, sleeping around in this authority because of my resilience to the rape and sexual harassment that forced me to quit my civil service.

And when my ex-tenant stalked me at the age of 48 and terrorized to this day, there were very stupid women in the forum for stalking victims who sided with the stalker and called me a liar, and they were totally brainlessfemale friends of the stalker, who have bully me ever with anonymously calls, laughing at the phone and always sending me English-language love-couple reunion hotlines on my birthday and New Year's Eve. No trace of female solidarity, only of mockery and terror. Apparently it makes these stupid women happy to blame and bully the victims not the culprits. They were so silly, that they have not noticed, that my Ex-tenant has make many BDSM revenge porns of them, sending me these porns with anonymous E-Mails, calling all women and girls sluts. No comment to the stupity of these women and girls.

No wonder men around the world consider women for stupid and inferior. As long as women and girls behave so unsolidly and meanly, that will remain so.
If you are female and think you are safe at home, at school or at work, my experiences will teach you a better one!

I would advise all women, girls, and female children to learn self-defense and martial arts instead of learning to be beautiful and docile. Because the day could come when it saves their lives.

Later I deterred all the aggressors by telling them I practiced on a Grapfruit in a self-defense course, how to squeeze out the eyes of male aggressors.

I was stalked and hunted  for two years with a car by a unknown man(a cowardly pervert) as I was a little school girl on my long and lonley school way. I was between 8 and 10 years old. He wanted to abduct me and rape me and perhaps kill me. All the time he cried out of the car, he has a little girl as me at home, I must fear nothing. In the back of his car, so I can see it, he had a notebook with female nude photos.The last time the man chased me with the car and tried to pull me in the car, I slammed the car door from the outside and clamped his arm in the car door and then ran away over fields, fields and scrub where he could not follow with the car. I saw on his hand a ring, he was married. He verbally abused me out of the car, called me a little slut and whore and threatened to kill me. Nevertheless, this behavior has saved me. Although the offender was tall and strong, I escaped. At that time, I was telling everything to my teacher and classmates which were trying to ambush the man to grab him. But he escaped. and was never seen again. What a perverse human pig!

I was bullied and stalked in college and at workplace. I was 17 year old. I got rape threats from a psychopathic classmate (a cowardly idiot). When the classmate sexually insulted and scolded me in front of the whole class, I ripped him with his long hair over a bench and hit him with a ruler until it broke. That gave me respect, because he was a very strong and very tall young man. He had many girl friends all the time, changing them like T-Shirts and laughing about them and called them sluts and whores, but in spite of that, he harassed me. Classmates and a female teacher were speaking some hard words to him, after It told them, that this stalker want to rape me with others and was planing that. He defamed me in the whole school and called me a mad slut. What a heinous human pig! He left the school without passed exame. On a rainy night (I had already left school after passing the exam) he beheaded all the flowers and roses below my bedroom window and trampled all the beds in the garden with his very large shoes. The tracks could be seen the next morning. He made telephone terror together with other unknown guys for many years and drifted around the house at night. Destroyed all the flowers under my bedroom window on the ground floor at night and always showed with threatening looks at my station.

And at the workplace there was a rape attempt by a male boss (a cowardly dumb ass)I was 18 years old.
My supervisor gave me a lot of work unnecessarily, so I sat at it until the evening. When we were alone in the office, he came from behind, took me into a strangle hold and tried to throw me down and take off the sweater. I broke free with elbows and kicks, gave him a chin hook that sent him to the ground and then stepped on him. After that, I escaped. I was very angry because his pregnant wife was in the hospital and he bragged in the office, that he slept daily with another girl, they are all sluts and bitches. This offender was very strong, like a bulldog. I told everything to my other big boss and a male collegague. Both said very hard words to the culprit and threatend him with the police. The offender said, he invited me to a cup of coffee and then I got mad. And to others he said that I was a liar and a slut sleeping around. What a cowardly human pig! But they did not believe him. In spite of this I was bullied and harassed by others, because of that and so I terminated my job after three years for a better one.

I was stalked and harassed by an misogynist ex-tenant (a cowardly asshole) and his entire circle of friends. At that time I was 48 years old. There were damages to property, slander on the Internet, cybermobbing, telephone terror, rape threats and death threats. I got many sadistic rape porns and I was called a slut, which deserves rape. My husband e-mailed the tenant for his outrageous behavior, which then accused us of being liars and stalkers.
My husband reported the tenant on suspicion of terrorism because tenant had the behavior of a terrorist and friendships with very uncanny appropriate people.

I think my ex-tenant is a very dangerous man who is capable of anything. Shortly before moving out, he was seen laughing and taking a gun at the head of his then-female acquaintance in a car below the house. At the same time, my shocked husband informed me that the tenant had bought and shown him a sadistic porn with rape gang bangs and forced anal sex on the same day, saying, that ist the kind women must be treated, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleedings.
I think my ex-tenant is a very dangerous man who is capable of anything.

At the same time, my husband informed me that the tenant had bought a sadistic porn on the same day, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleeding from me. We knew immediately what had happened. During his short thenant-time he had a girl friend and many One-Night-Stands, but in spite of that, he stalked me. And he defamed me in the neighbour hood as woman, that slept around. After the departure of the tenant informed me the mother of a female tenant in the apartment above him that this was probably drugged with drugs, raped and was now blackmailed. Since the female tenant no longer talked to us and then moved out and probably no police turned on, we could unfortunately do nothing. Murder and rape threats to me were signed with Jack from Hell. I got a photo sent from the blowjob with about twelve years old girl, I recognized him on the liver spot and dimples on the chin, on the dark hair and the clothes. And I got anonymous many rape porns with E-Mail with calling me a dumb bitch and prostitute.
From a forum for stalking victims, I and all those who wanted to help me, were bullied out by him and other unknowns within a few days. I was no longer anonymous, because my appearance and my place of residence was described. A pen pal discovered a forum where my tenant bragged that he was going to end the conflict with a woman with a bottle in her vagina, attached with a corresponding cruel X-ray image of such a crime. What a sadistic human pig! My tenant was a very tall and very strong man, when I realized that he was planning something evil when I was home alone one day, I invited my parents and let them park their car somewhere else. He came then and was very angry when I was not alone, he was sweating heavily, claiming that he wanted to pay me the rent cash today and pulled out a bundle of unbelievable many money , which seemed very strange to me. He is a masterful psychopathic liar, and capable of anything that I know to be evil.
There are also frequent incidents (during the rental period and even today after removal of the tenant) with nocturnal shots below the house, nocturnal destruction of a flower bank, flower pots, outdoor lamps, outdoor cameras, motion detectors, garden furniture in the garden, digging plants and stone steps at night Removal of the garbage containers or paper containers at night with removal of the contents, nightly damage to the company car (scratching, loosening the wheel nuts, piercing the tires).And until now we hear unknown men nightly around the house, under the house and the garden. A girlfriend of mine saw unknown foreign men in cars under the house nightly together with her friend, these people were driving always quickly away when they saw my girlfriend and her friend. Apart from the fact that he did not even pay his monthly newspaper and told the newspaper I would pay it.
Again and again, someone unknown goes around the house at night. When I threw hard fruit out of the skylight several times a night and hit the shadow, I heard from the sounds that it was a man.
Since my ex-tenant had intercepted mail from me during his tenancy and spied constantly in the paper container at night in discarded postal items, he came so to the addresses of girlfriends, penpals and colleagues. These people were massively harassed on the Internet and privately with telephone terror, property damages, break-ins and burglary attempts. A female friend of mine, who lived below my house, was molested by a whole unknown Arab clique (there were a burglary attempt and rape threats connected with harassment and telephone terror) until she threatened with the police. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, I saw this man again and again at longer intervals nearby, near the house, in the tram, the tram stop in my neighborhood, my workplace, near my girlfriend's apartment, either alone or together with an unknown man or an unknown woman, either in changing cars with different license plates or without a car. With beard, glasses, sunglasses or without. My son also saw him differently in the car parks near his school. When I saw him once in front of the shopping center of our district in the morning, my imitated photos were gone for 6 weeks. On a vacation and a cure, I had an unknown very big  man at night on the balcony, which was also noticed by others. In addition, we had two private burglary attempts and a break-in attempt in our Austrian apartment and in a cure tried at night an unknown man to invade in my room. When a movie theater we visited, had to be evacuated because of a decaying, stinking dead animal that unknown people had left behind us, my son and his friend saw  our ex-tenant with an unknown woman leaving the cinema. In addition, the ex-tenant repeatedly called me with false identities professionally and privately, so in the presence of my son in December 2015, when I was just was released from a serious tumor surgery from the hospital, my ex-tenant called himself Mr. Unterberg. At the hospital last night, an unknown tall, dark-haired man tried to get into my room, but he was expelled by a fellow female patient. The daughter of a female friend (who herself was exposed to several burglaries and harassment from a group of unknown persons), was gangraped  by unknown perpetrators and made a severely disabled. The perpetrators were never identified.The stalking of another girlfriend (Burglaries, harassment by unknown) was so extreme that she goes with her husband to the police, but the police could not find out everything, in all other cases it was the same. My meaning is, the male police means, that all the women are hysterical and implausible. I think nothing of the thesis that stalker are admirers and are harmless, I think this thesis simply idiotic and stupid and it was probably invented to protect these hate crime.

The unintelligible thing about the whole thing is, all Criminals, Mobbers and Stalkers had spectators, bystanders and helpers and people, which are looking away, also females. How can women and girls in this world be so stupid to be not on their own side?
I have therefore the opinion that the cowardly crimes stalking, bullying and rape are punished as hard as possible and that helpers, bystanders and spectators must be also severely punished.
Bullying and stalking, rape culture should not be more straightforward in the future. In cases where bullying and stalking leads to death or ends with rape, gang rape, sexual torture, murder and suicide, there should be high lifelong imprisonment for all parties, including helpers and spectators.

The female betrayal of female victims is as old as the world. Because of this men worldwide call women dumb and inferior. The female betrayal includes bullying, slander, hate speech, psychoterror, abuse, violence, stalking, participation in FGM, child murder, abortion of female fetuses, femicide, forced marriages, childhood marriages, honor murder, dowry murder, sex murder, sexual torture, acid attacks, witch hunts, sex slavery, rape pornography, forced prostitution. Female treason also means excusing the perpetrators and accusing the victims. This is a worldwide disgrace and must have an end.

Organized hate campaigns are for example bullying with internet harassment and online slandering. Stalking, cyber stalking and bullying,,online stalking, online harassment connected with defamation and identy theft, the enhanced form of bullying has increased alarmingly worldwide and also the cruelty to the victims is very frightening. Many destroyed lives and suicides, especially among children, adolescents, young girls are very much the case. Stalkers are felonies, cowardly, psychopathic, sociopathic, sadistic, brutal and capable of anything. I know that as victims and as a member of a victim organization. It is important to establish support centers for victims, it is important to create very hard for stalker laws with long prison terms. It is important to recognize stalking as a felony and condemn the perpetrators as felons. Stalker lay hands remarkably often on women living alone, young girls, to students, children who are going to school and chat, families with children.
It makes them fun to destroy lifes, it makes them fun to get people to commit suicide, it makes them fun to make people emotionally, professionally and personally broken. This has to end with very hard punishments!

""When good and evil are placed in opposition to one another, good usually triumphs over evil. However, when good and evil make pacts with one another, it is usually evil which triumphs.""

Gang rape: worldwide fun for young men and boys!
The heinous crime ever, because the victim cannot escape!

Gang Rape : Most Brutal Gang Rape Cases in The World

2016 Yuyun Gang Rape Sumatra, Indonesia:

Yuyun Gang Rape Sumatra Indonesia

On 2 April 2016, a 14¬-year-¬old student from a small village in Sumatra, Indonesia was on her way back home from school, when someone pulled her into the forest. There, 14 young men were waiting who allegedly raped and then killed Yuyun.

Her corpse was found naked and knotted. Her offenders were all under 18. They drank palm liquor before they committed the crime.

2012 Delhi Gang Rape:


It was the 16 December 2012 when the 23 year old physiotherpy student Jyoti Singh and her boyfriend were on their way back home from the cinema. Almost simoultaneously in Delhi, a group of six men stole an empty bus. They were driving aimlessly around in the city, when they saw Jyoti and her boyfriend waiting for a bus. The two went in, not knowing that it was not a normal bus, when the six men first beat Jyotis boyfriend up and then brutally raped, tortured and mutilated her.

After that, they tried to pulled out her intestines with an iron rod and threw her and her boyfriend half dead on the road. The act caused a worldwide shock and triggered a debate about sexual violence against women in India and their role in society. People and especially women organised mass protests and demanded to hang the six rapists. Four of them were sentenced to death, but appealed against the judgement. The leader of the group was found hanged in his cell in March 2013. In 2015, one of the rapist got released, because during the time of the crime he was an underage.


2012 Oksana Makar Gang Rape, Ukraine

Oksana Makar Gang Rape

Oksana Makar was only 18 years old, when three young men brutally raped her on 2 April 2012. When she threatened them to report the offence to the police, they choked Oksana until they were thinking she is dead. After that, the three men wrapped the young girl in a cloth, dragged her into a deserted building site and set her on fire. A passerby spotted her and reached out for help.

Oksana died three weeks later due to her heavy injuries. Almost 55 % of her skin was burnt and doctors had to amputate both her feet and the right arm. The case caused a huge public indignation in the Ukraine. All three perpetrators were caught by the police, but two of them quickly got released. The reason: it turned out that they were the sons of high officials of the regional administration.

Oksana’s mother in the meanwhile showed a video of her suffering daughter on the internet. She had the sympathy of the Ukrainians on her side, who donated blood and raised money for Oksana.

Gang Rape and Murder of Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña, 1993, U.S.:

Two teenage girls from Houston, Texas, were gang raped and murdered on June 24, 1993. 15 year old Jennifer Lee Ertman and 16 year old Elizabeth Christine Pena were on their way back home from a party, when they decided to take a shortcut across the tracks to avoid being back at home after the curfew. Here, beer drinking gang members noticed them, captured the girls and raped them several times.

Once the six men realized that the girls could recognize them, they decided to kill them.

Jennifer and Elizabeth got strangled to death and were found four days later in the park. Peter Anthony Cantu, who was the leader of the gang, was executed in August 2010 with lethal injection. It was his brother, who told the police about the crime after hearing that the youngest members of the gang boasted how much fun they had with the girls. Two other gang members got executed in 2006 and 2008. Two of three left persecutors got sentenced to death for lifetime, while the youngest one (who was only 14 years old at the time of the crime) was sentenced to 40 years of imprisonment.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt.

<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>

I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her).

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live.

<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her).

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

739808840,"It is appalling that someone like Amber Heard is still ""working the crowd"" with her false accusations against Johnny Depp.  She is self-serving and was using her relationship with Johnny Depp to advance her own agenda.  This truth can be seen with great clarity, as we have born witness to her scheming ways.  As far as I know, this is a country where men (and women) are innocent until proven guilty.  There is absolutely no proof that any of Ambers allegations against Johnny Depp were true.   The police have thoroughly investigated this matter and found that no crime has been committed.  Johnny's ex's all came forward with their testimony as a testament to his character and integrity.  Amber, in fact, used manipulative and dishonorable methods to put forward a story that is as full of holes as her own feeble mind.  It is my greatest hope that we can, together, keep this unscrupulous person from becoming a part of this important platform.  We simply don't have to ""believe"" every women who cries wolf, do we?  I hope knot!  Just the facts, please!

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later.

<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here.

Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

739791354,Amber Heard likes to say she is part of the#metoo movement. And she is but not by being a victim like she proclaims herself to be. This is a woman who has been arrested for domestic violence. She has  been caught on camera being disrespectful to authorities.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

In his choices of portraying characters that are part of the human shadow in the most original and loving way he has blazed the trail for millions all over the world to develop more self-acceptance, more self-love by helping them access the collective subconscious. He has paid a high price to be able to provide this service in the first place. Part of the price was being in an abusive relationship with his mother as a child which led him to repeat this pattern with Amber Heard for him to recognize and heal it.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>

Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>

Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

She’s racist, abusive to her ex husband, has been arrested for domestic violence against her ex wife, and lied about being abused by her husband in order to try to secure a payout of 50k a month spousal support, all three of his multimillion dollar condominiums, along with many posessions. The court documents are viewable to the public, and I think it’s absolutelt disgusting that after being able to see this, the UN STILL want her speaking on behalf of the people.

In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim.

Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy.

How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>

<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt.

Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court.

How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>

<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>

And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's.

One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later.

Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it.

Her addition to the list of speakers reflects badly on the event and the organizations involved.</p>
<p>When I saw that Amber Heard was scheduled to be a speaker at the 9th Annual Social Good Summit 2018, I was appalled and surprised. The Social Good Summit is an event jointly held by the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, Mashable, and 92nd Street Y. These are organizations that pride themselves on things such as social change, community, human rights, growth, well-being, etc. The Social Good Summit is meant to aid in helping the United Nations achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, which are meant to bring about a better, more humane world. But there is nothing good or ethical about having Amber Heard speak at this event. Below are the many events and criminal acts that make Heard an unsuitable speaker for an event such as this one:</p>
<p>In 2009, Amber Heard was arrested and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence against her then-girlfriend Tasya Van Ree, after a female cop witnessed her grab Tasya's arm and hit her. Amber was not charged due to living out of state, but was told that she could still be charged within a two-year period. </p>
<p>In 2015, Amber plead guilty and was prosecuted for illegally bringing her dogs into Australia, and providing a false immigration document upon entering the country. Amber was given the punishment of a $1000 one-month good behavior bond. Amber later issued a forced apology, but never owned up to her wrongdoing- having offered excuses upon excuses, all of them blaming someone or something other than her own judgement.</p>
<p>In November 2016, Heard was sued by the producers of the film <em>London Fields</em>, a film which she stars in. She was sued for breaching her contract and committing tortious interference. Heard was later sanctioned by a judge for close to $7000 after failing to show up at her deposition for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This year, Amber tweeted out the following tweet which she later deleted, after many deemed it ""racist"": ""Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in hollywood, a few blocks from where I live. Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies and landscapers a ride home tonight."" This tweet perpetuates the pervasive stereotype that Latinos in the United States are only ""housekeepers, nannies and landscapers"". Amber never apologized or owned up to her mistake.</p>
<p>Less than one month ago it was revealed in a court document, that in 2016, Amber's then-husband, Johnny Depp, made the claim in court that she punched him twice in the face. This claim, among many other things, has led many to wonder whether Amber was the actual abuser in their relationship (since she had previously claimed that Johnny abused her). There is a plethora of evidence, actions, and behavior that point to Amber as the abuser- only a few will be highlighted here. One, is her 2009 domestic violence arrest; unlike Amber, Johnny does not have any previous allegations or arrests concerning domestic violence. Abusers are known to re-offend. Two, when Amber filed for divorce on May 23rd, she cited ""irreconcilable differences"", and only came out with the allegations of domestic violence four days later. Three, the allegations came out on May 27th, three days after her and her lawyer sent an extortion letter to Johnny and his lawyer, demanding that Johnny give her what she want in the divorce, or else the allegations would be made public. Four, when police were called to Johnny and Amber's residence, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed, even though Johnny had supposedly thrown an iPhone at Amber, injuring her face. Five, after obtaining the temporary restraining order, releasing photographs and a video to the media (all of which do not prove anything), repeatedly missing her deposition, and submitting evidence, Heard dropped the allegations and the restraining order just days before a hearing was scheduled, that would have allow Amber a permanent restraining order. Heard had previously claimed that she was afraid of Johnny, and yet she refused to proceed with this. This was also after Amber had seen Johnny's evidence list that he was to present in court, which would have allowed him to prove his innocence. Six, during their relationship, Johnny put on a lot of weight, seemed to neglect his personal hygiene, and was always withdrawn and somber looking in public. These are all tell-tale signs of someone in an abusive relationship. Seven, all of Johnny's ex-wives and ex-partners came to his defense when the allegations came out. Just from these events, it can be seen why many believe Amber to be the guilty one. And if that is the case, it would make Amber's recent Instagram photos truly despicable. In one photo, Amber mocks Johnny's altering of the tattoo he had gotten on his knuckles in her honor. She has her fists out displaying her knuckles, with the caption ""No Ink Needed"". In the other photo, Amber is seen wearing a necklace that says ""Happy"". Nothing wrong with that, except the font and color is the exact same as Johnny's necklace with his mother's name on it. Johnny's mother died just a few days before Amber filed for divorce. If Johnny was indeed the victim in this relationship, Amber is no less than mocking and taunting her victim. It can also be said that if Johnny did indeed abuse her and she feared him, she would not be behaving in such a way that would provoke him like this. </p>
<p>After the allegations came out against Johnny Depp, Amber branded herself an ""activist"", even though she herself was arrested for domestic violence and her allegations were never proven to be true. And if Amber is indeed guilty of abusing Johnny, her activism concerning domestic violence would be a lie, not to mention that it is already hypocritical of her to be a domestic violence activist. Many domestic violence survivors have come out saying that they do not want her speaking on their behalf because she is not a victim, she is a perpetrator. We must listen to these people. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced that Amber is an inappropriate person to have at the Social Good Summit because you believe her, or for whatever other reason, I urge you to ask yourselves what makes Amber a good candidate for speaker at the Social Good Summit. I urge you to ask yourselves why you believe her claims, but not Johnny Depp's. Her claims against him were never proven true, even before a judge, and his claims against her were never proven false, as Johnny was never given the opportunity to prove them in court. What makes her claims more believable than his? If his claims are ignored, that sends the message to men that their claims are not worthy. If you allow Amber to speak at this event, it sends the message that you are okay with abuse against men. In this age of #MeToo, you probably wouldn't even think twice about having a man with allegations against him removed from such an event. Do the same for abusive women. How fair is it that Amber gets to make a good name for herself through activism, but because of her claims, Johnny gets dragged through the mud? You are allowing her to continue to do this. </p>
<p>Both men and women are capable of being abusers and predators. In this age of #MeToo we have have seen that both men and women can be victims. Feminism means equality and that means men and women should be treated the same, and both should be given the benefit of the doubt. That is why I looked at every article, every court document, every picture, every video that I could, before deciding who I felt was the guilty one. And ultimately, it is not up to me to decide, it is and was up to the courts. But you have the power to decide, based on information and evidence, whether or not Amber Heard represents something good, whether she is someone you would like to have speak at this event. You can set the example and tell the world that you are not okay with violence against anyone. People like Amber Heard do not deserve a voice, we must silence her and her lies. </p>
