834966836,"As far as I know Iâ€™m definitely convinced Johnny has to get separate hotel rooms while traveling. Whether or not he hit Amber or provoked her in major ways to feel angry and want to hit him, I donâ€™t know. But in their case both parties have testified that they have experienced abuse from each other. And they each have provided evidence (text, photos of each etc) i think they should each correct whatever they need to for the sake of themselves and do that they also donâ€™t carry remnants of the learned behaviors into their next relationships, but I donâ€™t think either of their careers should suffer if they both have hit. If someone lied about the abuse or not, Iâ€™m not sure and I donâ€™t know, I am only goin go off of whatâ€™s there.

The only thing I can say in my own case is that I personally know how Amber feels because Iâ€™ve experienced hostility before from my mother, and at times fight picking or not sympathetic types of attitudes from my father and some similar things before. Probably equally possible that Iâ€™ve experienced some behaviors that easily could have been considered abusive from potential male love interests from afar before, or not entirely aware. I definitely experienced mental emotional abuse and cheating from my ex spouse (2013-2018) and stalking and harassing from my college ex and again possibly likely hostility from afar from other potential love interests, not aware, that werenâ€™t correct. Thatâ€™s as much as I can say for myself concerning my own situation and where Iâ€™m currently at. I donâ€™t know all of the details concerning theirs but I donâ€™t think anyones careers should suffer.",0,0,Event,33129844,0,comment,2022-08-07T13:54:35Z,,1258820557,1258820557,Kathryn,Rabalais,Kathryn,Kathryn Rabalais,Dickinson,TX,US,,en-US,,[],33129844,33129844,I STAND WITH JOHNNY DEPP!!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ #JusticeForJD,2022-04-24T21:51:07Z,,2022-04-24T21:51:07Z,,en-US,['en'],I STAND WITH JOHNNY DEPP!!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ #JusticeForJD,"<p>Iâ€™m sure many of you have been keeping up with whatâ€™s been going on these passed couple weeks &amp; for those who donâ€™t Iâ€™ll give you a little recap.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp has been a phenomenal actor throughout his career. Depp was removed from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean by Walt Disneyâ€™s Company. This unfortunately is due to his ex wife Amber Heard lying and stating that Depp beat her. It has been proven that he has never once abused her in any way, but yet, that she beat on him repeatedly 24/7 putting him not just through domestic abuse but also trauma &amp; mental abuse on a regular basis. This may come as a joke to some, but abuse towards a man or woman is not to be taken lightly. Now that this has come to light, Johnny Depp still has not been redeemed of this false news &amp; itâ€™s completely heart breaking.Â </p>
<p>Amber Heard ruined Johnny Deppâ€™s life as well as his career. Johnny Depp has always been one of the greatest actors ever since he started acting back in 1984 appearing in the iconic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street. This man NEVER disappoints when he makes a movie, so why continue to keep him from doing the one thing he does best?? Act! Why continue to banned him from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise due to false accusations? Because letâ€™s face it, that movie is nothing without him! Please sign this petition to help Johnny Depp get back to what he enjoys and does best. If men get ridiculed for hitting women, and lose their jobs/career, then thatâ€™s exactly what should be happening to Amber Heard. She is currently working on the 2nd Aqua-man and she should have been dropped from that movie and everything else she is working on as that is not fair to let her continue to have her life when she ruined someone elseâ€™s.</p>
<p>We as a community should not allow Amber whom has lied and played the victim to get away with her actions. If the role was reversed we as the people would never allow; that abuse, on a woman. The fact that the creators of Aquaman are still allowing her to play her role as if nothing happen just shows where their ideas on abuse really lie &amp; and how quickly manipulated people can really be by an abuser in which speaks volumes. After all isnâ€™t that the same thing she did with him? Letâ€™s not act like weâ€™ve never been in a relationship where we were manipulated or felt obligated to stay, in hopes to help that person who is clearly fighting a lot of demons, because in reality we feared we would fail them or be a reason for their demise. So we jeopardize putting ourselves in a position where you were stuck between a rock and a hard place even if it meant causing you your happiness, hoping things could change. Jhonny Depp was accused one time which was all it took to destroy his life he created, and if we have to take drastic measures to put a stop to her ridiculousness then thatâ€™s the price sheâ€™s gonna have to pay. You reap what you sow. Â there are partitions out there for all to sign, to have her dropped from the movie if enough of you take the time, 5 mins tops out of your day for a simple signature.Â </p>
<p>Johnny Depp deserves his life back the way it was before Amber Heard came along, because no actor or actress could ever say this man is not an amazing actor. If you were falsely accused of something you did not do, then thereâ€™s proof you didnâ€™t do it and you still were treated like a bad person, wouldnâ€™t you want Justice??</p>
<p>Even if he is not your favorite actor, please sign this petition in honor of helping clear his name and reputation!</p>

<p>Johnny Depp has been a phenomenal actor throughout his career. Depp was removed from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean by Walt Disneyâ€™s Company.

<p>Amber Heard ruined Johnny Deppâ€™s life as well as his career. Johnny Depp has always been one of the greatest actors ever since he started acting back in 1984 appearing in the iconic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street.

Please sign this petition to help Johnny Depp get back to what he enjoys and does best. If men get ridiculed for hitting women, and lose their jobs/career, then thatâ€™s exactly what should be happening to Amber Heard. She is currently working on the 2nd Aqua-man and she should have been dropped from that movie and everything else she is working on as that is not fair to let her continue to have her life when she ruined someone elseâ€™s.</p>
<p>We as a community should not allow Amber whom has lied and played the victim to get away with her actions. If the role was reversed we as the people would never allow; that abuse, on a woman.

You reap what you sow. Â there are partitions out there for all to sign, to have her dropped from the movie if enough of you take the time, 5 mins tops out of your day for a simple signature.Â </p>
<p>Johnny Depp deserves his life back the way it was before Amber Heard came along, because no actor or actress could ever say this man is not an amazing actor. If you were falsely accused of something you did not do, then thereâ€™s proof you didnâ€™t do it and you still were treated like a bad person, wouldnâ€™t you want Justice??</p>
<p>Even if he is not your favorite actor, please sign this petition in honor of helping clear his name and reputation!</p>
