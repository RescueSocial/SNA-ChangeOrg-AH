810500385,"I absolutely support women in film and for directing!! We can change culture to improve lives... One is by supporting women to be equal in the film industry...
The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

- At age 16, took a stand against her school prom denying a same-sex couple entry by appealing to the ACLU

- Has worked with the Art of Elysium since its inception, a charity that brings the arts into the lives of seriously ill children

- Has traveled on Amnesty International research missions to the Mexico border, and brought awareness to Syrian refugees living in camps in Jordan

- Has volunteered for children's hospitals in LA for over a decade 

- Donated millions of her divorce settlement to the ACLU and the LA Children's Hospital 

- Is a women's rights ambassador for the ACLU, and a Human Rights Champion for the United Nations

- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, and Human Rights Campaign

- Spoke at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala

Amber has been an advocate for others, but it's time that people be advocates for her.
To prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED!

809833367,"Amber Heard inspires us!  We support her life, her role in Aquaman 2, her humanitarian work, and any work she has. We support her evidence and public safety to save lives.

Amber is not only powerful as Mera, but she is also an activist for human rights.

She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office.

She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.

She's an inner philanthropist and advocate who should have a voice.

We want to see her in more films, movies, shows, modeling, and work in the entertainment industry. We want to see more equal rights advocacy!

She's a positive influence on us and we should see more of her!

We want powerful women who can be respected and treated equally.

We created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. We want her humanitarian work and leadership to continue... Would you stand up to prevent or stop domestic abuse? The social question is also: ""Would you save her?""

We support Amber Heard's life and her humanitarian work...

Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his followers with coercive control, threats, incited hate, financially, emotionally, and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.

Amber Heard wrote in the Washington Post, as an Ambassador for the ACLU, about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from Depp fans and how she supports rights: ""Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."" 

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman. We should be able to speak out to create change.

We can change culture to improve lives...

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

754935728,"""Be the change you want to see. I will never understand why it is more shameful to be a battered victim than to be a wife-beater. And I will never understand why it is more shameful to be raped than to be a rapist!“
-Anita Kanitz

“They are all innocent until proven guilty. But not me. I am a liar until I am proven honest.”
― Louise O'Neill, Asking For It

“In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure no one listens.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

You MATTER.
Sexual assault is never okay. Although some survivors may stay silent for years before sharing their stories, the act is in no way shape or form acceptable.
In the past, however, the subject seemed to be overlooked. Many women were subjected to being sexually harassed and assaulted by men who felt as though they were in the right and looking to gain positions of power.

Sadly, years went by with a society that would rather brush things under the rug than face these wrongdoings head-on. Without support, even powerful women fell to the silence that follows a sexual assault.

Thus the actual numbers of rapes is much higher than numbers recorded by the police.With the highest reported incident of Rape Crimes, South Africa top the list.

Cruel domestic murder cases:

In memory of the two women, I have well known, which were brutal and barbaric killed by their partners with knives in 2016 and 2018.Two women I knew well, an ex-colleague and a female neighbor with two children, 9 and 12 years old, were brutally slaughtered with a knife, one from the ex-boyfriend, the other from her husband. Domestic violence is not as harmless as many think and often ends fatally. Especially as in these cases, when the women wanted to separate from their partners and death threats were not taken seriously by the environment. In one case, the old mother found the mutilated blood-spattered corpse of the woman, in the other case the completely horrified children. This must finally come to an end, so this violence can not go on.


Germany, December 2016, burned alive by husband:
A 41-year-old man had been detained on suspicion of murder, after he is believed to have set fire to his wife on a street in the northern town of Kiel.

“We think it's clear in this case that malevolence and brutality, both requisites for a murder charge, exist,” said state prosecutor Axel Bieler.

Ambulance crews took the severely burned woman to hospital on a December morning after pedestrians found her on a street on the outskirts of Kiel. She was taken to a specialist clinic shortly afterwards, but later died from her injuries.
Soon after, her 41-year-old husband was arrested.

The man and woman, both originally from Togo, had lived in Germany for around 20 years with permit residency status, police report.

Authorities added that they believe the motive for the crime was a relationship dispute between the husband and wife, who lived separately from one another.

The Kieler Nachrichten reports that he man poured fuel over his wife before setting her alight. Police sources told the newspaper that a “fire accelerant” had been used.

The paper also spoke to witnesses who said that the woman ran down the street away from the suspect as flames rose from her body. Several people attempted to put out the fire, but struggled to do so.

The suspect's trousers also reportedly caught alight. But he was able to put out the flames before fleeing into a nearby industrial area.

Police say they are questioning several witnesses in order to establish the course of events.

India, May 2018, burned alive by husband and In-Laws:

Woman Burnt Alive By Husband And In-Laws, The Reason Shocks You!

Back in 2004, there were many dowry atrocities on women. In-laws and husband used to harass woman both mentally and physically for dowry. After several thousands of woman deaths, the law became very strict.

Seems, history is repeating.

Three years after her marriage, a 23-year-old woman was allegedly burnt to death by her husband and in-laws in Bengal's West Midnapore district allegedly as she failed to bring more dowry and she had dark complexion skin.

Dowry Harassment!
Shrabani Maity, who was from Chakmokrampur in Kharagpur, was admitted at Midnapore Medical College & Hospital, where she breathed her last in May.

Police arrested Saurabh Maity, the deceased woman's husband, and mother-in-law Sumitra Maity who belongs to Chakmakrampur village in Kharagpur area after Shrabani's death based on her father's complaint.

""Her family members are alleging that she was burnt alive because of her dark complexion. The investigation is still on and we are trying to find out whether she was actually killed because of her skin color or not,"" Kharagpur ASP Y Raghubanshi said.
Shrabani had given birth to a girl child in March this year and cops said they are trying to find out whether this was the reason behind her killing.
""My sister was tortured by husband and her in-laws who demanded more dowry for the last three years after her marriage. We had given a substantial amount of dowry but their demands continued. They demanded more money,"" claimed her elder brother Sushanta Bera. Shrabani had a one and half-year-old child.

Shrabani's father Nitai Bera allegedly claimed that her in-laws poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. ""We have filed a complaint with police,"" Sushanta Bera, the woman's brother added.

""We have started investigations into the matter and arrested two persons,"" said Superintendent of Police (West Midnapore) Alok Rajoria.

Demanded Dowry To Compensate For Her Complexion!The incident has sent shock waves in her locality as her neighbors demanded stern action against her in-laws and husband.

""It was an arranged marriage and initially everything was all right. But after a few months, they started beating her up over trivial issues. They also demanded dowry to compensate for her complexion,"" said the victim's father, Netai.

""Yesterday (on Monday) afternoon we got the news of her death from the neighbors. We rushed to the hospital to see her lying there with burn injuries all over her body. Kerosene had been poured over her. We want stern action against her in-laws and husband. They killed my daughter brutally,"" he added.Seems, her husband started disliking her skin color after ""three years of marriage"". Didn't he see the skin color at the time of marriage?

So, this guy realized her skin color after three years and after having baby. People are not fools to believe this. Dowry laws are very strict and once there is proof, no one can save them. Saying about skin color is one good trick to escape from the law.

However, there are some idiotic women who are misusing this law and filing false cases on their in-laws. And the real needy ones are suffering a lot.

Guys, what is your reaction towards this? What do you think of the real reason, skin color or dowry or giving birth to a female infant? Share us in the comments. Dowry harassments are growing these days very rapidly. This guy killed his wife after 10 days of marriage.

""Her family members are alleging that she was burnt alive because of her dark complexion. The investigation is still on and we are trying to find out whether she was actually killed because of her skin color or not,"" Kharagpur ASP Y Raghubanshi said.
