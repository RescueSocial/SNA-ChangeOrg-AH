In advance, thank you. May good things come to you soon! :-) 

WILLIAM J. LEMATTY IS WRONGFULLY CONVICTED & EXCESSIVELY PUNISHED OVER 24 YEARS!

FACTS PROVING HIS INNOCENCE (-- see more evidence by links in petition)! : 

No fingerprints on the murder weapon from William.

No gun powder residue on William's hands from the murder weapon.

Nobody claimed William murdered anyone, not one eyewitness in or out of trial.

One eyewitness, Karen Eckman, wrote in letters William did not do it, and that Jeremy Brown did.

Over 20 bullets from the murder weapon were recovered from Jeremy Brown, from his personal possession. They were recovered from Jeremy after he fatally shot himself in presence of a police officer arresting him.

Why is he not released yet? The victim's family and friends have links to the Parole Board demanding he remain in prison from anger and not these facts. This means social politics keeps him excessively imprisoned. Historically we did not know this and William has consequently been without enough people support. You can sign this petition to show your support for William's release.
