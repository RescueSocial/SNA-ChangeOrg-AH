StarterPetitionUpdate,25584286,2020-01-11T00:07:08.000Z,"Political Action in Placer County in the upcoming election March 3, 2020","<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It's been some time since the Whitehawk II Development was approved.  Since then, another development was approved called Sunset Area Plan.  As usual, there were other alternatives not fully considered by the Placer County officials.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to make real change and get our voices heard in the upcoming election for Placer County District 4 Supervisor on March 3, 2020.</p>
<p>Below is a posting introducing a candidate that is running and with all of the support of the community, we will unseat the incumbent.  Your support is much appreciated.  Please visit the website and follow the campaign on Facebook (links below).  Together, we can make a change!</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Suzanne Jones for Placer County Supervisor</strong><br>""I am Suzanne Jones and as a resident of District 4, I would like to see a balanced approach to development and planning for roads, water and other infrastructure and to ensure the fair investment of our tax dollars. I’ve decided to run for Placer County Board of Supervisors for District 4 in the March 3, 2020 Election. My goal is to ensure broad community representation and transparency in the important decisions affecting our community.</p>
<p>A press release has been prepared and will be released shortly and I will be hosting several meet and greets where you can share your concerns and hear about a candidate that would like to represent you. You can also visit my webpage at:<a href=""http://suzanne4supervisor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://suzanne4supervisor.com</a> and follow me on Facebook at: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Suzanne-Jones-for-Placer-County-Supervisor-2147352652146660/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/Suzanne-Jones-for-Placer-County-Supervisor-2147352652146660/</a> I am anxious to hear from everyone in the community and would love to meet each and every one of you.
