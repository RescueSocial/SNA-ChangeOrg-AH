We found out today from the district committee over school renovation that Edgemont and Peruvian Park Elementary will be at Crescent Middle as two separate schools, because Bell View Elementary isn't big enough for Peruvian Park by itself nor Bell View and Edgemont together. So during the 2021-2022 school year Edgemont will be at the Middle School. Although that means they will be bussed, they did listen to our concerns and will try to address them. Thank you again for your support.</p>", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "25500763", "createdAt": "2019-12-17T23:37:54.000Z", "signatureCount": 100}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "25498578", "createdAt": "2019-12-17T16:37:14.000Z", "title": "Revision of our petition to stay in our neighborhood school", "description": "<p>Thank you for signing our petition. I wanted to make you aware of a change due to miss leading information. The 6th reason, stated that a parent spoke at the council meeting on December 3rd. It was miss leading, because we found out today they spoke as a parent not a spokes person for the school. We have revisited that statement without the opinion of the parent.
