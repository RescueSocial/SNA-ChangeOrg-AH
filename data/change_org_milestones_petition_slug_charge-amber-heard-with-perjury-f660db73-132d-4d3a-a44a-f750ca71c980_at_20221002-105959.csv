<p>Evening everyone! It seems the calls for justice may be answered. Twitter decided I was a ""bot"" and now I can only share the petition with my own post, not as replies. So it is even more important to share this with as many people as possible and encourage them to sign. We are nearing the end of the trial. Let's see this through.</p>",,,,

StarterPetitionUpdate,30548820,2022-05-13T20:37:27.000Z,Update!,"<p>Thank you for all the support in signing! Though it isn't 1m signs, anything helps send a message. It isn't over yet. The trial resumes after the weekend. I believe the truth could't be clearer. After the jury's decision, Amber should be held be charged with Perjury, especially if and when Jonny wins the trial. Celebrities get away from consequences all the time! We cannot continue to have their special treatment be the norm. To end, <strong>thank you all! Please share the petition as much as possible!</strong> Lets see where it goes...</p>",,,,
