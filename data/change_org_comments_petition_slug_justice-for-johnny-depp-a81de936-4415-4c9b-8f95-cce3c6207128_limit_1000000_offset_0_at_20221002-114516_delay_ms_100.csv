833296563,"We don't want to use the term ‘harassment.’ What is happening today is sexual terrorism.
A strong woman stands up for herself. A stronger woman stands up for everyone else.
Anita Kanitz, trade unionist
 
""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.""
-Albert Einstein, German-born theoretical physicist
 
“Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It shouldn’t be that women are the exception.”
“Every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is, although we didn’t have a name for it.”
“Feminism is the notion that we should each be free to develop our own talents and not be held back by man made barriers.”
-Ruth Ginsburg,  American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in 2020.
 
We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as in the media daily is shown with many cases and examples, of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, gang rapes, sexual harassment and sexual murder, femicide, FGM, child and forced marriages,dowry murder and witch hunts on the social media and so and so on.

Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.

And the worst thing worldwide is victim blaming:
I can't hear these constant victim accusations and non-stop abuser apologies anymore. If you think only men blame female victims, think again. Often the women with accusations are even more extreme and insulting. Who hasn't had that happen to you, you become a victim of catcalling on the street, other women say, my God you're sensitive, you just don't listen. Or your classmate, colleague, boss sexually harassed you, many women scream right away, honestly, you didn't provoke them, men don't do it for no reason. A female relative is beaten up badly by her husband, often with children, most women scream right away, yes, this woman deserves it, she and her children must be cheeky. A female friend is gang raped, female sympathy, non-existent, they say, honestly, doesn't she look like a slut and doesn't she deserve it? A woman is being stalked, women are immediately screaming in chorus, yes, you must have had an affair with the guy, it's your own fault, otherwise he wouldn't be so fixated on you... And so on and so on..

End this nonsence  and this hate against women, girls and female childs forever, that is a shame for the whole male humankind and in the future when Herstory is written, the humans in the future can read about the crimes and the shame of the male human apes.",0,0,Event,33082821,0,comment,2022-05-31T05:36:50Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],33082821,33082821,Justice for Johnny Depp,2022-04-20T21:19:03Z,,2022-04-20T21:19:03Z,2022-04-20T22:00:03Z,en-US,['en'],Justice for Johnny Depp,"<p>As we know Johnny Depp has been FALSEY ACCUSED of domestic abuse by Amber Heard.

Johnny Depp deserves justice for Amber Heard ruining his life and making him relive traumatic childhood and adulthood abuse, none the less having it broadcasted to the world and taking everything he has worked for in his career away. We stand with Johnny Depp and want to seek justice for him. Every production company, brand and sponsorship that has assumed him to be this “monster” should publicly and personally apologize for stripping him of any new possibilities whether it be from them or future companies. #IStandWithJohnnyDepp</p>",,Justice for Johnny Depp,,,,US,,,,,,,justice-for-johnny-depp-a81de936-4415-4c9b-8f95-cce3c6207128,published,,,False,False,,False,,[],True,False,,6575,6575,0,1330,88,0,5,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226556765,photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-400x400-noPad.jpg?1650489545,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-400x225-noPad.jpg?1650489545,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1650489544,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1650489545,False,1600,900,photo,1262207220,1262207220,Danielle,Hanna,Danielle,Danielle Hanna,,,US,,en-US,,[],20,1654340804,1,1653739998,3,1654683281,2,1653869754,21,1655504950,42,1655154869.166,4,1661970907.065,5,1653210903.263,1,1652808298.264,7,1654547832.115,13,1654421059.6,7,1654340576.831,[],False,False,False,Danielle Hanna,Justice for Johnny Depp,Justice for Johnny Depp,active,7500,226556765,photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-400x400-noPad.jpg?1650489545,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-400x225-noPad.jpg?1650489545,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1650489544,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/7/td/ql/mvTdQlNhXbBfzVd-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1650489545,False,1600,900,photo,87.66666666666667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Johnny Depp has solid evidence against Amber that she abused him for years. This petition is to make light of a double standard situation. A woman in power accusing a man in power of heinous allegations that are FALSE, yet she faces no consequences for her allegations and actions. Abuse has no gender and every abuser regardless of gender should be held accountable to the same standard by the law.
