831911975,I was in a situation years ago where my ex spouse was mentally and emotionally abusive for most of our marriage. He cheated repetitively and I had very few ways out and of getting away so I stayed in that situation for a long time. While no physical abuse happened I do carry some anger and after that and I’ve physically been in situations altogether where I’ve had to worry about my safety after that and so I know what it’s like to constantly feel like have to protect myself physically. Not only that but I had a family member pass that was a victim of domestic violence and she didn’t make it out from that. I don’t know the full story between Johnny Depp or Amber heard but it would really interest me to know exactly  what was going on and for info to be reliable rather than making wild guesses.I take situations like that very seriously now after that.,0,0,Event,21911248,0,comment,2022-04-11T13:09:03Z,,1258820557,1258820557,Kathryn,Rabalais,Kathryn,Kathryn Rabalais,Dickinson,TX,US,,en-US,,[],21911248,21911248,File criminal charges against people that falsify evidence in domestic violence cases,2020-05-02T04:20:57Z,,2020-05-02T04:27:52Z,,en-US,['en'],State of California : File criminal charges against people that falsify evidence in domestic violence cases,"<p>I am a survivor of a long term abusive relationship.

""Victim blaming is worldwide common in every country and it is not only done by men, the most blamers are female. They have no empathy with female victims of sexual harassment, sexual torture, sexual mutilation, rape, sexual murder, domestic violence and murder, that is a sad fact. They are helping in a stupid and mindless way the male culprits and criminals."" That is the really shame. The cruel misogyny of women. I will never understand that until my last breath.""

""If the right of a young woman to integrity was really taken seriously, there would be self-defense for women as a subject. Instead, we continue to learn adaptation. ""
-Luisa Francia, feminist German writer

""What are the men good for? ... We women are not sure why the men are there. Honestly, we hardly ever asked ourselves this question. They are there, and there is bad enough. We wonder how we can best escape and survive, but not what they are good for. ""

""Call it what you want when a man or boy penetretes a girl or woman against her will, I call it rape! Why do people call it worldwide rape culture, there is no culture in rape. Call it sexual terrorism, because sexual, women hating religious and social terror and violence worldwide is terrorism.""

We are all the change for a better world, we have waiting for!
The enslavement of women and girls since humankind exists, is funded by the enslavement of their bodies and their sexuality. It is funded by rape culture, forced marriages, child marriages, forced child births, forced FGM, paid and unpaid rape in prostitution and pornography, marital rape, sex trade, sex slavery, denied human rigths, education, gender equality and denied contraception and abortion.Denied contraception and abortion means forced childbirths, funding of rape culture and misogyny. The best contraception is to have no intercourse with men.

There’s a large unmet need for contraception worldwide; more than 110 million women globally who want contraceptives but do not have access to them. One third of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended (80 million annually). These pregnancies lead to 20 million unsafe abortions each year with at least 70,000 women—often mothers—dying as a result. Many more, approximately 5 million women, are hospitalized annually from complications as a result of unsafe abortions. Approximately 90% of deaths from unsafe abortions and 20% of other obstetrical deaths could be avoided by increased access to effective contraception for women worldwide.Stop unwanted pregnancies and tell men and boys not to rape and abuse women.

In the United States, among the 62 million women of reproductive age, most (70 percent) are sexually active, fertile and are trying to avoid getting pregnant, yet nearly half of all pregnancies each year are unintended.

Approximately 11% of these women do not use any method currently, and this small percentage of women account for more than 50% of all unintended pregnancies. At current rates, experts estimate that at least half of all US women will experience an unintended pregnancy, and one in three will have an abortion, by age 45.

Every minute, a young woman becomes newly infected with HIV, and the vast majority of HIV infections are sexually transmitted. Women need reproductive health programs to be integrated with HIV/AIDS services, and vice-versa, for improved efficiency and effectiveness in preventing AIDS infection and unplanned pregnancy and improving maternal and child health.

The United States, through PEPFAR – the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – has made an unprecedented commitment to helping create an AIDS Free Generation. Yet, PEPFAR funds cannot be used to purchase family planning commodities, nor are family planning services provided at PEPFAR sites, meaning that women cannot access a full range of contraceptives at the same site where they receive HIV/AIDS testing, counseling, or treatment. Moreover, continued U.S.-funding preferences for abstinence-based programs undermine comprehensive HIV-prevention services, including the provision of condoms.

Tell U.S. leaders that HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs must be integrated with comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services including family planning services for women and girls.

First, well intercourse is NEVER sex for women. Only men experience rape as sexual and define it as such. Sex for men is the unilateral penetration of their penis into a woman (or anything else replacing and symbolising the female orifice) whether she thinks she wants it or not — which is the definition of rape: that he will to do it anyway and that he uses her and treats her as a receptacle, in all circumstances — it makes no difference to him experiencing it as sexual. That is, at the very least, men use women as useful objects and instruments for penetration, and women are dehumanised by this act. It is an act of violence.

As FCM pointed out some time ago, intercourse is inherently harmful to women and intentionally so, because it causes pregnancy in women. The purpose of men enforcing intercourse regularly (as in, more than once a month) onto women is because it’s the surest way to cause pregnancy and force childbearing against our will, and thereby gain control over us.

And thereby gain control over our reproductive powers. There is no way to eliminate the pregnancy risk entirely off PIV and the mitigating and harm-reduction practices such as contraception and abortion are inherently harmful, too. Reproductive harms of PIV range from pregnancy to abortion, having to take invasive, or toxic contraception, giving birth, forced child bearing and rearing and all the complications that go with them which may lead up to severe physical and emotional damage, disability, destitution, illness, or death
Sex is used as weapon, even the crappiest online definition of violence: “behaviour involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something”. Bingo. It fits: Pregnancy = may hurt, damage or kill. Intercourse = a man using his physical force to penetrate a woman.: Intention / purpose: of the act of intercourse = to cause pregnancy.: PIV is therefore intentional harm / violence. Intentional sexual harm of a man against a woman

Hate crimes:

Honor Killings: The United Nations Populations Fund estimates that as many as 5,000 women and girls are murdered by family members each year in so-called “honor killings” around the world. According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, “honor killings” have been reported in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda and the United Kingdom.


Female Genital Mutilation: The World Health Organization estimates that more than 200 million girls and women around the world have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), a traditional practice that involves either the partial or total removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy), the removal of the entire clitoris and the cutting of the labia minora (excision), or the removal of all external genitalia and the stitching together of the two sides of the vulva, leaving only a very small vaginal opening (infibulation). FGM is commonly practiced in various countries in the Middle East and Africa, though it has also been documented in Asia, the United States and Europe. At least 2 million girls every year, 6,000 per day, are at risk of undergoing FGM.
FGM is nearly in all cases connected with the male hate crime child and forced marriage and with marital rape, child rape, sexual torture and murder and forced often deadly underaged childbirths.

Acid Burning: In some countries, women and girls are attacked with acid as a result of family disputes or rejected sex or marriage proposals. An increasing number of such acid burnings have been reported in Bangladesh, Nigeria and Cambodia. Those who survive are permanently disfigured and/or blinded. Perpetrators of such attacks frequently escape punishment.

Dowry Death: The United Nations Children’s Fund estimates that as many as 17 women were murdered per day when their families failed to make dowry payments to the families of their husbands in India in 1997. In a report presented to the Beijing + 5 Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Government of India indicated a 15.2 percent rise in dowry deaths in 1999.
If the husband dies earlier than his wife, she is in great danger to get against her will a Sati. That means forced by the familiy of the husband and burnt alive with the dead husband.

These are only a few examples of violence that are committed against women and girls every day in countries around the world. Although the manifestation of violence may vary according to the economic, social and cultural context in which it occurs, it is a universal phenomenon that is prevalent in every segment of every society, regardless of ethnicity, race, culture, age, class or country. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that violence is a greater cause of death among women aged 15 to 44 than cancer, malaria and traffic accidents combined.

And now my own shocking experiences with sexual assault and rape culture:

In the following cases, men and boys have supported me more than women and girls and could really help me.
Unfortunately, many women and girls are usually not helping each other with sexual harassment, rape and stalking. On the contrary! They support, excuse the perpetrators and accuse and terrorize the victims.

These are my shocking experiences:.

First I was and I am a honest girl and woman, hard working at school, High School and Workplace. Goodlooking and with no sexy dresses. A hardworking wife and mother, fighting for women's rights, girls and childrens rights and human rights, for animal rights and for a clean and good environment. I am a very careful person. But inspite of this, I met many psychopaths and evil persons. Nobody is an island of safety and nobody can say, that evil things cannot crosssing the way of life, every day and every time:


The cases I'll describe in more detail!

Here is a short overview!

I was hunted and stalked on the way to school by a traveling salesman (a heinous pervert) from the area of Aachen (car from AC) at the age of 8 to 10 years for two years (1963-1965) by the car. Female neighbors (stupid cows without brain) who had seen from the window, that a anonymous car was chasing me, said viciously laughing to my shocked old grandmother, that I was a little slut, if that would already start with men and cars, then I would eventually end up on the street prostitution. None of these stupid and vicious women called the police or anyone else to help, though they saw that in my desperation I ran across the fields for my life. The last time this pervert chased me with the car on my lonely long way to school, the only way to save myself to being dragged into the car was by pinching him in the car door. He then shouted after me death threats as I fled across the fields.This thing ended with schoolmates and my former teacher, who helped me, but I did not get any help from women.This hunt with the car lasted two years. This cowardly child molester was always waiting at that time for me in the car on the my lonley way to school.
An end to this horror made my teacher at last, who, together with other affected children, boys, lay in wait for the perpetrator on the school way, asking him, what he are doing there. The sex predator escaped and was never seen again.

In high school at the age of 17 (1972-1973), I was massively harassed, terrorized and stalked by a classmate (a sexually sadistic hater of women, RF). There were female idiots (Stupid geese that never had a brain) in my class who thought I should finally sleep with him, so that calm would enter the class. It was known, that my harasser was an sexual sadist, because he was a great fan of the misogynist films, ""The last Tango of Paris"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Some stupid girls said, that I am an impertinence with my resistance for the whole class. Because of the fact, the stalker had girl friends in the class, it was planned, that these girls should lure me to a party where I would then be put forcefully under alcohol and drugs and he wanted to gang rape me with numerous friendsn, male classmates warned me, from the concerned girls no warning came. And when he tried every day to throw his heavy school backpack on my head for long-distance practice, which could have ended in a hit with serious or fatal injuries, male classmates intervened, some more than mindless girls were very amused over the show and thought that I should see it as casual fun. The help for me came by male classmates and a female subject teacher, one of the few women in my life that really helped me.
Later, when I had started training in another city, he was seen several times with unknown young men in my train compartment, where they passed me with a sneering smile, then another friend of him was one day suddenly in my company canteen, where he was looking menacingly and silently sat down at my table and also my classmate stalker and two male friends threw me one day powerfully an old umbrella from behind in my back in the main station, so that the umbrella broke.And one night, neighbors heard an unknown motorcycle. The next morning all the flowers and bushes under my bedroom window on the ground floor were destroyed, and since it had rained we found huge footprints that matched the size of my school stalker's body. So much for the harmlessness of stalkers.

During my first year at the workplace at the age of 18, I became the victim of a rape attempt by a senior colleague (a perverted sex offender, AM). When his wife had a childbirth in the hospital, he kept me busy until one evening until we were alone in the office and then attacked me from behind with a stranglehold to rape me. I was able to free myself and send him to the ground with a chin hook and escape. The next day, I told my boss and a work colleague who warned him. However, my training only continued because I had committed to remain silent and that should cause me serious problems. My successful resistance was dismissed as outrageous and unnormal, especially among stupid women who had gone to sleeping around to make carreer, they said if I was thinking to be anything better then the other women. These mindless women(brainless and moreless female ducks) bullied me instead of supporting me. I have at that time the support of my boss and a another male collague. For me, it was not surprising that the harasser had an absolutely disgusting porn calender in his office and in my presence he was constantly talking about whether I could compete with these porn stars and show if I have such a figure.My complaints had the loud mocking laughter of the men and the indignation of the absolutely dumbfounded women to say that porn and prostitution were normal and would prevent rapes and only someone who was not right in the head, like me, would be bothered by this porn calender. However, as we learn from the media / criminal cases and crimonological and scientific studies on a daily basis, increasing pornography and prostitution since the sixties has led to worldwide sexual femicide in all countries, especially in Africa, Asia, South America and all Muslim countries/ Arab / Hindu countries. I got into a fight with a female supervisor who accused me of spreading lies about innocent fathers and I shouted back whether this company was a company or a brothel. She never forgave me for that and I never apologized for that, why I should also apologize for the sex offenders in the company. One day when I brought a portfolio of signatures to an office, three older men were sexually grabbing at me who had daughters at my age. Since I fled the office without signatures, my female boss's deputy angrily asked them that they must be ashamed to harass a young girl. My female boss then threatened her with the notice that she would be fired, if she interfered here. In desperation, I went to the works council, which also had a daughter at my age. But he laughingly offered me his sexual services and penis, that would solve my problem. I fled the office and had one more enemy.When at the birthday party of my boss a friend of the harasser massively sexually harassed me so in that kind that I gave him a hard slap in the face and he wanted to beat me in front of all colleagues who participated with their family in the celebration, it was some men who intervened and helped me. These absolutely totally stupid women on the party said that I was the troublemaker and the wife of the boss had to drive me home to the indignation of the female guests. Mind you, not the harasser, a family man had to leave the celebration, but me. I was bullied for two more years by all horny men and silly women, sleeping around in this authority because of my resilience to the rape and sexual harassment that forced me to quit my civil service after 3 years (1973-1976).

My brother-in-law and half-brother (a great misogynist violent and perverse bastard) of my husband, the super-bully:
I was only 18 years old at the beginning of the endless terror by this women hater (1974-1986) .
My brother-in-law (FK), a wealthy and successful independent businessman, with mansions, houses at home and abroad, mobbed and terrorized everyone, invariably. He was also still a domestic violent offender, who abused my first sister-in-law and his two children daily and he is always unpunished. Above all, he humiliated my husband without end. He stopped at no one. From the beginning my brother-in-law terrorized me, harassed me and called me with vulgar sexist names like stupid slut, silly bitch, frigid virgin. He always claimed that he had seen me in the city at night, especially in the red light district, with strange men, one time he was brought to lie because I was in bed in my parents home at the time with a dangerous pneumonia. My parents wanted him to see him never anymore because of these heinous lies. At another time, when I was supposed to get an good apprenticeship at the tax office, he made a telephone call there, pretended to be my husband, and claimed that I was pregnant. I didn't get the job because of this great lie. He was obviously afraid that his machinations as tax consultants would be discovered by the tax office, which are probably not quite in order, because how do you become so rich as a tax consultant. That was just one of many intrigues against me. But he also used the bank accounts of my husband and my mother-in-law as a tax advisor and took money, there was only no report about that, because my mother-in-law threatened with suicide, if my husband and I were going to the police. The brother of my husband boasted in the presence of all acquaintances and relatives of homicide and rape of indios made by him and his men in South America, where he had haciendas in Paraguay and Uroguay and he had also sex with female minors in Brazil and Florida. His first wife found evidences. We think today that he had at that time connections to people, involved in human trafficking and arms smuggeling. My mother-in-law had great fear and always said to me I should shut my mouth about that, otherwise it could be uncomfortable for me. All people at that time were silent, nobody was going to the police and I was a underaged girl and later a very young woman. If only one person went with me to the police to tell about this evil man, but they all were afraid, very afraid. My brother-in-law forced his first wife to have three abortions in just one year and beat her daily during her two pregnancies, and the second wife had to get sterilized abroad at the age of 25 because he hated children. Whenever we had family reunions, he always came too late, we were not allowed to start drinking coffee until he came, otherwise he was raging. His wife and children always came with blow marks, he constantly insulted me with sexually disgusting comments. I'm a very quick-witted and courageous person, I think, but I've been nearly assaulted by him on several occasions because I objected and stopped him to hit his children and his wife on the coffee table. In one case he wanted to beat the children and his wife at the birthday table of my mother-in-law before my eyes. I intervened and he said he like beating a bitch like me. After everyone was dumbfounded and trembling with fear, I said, go ahead, I've always wanted to use the bonecrusher trick from my judo course on a living subject. And another time, he said to my mother-in-law's old girlfriends that such women as me he would meet otherwise only in brothels. Yes, I said, it has been rumored that you are the main customer in our city brothel, there was now a syphillis epidemic. The two old ladies were trembling all over and snow-white. After a short time there was no contact with my brother-in-law until today. He verbally and physically terrorized and mistreated his female employees, a father of a underaged trainee complained to me that his daughter had almost committed suicide, I could only point out that he must contact a lawyer and police, what else couldnot done. The brother of my husband deceived and decimated all his business associates and friends. They all complained to me and my husband too about this. Although my brother-in-law also humiliated my second sister-in-law (a silly goose with the brain of a bale of straw), among other things he called her his young free hooker to third parties, she bullied hard. She terrorized the young female employees in my brother-in-law's tax advice office; he was verbal, physically violent, and sexually harassing the girls and women. She regularly slandered me, I couldn't even answer at the telephone when she called because she was telling at once lies about my hello at the phone. She said then, she thinks a strange man was in my house, how stupid my husband is, my husband has horns like a bull, because this little slut (me) is cheating him. She also bullied my brother-in-law's daughter and my old mother-in-law, apparently she had nothing else to do but spin intrigue. It is really a shame how such women support perpetrators.At the end, the old parents were on the line, first my very ill father-in-law, whom the brother of my husband accused in the hospital of being a simulant and that he was a case for the psychiatry. When I intervened, he terrorized my mother-in-law, telling her to ban me form visting the ill old man. He did not achieve that. When my father-in-law died, he bullied my seriously ill mother-in-law, along with his second wife, who had just married him for the money and was a true luxury female. He humiliated my first sister-in-law and the children endlessly with his second wife. As my mother-in-law and her twin sister told me, before the divorce, they caught my second sister-in-law and my brother-in-law having sex in a toilet in a luxury restaurant while my first sister-in-law was still in the restaurant with the children. My second sister-in-law immediately after the divorce made sure that the children came out of the house as soon as they were of legal age. She said about me, that I would always look like a ""catching a men"" woman and a around sleeping slut. That says that woman who has sex in a local toilet with a married man, my brother-in-law. As an female acquaintance of my first sister-in-law told me about my second sister-in-law, that this woman is damned calculating, because when she had a fight with my brother-in-law, she told this acquaintance in confidence that the man was disgusting and humilating and bad in sex, but her mother had said to her "" lie down , close your eyes and think of all the money we have then. ""Obviously, this tactic worked. When my mother-in-law, whom we cared for on her own, as well as for my father-in-law, although my brother-in-law had five minutes his office and his house, became ill during our vacation, a female neighbor asked my brother-in-law for help. That was a goddamn mistake, because he pushed the poor old neighbour woman when he came almost down the stairs, screaming in rage, and my mother-in-law was forced by him and my sister-in-law to pack her things and the poor old woman was leave with their suitcases in tears from my second sister-in-law in the doorway of a retirement home. In the meantime, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and playful grandson have looted my mother-in-law's account, along with the cleaning lady, sharing the most valuable stamps and coins from my father-in-law's collections, jewelry, and elegant clothing. When we got our mother-in-law out of the old people's home, the disaster had already happened. My mother-in-law threatened suicide if we went to the police. So she died completely broken in another modern retirement home, because it turned out that she had severe Alzheimer's. Before, my brother-in-law wrote two bad letters, we could take care of her now, he declines any responsibility. Since 1986 my husband has no contact any more with this heinous brother. Well, evil exists, right.

I am stalked and harassed by an misogynist ex-tenant (a cowardly sadistic and sexually perverse asshole, AF) and his entire circle of friends. At the beginning I was 48 years old. The terror is lasting for 17 years (2004-until now), I cannot believe that, but it's true. There were damages to property, slander on the Internet, cybermobbing, telephone terror, rape threats and death threats. I got many sadistic rape porns and I was called a slut, which deserves rape. My husband e-mailed the tenant after he moved out for his outrageous behavior, the stalker then accused us of being liars and stalkers.
There are really female and male idiots worldwide who find stalking women and girls funny. Although stalking is a vicious and extremely cowardly crime. There are now countless cases of group stalking and witch hunts around the world, especially online. But also privately the women and girls are downright harassed by groups, whether on campus, at school, or by acquaintances of the perpetrator at every turn, everything is possible and largely unpunished.
I would never have thought, although I have been in several organizations for women, girls, children and victims' rights and am committed, that I would be affected one day. After all, by the time it caught me, I was already 48 years old and the stalking continues to this day, probably precisely because I'm a committed person and, above all, a woman.
When my husband was looking for a tenant for the student apartment at the time, we noticed that the rental advertisement in the University of Stuttgart was constantly being torn down and that foreign men called me during the day to ask whether the apartment was still vacant, including my ex-tenant. I had a very bad feeling so that I was against to give this man a apartment near us. However, since I was about to go into hospital and have surgery, my husband rented to this man against my advice and my discomfort. That had extremely bad consequences for me and everyone around me. From today's perspective, I think that it owes it to a careless female Austrian pen friend who, which I did not know, was also stalked and in whose hometown the ex-tenant has relatives and acquaintances, must have annoyed these people. Since she had put up photos of me in the house, hung up my full address with telephone number, etc. and was affected by several serious break-ins and stalking, every normal person can imagine why I was and am suddenly in the sights of stalking.
Right at the start of the rental I was in the hospital for some time and saw the stalker walking up and down in front of the hospital in the evening. He probably got the address through my husband, where he came into the house every day under pretexts, in the next house was his student apartment. In the meantime, letters and parcels for me, address lists disappeared and under the pretext of repairing my husband's computer, it was contaminated with Trojans, spyware and virus and sex mail.
When I got back from the hospital I had a hell of a stalking problem and I was really glad when the stalker moved out after 3.5 months. And my husband was very angry, he said, that this guy visited him daily and was standing in the sitting room in front of my pictures, always saying, that I am so beautiful. Every husband gets angry, if something in this kind happened.
Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the story.
Do you find it funny, for example, when he calls under a false name, why I would have left an environmental organization and joined a women's organization. I have no idea how he got this information.
Or that if I go to a detention party with a female friend, someone calls me that he would pay me back for the party and that the car tires of my friend and her daughter would be stabbed by strangers that night?
Digging out garden plants and stone steps and human shit in the garden is even less fun. One evening my best female friend brought me home and we saw a heavy garden step on the sidewalk below the garden stairs. It takes two strong men to do something like this.
The sexual deepfakes that have been floating around on the Internet since then are also not funny, bad sex contacts and porn sites are linked with my name and that is not at all funny for someone who has been fighting against pornography since 1977. But it now seems to be a male sport of sexual sadists worldwide. For example, recently, the German Green Chancellor candidate Anne Baerboeck was posted by unknown perverts fake nude photos of her on the internet with the headline, ""I was young and needed the money."" Only perverts find this funny. Deepfakes and revenge porn are the new weapon of misogynists and sexual sadists. Unfortunately, these disgusting tail-driven cowards mostly go unpunished. It hits all female people, no matter how old, no matter how prominent, no matter how careful or decent. Misogyny is celebrated and applauded around the world and is not punished. I find that a real disgrace to humanity.

My husband reported the tenant on suspicion of terrorism because tenant had the behavior of a terrorist and friendships with very uncanny appropriate people.
I think my ex-tenant is a very dangerous man who is capable of anything. Shortly before moving out, he was seen laughing and taking a gun at the head of his then-female acquaintance in a car below the house. At the same time, my shocked husband informed me that the tenant had bought and shown him a sadistic porn with rape gang bangs and forced anal sex on the same day, saying, that ist the kind women must be treated, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleedings.

At the same time, my husband informed me that the tenant had bought a sadistic porn on the same day, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleeding from me. We knew immediately what had happened. During his short thenant-time he had a girl friend and many One-Night-Stands, but in spite of that, he stalked me. And he defamed me in the neighbour hood as woman, that slept around. After the departure of the tenant informed me the mother of a female tenant in the apartment above him that this was probably drugged with drugs, raped and was now blackmailed. Since the female tenant no longer talked to us and then moved out and probably no police turned on, we could unfortunately do nothing. Murder and rape threats to me were signed with Jack from Hell. I got a photo sent from the blowjob with about twelve years old girl, I recognized him on the liver spot and dimples on the chin, on the dark hair and the clothes. And I got anonymous many rape porns with E-Mail with calling me a dumb bitch and prostitute.
From a forum for stalking victims, I and all those who wanted to help me, were bullied out by him and other unknowns (mostly female bullies, stupid cows that have forgotten brains somewhere) within a few days. I was no longer anonymous, because my appearance and my place of residence was described. A pen pal discovered a forum where my tenant bragged that he was going to end the conflict with a woman with a bottle in her vagina, attached with a corresponding cruel X-ray image of such a crime. What a sadistic human pig! My tenant was a very tall and very strong man, when I realized that he was planning something evil when I was home alone one day, I invited my parents and let them park their car somewhere else. He came then and was very angry when I was not alone, he was sweating heavily, claiming that he wanted to pay me the rent cash today and pulled out a bundle of unbelievable many money , which seemed very strange to me. He is a masterful psychopathic liar, and capable of anything that I know to be evil.
There are also frequent incidents (during the rental period and even today after removal of the tenant) with nocturnal shots below the house, nocturnal destruction of a flower bank, flower pots, outdoor lamps, outdoor cameras, motion detectors, garden furniture in the garden, digging plants and stone steps at night Removal of the garbage containers or paper containers at night with removal of the contents, nightly damage to the company car (scratching, loosening the wheel nuts, piercing the tires).And until now we hear unknown men nightly around the house, under the house and the garden. A girlfriend of mine saw unknown foreign men in cars under the house nightly together with her friend, these people were driving always quickly away when they saw my girlfriend and her friend. Apart from the fact that he did not even pay his monthly newspaper and told the newspaper I would pay it.
Again and again, someone unknown goes around the house at night. When I threw hard fruit out of the skylight several times a night and hit the shadow, I heard from the sounds that it was a man.
Since my ex-tenant had intercepted mail from me during his tenancy and spied constantly in the paper container at night in discarded postal items, he came so to the addresses of girlfriends, penpals and colleagues. These people were massively harassed on the Internet and privately with telephone terror, property damages, break-ins and burglary attempts. A female friend of mine, who lived below my house, was molested by a whole unknown Arab clique until she threatened with the police. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, I saw this man again and again nearby, near the house, in the tram, the tram stop in my neighborhood, my workplace, near my girlfriend's apartment, either alone or together with an unknown man or an unknown woman, either in changing cars with different license plates or without a car. With beard, glasses, sunglasses or without. My son also saw him differently in the car parks near his school. When I saw him once in front of the shopping center of our district in the morning, my imitated photos were gone for 6 weeks. On a vacation and a cure, I had an unknown very big man at night on the balcony, which was also noticed by others. In addition, we had two private burglary attempts and a break-in attempt in our Austrian apartment and in a cure tried at night an unknown man to invade in my room. When a movie theater we visited, had to be evacuated because of a decaying, stinking dead animal that unknown people had left behind us, my son and his friend saw our ex-tenant with an unknown woman leaving the cinema. In addition, the ex-tenant repeatedly called me with false identities professionally and privately, so in the presence of my son in December 2015, when I was just was released from a serious tumor surgery from the hospital, my ex-tenant called himself Mr. Unterberg. At the hospital last night, an unknown tall, dark-haired man tried to get into my room, but he was expelled by a fellow female patient. The stalking of another girlfriend was so extreme that she goes with her husband to the police, but the police could not find out everything, in all other cases it was the same. My meaning is, the male police means, that all the women are hysterical and implausible. I think nothing of the thesis that stalker are admirers and are harmless, I think this thesis simply idiotic and stupid and it was probably invented to protect these harassment.In this case, of course, I also got calls from unknown women and girls who laughed on the phone or sent love couple hotlinesat my birthday and at Christmas, of course these incredibly stupid girls and women also bullied me away from a forum for stalking victims, in which they defended the perpetrator there , although I was anonymous, after that I was it no longer. The stalking perpetrator sent me BDSM Revenge porn from his female friends with the comment that all women and girls are stupid, worthless sluts. But that was not all: I got ugly dick pics and pics with blowjob sex with underaged girls, what a mess! From his name AF he means that his name means nothing else as the greatest Asshole fucker of the world and his porn mails he calls often Asshole fever. And someone like that is defended by women and girls, ist that still possible?

My ex-tenant has the profile of a sexually and personally sadistic stalker and women and girls hunting predator. This is proven by the extremely nasty incidents, which range from property damage, attempted break-ins, gangstalking, telephone terror to harassment, slander, sexual deepfakes and slanderous, sexually sadistic witch hunts on the Internet.
Harmless looks different. This perpetrator is manipulative, narcissistic and highly dangerous and apparently works with a network of Islamists.
I would like to add a few examples to emphasize the danger.
I haven't been in any social networks since 2005 because I was bullied out in two social networks by female friends together with these friends after they invited me to their network, only after two days with a flood of sexual insults and sadistic porn messages . The same thing happened to me at the end of 2004 in what was then the only forum in Germany for victims of stalking. After two days, I went on my own because after being labeled a liar and revealing my identity, despite the forum's assurances of anonymity. Later I was told that stalkers and their supporters hang around in these forums and that the male administrators, one can hardly believe it as a woman, often show solidarity with the perpetrators.
After I left the forum things really started and people who supported me were threatened, insulted and bullied out.
After the above two experiences, I decided to avoid Facebook and other networks like the plague. However, it was of no use to me because the perpetrators registered me under my name on porn and sex contact sites around the world. Later there were all kinds of pornographic and sexual deepfakes and then I was registered as a prostitution supporter in prostitution customer forums.
The perpetrators probably thought that my age and poor health would make it easy for them.
In 2005, to the greatest horror, a pen pal discovered a post from my ex-tenant in a Bosnian forum, in which he bragged about an X-ray where a woman had been raped with a Coke bottle, stating that he was resolving conflicts with women and that all men had to resolve conflicts , haha. The pen pal complained to the administration but got no answer.
In 2008, another pen pal who was a member of Facebook reported that a gay Chinese Facebook friend of my ex-tenant was found brutally murdered with 34 nails in his head in Sydney. This thing scared him so much that he broke pen pals  friendship with me.
One would think that the Australian police would have checked the Facebook friends of the victim too. If the police has done that, from my point of view the police has overlooked something, something very crucial. Because before my pen pal contacted me, I got porn raw mails that all gays had to be killed, which surprised me because I am not gay. After that I thought my part about the story.
Stalking is a widespread behavior: 30 % of all adults, mostly women and girls, face undesirable, frightening persecution one or more times in their life. In about 10 % of the cases there is physical assault by the perpetrator. Research shows that the victims are mostly former intimate partners or men around them. Warning signs are death and suicide threats, but also the presence of an antisocial, psychopathic personality disorder or substance abuse in the perpetrator. The triggering motive for persecution is the acquisition of information and preparations for a sexual assault. The victim is usually a strange  or nearly strange woman or girl or child who is drawn into the stalker's sexual fantasies. The feeling of power is maintained through the knowledge of the future fate of the allegedly unsuspecting and helpless victim.
Another stalker typology was developed by Boon and Sheridan (2001), who focused on the motivation of stalking and differentiated four forms: ex-partner stalking, stalking out of love, delusively motivated stalking and sadistically motivated stalking. My case is the bag-loving stalker and he still hangs around with impunity as a nice guy next door, so said my pen pals, as a mentor for female students, as a friendly family man, as a supporter of human rights. This is his mask in the stalking theater and nobody has torn it off him. Until it's too late ... 

The unintelligible thing about the whole thing is, all Criminals, Mobbers and Stalkers had spectators, bystanders and helpers and people, which are looking away, also females. How can women and girls in this world be so stupid to be not on their own side?
I have therefore the opinion that the cowardly crimes stalking, bullying and rape are punished as hard as possible and that helpers, bystanders and spectators must be also severely punished.
Bullying and stalking, rape culture should not be more straightforward in the future. In cases where bullying and stalking leads to death or ends with rape, gang rape, sexual torture, murder and suicide, there should be high lifelong imprisonment for all parties, including helpers and spectators.",0,0,Event,21911248,0,comment,2021-05-10T06:21:17Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],21911248,21911248,File criminal charges against people that falsify evidence in domestic violence cases,2020-05-02T04:20:57Z,,2020-05-02T04:27:52Z,,en-US,['en'],State of California : File criminal charges against people that falsify evidence in domestic violence cases,"<p>I am a survivor of a long term abusive relationship.
