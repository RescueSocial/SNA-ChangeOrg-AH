StarterPetitionUpdate,29044138,2021-05-13T10:51:21.000Z,,Amber Heard is an advocate and Save Women's Lives,"<p>Thank you for the support of Amber Heard and to Save women's lives by letting them speak against domestic abuse. Let's make it more acceptable than being told that our 'life has too much drama.' We should make it acceptable to stop abuse of women everywhere and at all levels.</p>
<p>Why is it that when a stranger harms a woman, it causes more of an outcry like Sarah Everard than when it's in their own home or by a partner? <br>Many countries though won't even have any outcries over strangers killing women either. Why not outcry long before?<br>We don't need it to get to that point. It should be before any of that and we should focus on helping female victims long before anything happens.</p>
<p>Your life matters. It should be seen as heroic to speak against abuse and violence of all kinds, especially for other people.</p>","{'id': '225554842', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/jg/yi/fEJGYijgyZUcqAa-800x450-noPad.jpg?1620903083', 'processing': False}}",,
