I can clearly see the Amber Heard has constructed this to gain position in the world and pity in hopes for riches and Glory. This man was married for 14 years and then his wife ever leave him talking about he hit her? NOOOO. People are quite dumb to believe that he would do something like this after no evidence has been shown to clearly prove it. All of a sudden a woman, ONE WOMAN have claimed he's abusive. And many other cases of celebrity abuse more than one person has come forward claiming the same thing. Excuse me but I think Amber Heard should lose her job as an actress. Obviously her attempts at ruining a man's whole career and life just to progress hers is disgusting and I no longer support her or will watch anything she's made!

âThe guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.â

You MATTER.
Sexual assault is never okay. Although some survivors may stay silent for years before sharing their stories, the act is in no way shape or form acceptable.
In the past, however, the subject seemed to be overlooked. Many women were subjected to being sexually harassed and assaulted by men who felt as though they were in the right and looking to gain positions of power.

Sadly, years went by with a society that would rather brush things under the rug than face these wrongdoings head-on. Without support, even powerful women fell to the silence that follows a sexual assault.

Cruel domestic murder cases:

In memory of the two women, I have well known, which were brutal and barbaric killed by their partners with knives in 2016 and 2018.Two women I knew well, an ex-colleague and a female neighbor with two children, 9 and 12 years old, were brutally slaughtered with a knife, one from the ex-boyfriend, the other from her husband. Domestic violence is not as harmless as many think and often ends fatally. Especially as in these cases, when the women wanted to separate from their partners and death threats were not taken seriously by the environment. In one case, the old mother found the mutilated blood-spattered corpse of the woman, in the other case the completely horrified children. This must finally come to an end, so this violence can not go on.


Germany, December 2016, burned alive by husband:
A 41-year-old man had been detained on suspicion of murder, after he is believed to have set fire to his wife on a street in the northern town of Kiel.

âWe think it's clear in this case that malevolence and brutality, both requisites for a murder charge, exist,â said state prosecutor Axel Bieler.

Ambulance crews took the severely burned woman to hospital on a December morning after pedestrians found her on a street on the outskirts of Kiel. She was taken to a specialist clinic shortly afterwards, but later died from her injuries.
Soon after, her 41-year-old husband was arrested.

The man and woman, both originally from Togo, had lived in Germany for around 20 years with permit residency status, police report.

Authorities added that they believe the motive for the crime was a relationship dispute between the husband and wife, who lived separately from one another.

The Kieler Nachrichten reports that he man poured fuel over his wife before setting her alight. Police sources told the newspaper that a âfire accelerantâ had been used.

The paper also spoke to witnesses who said that the woman ran down the street away from the suspect as flames rose from her body. Several people attempted to put out the fire, but struggled to do so.

The suspect's trousers also reportedly caught alight. But he was able to put out the flames before fleeing into a nearby industrial area.

Police say they are questioning several witnesses in order to establish the course of events.

India, May 2018, burned alive by husband and In-Laws:

Woman Burnt Alive By Husband And In-Laws, The Reason Shocks You!

Back in 2004, there were many dowry atrocities on women. In-laws and husband used to harass woman both mentally and physically for dowry. After several thousands of woman deaths, the law became very strict.

Seems, history is repeating.

Three years after her marriage, a 23-year-old woman was allegedly burnt to death by her husband and in-laws in Bengal's West Midnapore district allegedly as she failed to bring more dowry and she had dark complexion skin.

Dowry Harassment!
Shrabani Maity, who was from Chakmokrampur in Kharagpur, was admitted at Midnapore Medical College & Hospital, where she breathed her last in May.

Police arrested Saurabh Maity, the deceased woman's husband, and mother-in-law Sumitra Maity who belongs to Chakmakrampur village in Kharagpur area after Shrabani's death based on her father's complaint.

""Her family members are alleging that she was burnt alive because of her dark complexion. The investigation is still on and we are trying to find out whether she was actually killed because of her skin color or not,"" Kharagpur ASP Y Raghubanshi said.
Shrabani had given birth to a girl child in March this year and cops said they are trying to find out whether this was the reason behind her killing.
""My sister was tortured by husband and her in-laws who demanded more dowry for the last three years after her marriage. We had given a substantial amount of dowry but their demands continued. They demanded more money,"" claimed her elder brother Sushanta Bera. Shrabani had a one and half-year-old child.

Shrabani's father Nitai Bera allegedly claimed that her in-laws poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. ""We have filed a complaint with police,"" Sushanta Bera, the woman's brother added.

""We have started investigations into the matter and arrested two persons,"" said Superintendent of Police (West Midnapore) Alok Rajoria.

Demanded Dowry To Compensate For Her Complexion!The incident has sent shock waves in her locality as her neighbors demanded stern action against her in-laws and husband.

""It was an arranged marriage and initially everything was all right. But after a few months, they started beating her up over trivial issues. They also demanded dowry to compensate for her complexion,"" said the victim's father, Netai.

""Yesterday (on Monday) afternoon we got the news of her death from the neighbors. We rushed to the hospital to see her lying there with burn injuries all over her body. Kerosene had been poured over her. We want stern action against her in-laws and husband. They killed my daughter brutally,"" he added.Seems, her husband started disliking her skin color after ""three years of marriage"". Didn't he see the skin color at the time of marriage?

So, this guy realized her skin color after three years and after having baby. People are not fools to believe this. Dowry laws are very strict and once there is proof, no one can save them. Saying about skin color is one good trick to escape from the law.

However, there are some idiotic women who are misusing this law and filing false cases on their in-laws. And the real needy ones are suffering a lot.

Guys, what is your reaction towards this? What do you think of the real reason, skin color or dowry or giving birth to a female infant? Share us in the comments. Dowry harassments are growing these days very rapidly. This guy killed his wife after 10 days of marriage.

""Her family members are alleging that she was burnt alive because of her dark complexion. The investigation is still on and we are trying to find out whether she was actually killed because of her skin color or not,"" Kharagpur ASP Y Raghubanshi said.

""My sister was tortured by husband and her in-laws who demanded more dowry for the last three years after her marriage. We had given a substantial amount of dowry but their demands continued.

Depp was only featured in the movie for a few seconds and the studio could have recast him before the sequel 2 years later. Instead, those involved in the movie - especially David Yates and J.K.

We have the power to send a signal to Warner Bros. about how we feel as a fan community this November.</p>
<p><br>In 2016, accompanying their divorce filings, Amber Heard filed for a restraining order against Depp and shared her story of physical abuse that had escalated over a period of months. At the time of the report, Depp had already been cast and filmed the first installment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise, was released in November 2016. Depp was only featured in the movie for a few seconds and the studio could have recast him before the sequel 2 years later. Instead, those involved in the movie - especially David Yates and J.K. Rowling - have continued to defend Depp and prioritize his casting over the impact of Heard and other survivors, going so far as to confirm his casting in the third Fantastic Beasts film. Yates went as far as to belittle and undermine Heard while uplifting Depp.</p>
