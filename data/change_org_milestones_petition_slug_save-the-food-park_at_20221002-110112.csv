This petition was created by a great friend of the park and food truck owner Amber from Street Kitchen. Amber has a lifelong connection to the community having grown up here in the Clermont County area. The Clear Mountain Food Park could not thank her enough for her dedication and support of our venue and her willingness to help us fight this fight against the township. Thank you Amber for letting us hi-jack what you started for us and get this out to even more Mountaineers. You are much appreciated!Â </p>,,,"{'providerName': 'WKRC', 'photoUrl': 'https://local12.com/resources/media/1b63cd8d-d8fd-4570-b5fe-c283596901df-large16x9_PENTERTAINMENTDISTRIC.transfer_frame_8062.png?1654917200313', 'description': ""WILLIAMSBURG TOWNSHIP, Ohio (WKRC) - Greater Cincinnati's largest outdoor food park is known for a good time with food trucks, drinks and live music.
