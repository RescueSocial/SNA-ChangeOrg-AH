833495849,"""Stupid male sayings are part of a rape culture!""
Anita Kanitz

Sexual violence is about exercising power. Without exception, all girls and women I know worldwide are affected. Sexual violence is particularly bad in schools, universities, colleges and in the workplace. I was also affected by this and the perpetrators went unpunished. The perpetrators were classmates, superiors, trainers, colleagues, ex-tenants. And everyone had an excuse for them and an accusation for me. That was a long time ago and the sad thing is, nothing has changed, on the contrary, everything is much worse than it was with me when I was young and that is a scandal.
Sexual harassment and violence serve to relegate women, girls, and female children to their place, so to speak, namely standing far below men and boys and unsettling them.
Dealing with sexism and sexual violence is pretty hypocritical, isn't it? This can now also be seen in the fact that it took so long, with a view to e.g. the film producer Harvey Weinstein, that the people in the film business kept their distance from him in the first place. Fundamentally changing something here will take a long time.
And the misery of sexual violence and harassment for girls starts very early:
We also grow up with t-shirts for little girls; then it says “princess” or “sexy” or something. This kind of objectification of women begins in childhood. And so it starts with women becoming the target of sex offenders as early as childhood.
And misogynists are not only male, many of them are female. This women and girls are so stupid to be not on their own side. One example we have seen 2022 in the media wordwide:
The Depp-Heard trial proves that blanket women’s solidarity is a myth!
The trial is a violent backlash to the Me Too movement, and many women have shown themselves to be happily complicit in its misogyny.
What shocked me during this trial, and what had unnerved me years ago with my flatmate, was that so many of the people tearing Heard’s testimonies to shreds were women. On social media, it was women who were dressing up as Heard and ridiculing her recounts of violent sexual abuse. It was two of Depp’s ex-girlfriends who asserted that Heard’s claims were “impossible to believe”, purely because they’d never experienced that violence themselves. It was high profile celebrities – like Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Naomi Campbell – who flocked to Instagram to offer Depp likes and messages of support. “[Women like Heard] are manipulative and cold and they use their very womanhood to play victim,” wrote Ireland Baldwin in one particularly inflammatory post. “I hope Johnny gets his reputation and his life back.”
This wasn’t even a case of “Believe All Women,” regardless of testimonies or evidence. Heard had evidence. She had collected more evidence than many victims of domestic violence are able to. Depp had already been on trial for the allegations and had lost. The trial wasn’t about if he had abused Heard. It was a defamation trial on her right to discuss it. 

Two years previously, Depp had ranted to a friend that Heard was “begging for global humiliation and she’s going to get it.” Looking at the trial in the light of that declaration, as well as the macabre circus around it, is frightening.
This trial was never just about Amber Heard. It was never about how we feel about her as a person. The trial was always about a victim’s right to talk about their abuser in public. Earlier this year, Marilyn Manson sued Evan Rachel Wood for her allegations of grooming and abuse against him during the period they were in a relationship – she at 18 and he at 36. Manson has been a close friend of Depp’s for three decades. 
Now that the jury (who were not isolated from weeks of the same anti-Heard jokes and propaganda that we were subjected to) have declared that her statement was made in “actual malice” and have ordered her to pay millions in compensation to Depp, what does this mean for other cases of domestic abuse? Amber Heard and Evan Rachel Wood are both wealthy, cis, white American women. Thousands of women in similar situations will have seen what happens when women, even in privileged positions, challenge their abuser. 
Lesser still that many of the people fanning the flames of turning a trial around domestic abuse and misogyny into reality TV would be women, many of whom don’t seem to realise the long-term consequences this will have for VAW (violence against women) survivors all over the globe. 

The Amber Heard-Johnny Depp trial was an orgy of misogyny! In text messages to friends, Johnny Depp fantasized about murdering his then-wife, the actress Amber Heard. “I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead,” Depp wrote. In other texts, he disparaged his wife’s body in luridly misogynist terms. “Mushy pointless dangling overused floppy fish market,” he called her.

The texts became public as part of Depp’s defamation suit against Heard, now at trial in a Virginia court. Ostensibly, Depp is suing over a 2018 article that Heard published in the Washington Post, titled “I spoke up against sexual violence – and faced our culture’s wrath.” In the piece, the actress writes, “Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse.” The article does not mention Depp, but his lawyers say that the piece was about him – and was defamatory. 
Last Wednesday, the case’s verdict came in, finding that Heard defamed Depp, acting with “malice,” when she described herself as a victim of domestic abuse. Bizarrely, the same jury found that one of Depp’s lawyer’s defamed Heard when he accused her of staging a “hoax” scene of abuse to which police were called at the couple’s home. The verdict came after a trial that was televized – an extremely rare situation for a proceeding that concerns allegations of domestic violence – and which was subject to almost inescapable media coverage, nearly all of it in favor of one litigant, even as the jury was not sequestered. The strange, illogical, and unjust ruling has the effect of sanctioning Depp’s alleged abuse of Heard, and of punishing Heard for speaking about it. It will have a devastating effect on survivors, who will be silenced, now, with the knowledge that they cannot speak about their violent experiences at men’s hands without the threat of a ruinous libel suit. In that sense, women’s speech just became a lot less free.

Over the past six weeks, as the trial was live-streamed online, many of those who have tuned in to watch have treated Heard with the same contempt that Depp did in his texts. A broad consensus has emerged online that Heard must be lying about her abuse. She has been accused of faking the photos of her injuries from Depp’s alleged beatings, painting bruises on with makeup. She’s been accused of convincing the multiple witnesses who say Depp abused her to lie – repeatedly and under oath – for years. These conspiracy theories are unsupported by the facts of the case, but that has not stopped them from spreading. Online, the case has taken on a heady mythology, and belief in Depp’s righteousness persists independent of the evidence.

In the service of this myth, any cruelty can be justified. When Heard took the stand, she became emotional as she recounted how Depp allegedly hit her, manipulated and controlled her, surveilled her and sexually assaulted her. Afterwards, ordinary people, along with a few celebrities and even brands like Duolingo and Milani, took to social media to mock or undermine Heard. They took screenshots of her weeping face and made it a meme. Many performed mocking re-enactments of her testimony, lip-syncing along as she recounted the alleged abuse. The audio of her crying became a TikTok trend. This cruelty has now been joined in and compounded by the jury, who have gone beyond mocking her for telling her story, and now declared that she actually broke the law by doing so.

This is not the first time Depp has sued over the allegations. In 2020, a British court heard Depp’s lawsuit against the British tabloid the Sun, which Depp sued for defamation after an article referred to him as a “wife beater”. UK courts are much more amenable to defamation claims than American ones, but Depp still couldn’t prevail: the British judge found that the Sun’s characterization of Depp was “substantially true”. That same trial found that Depp physically abused Heard on at least 12 occasions. Yet the actor and his fans claim that it was Heard, not Depp, who was the abuser in their marriage.

The trial has turned into a public orgy of misogyny. While most of the vitriol is nominally directed at Heard, it is hard to shake the feeling that really, it is directed at all women – and in particular, at those of us who spoke out about gendered abuse and sexual violence during the height of the #MeToo movement. We are in a moment of virulent antifeminist backlash, and the modest gains that were made in that era are being retracted with a gleeful display of victim-blaming at a massive scale. One woman has been made into a symbol of a movement that many view with fear and hatred, and she’s being punished for that movement. In this way, Heard is still in an abusive relationship. But now, it’s not just with Depp, but with the whole country, with all misogynists worldwide!

ince she published her Post piece, Heard’s life has been consumed by the rage and retaliation of Depp and his fans. Lost in the scandal and spectacle of the lawsuit has been this reality: it is Heard, not Depp, who has been put on trial, and she is on trial for saying things whose truth is evidenced by the very fact of the lawsuit itself. Depp’s frivolous and punitive suit, and the frenzy of misogynist contempt for Heard that has accompanied it, have done a great deal to vindicate Heard’s original point: that women are punished for coming forward. What happens to women who allege abuse? They get publicly pilloried, professionally blacklisted, socially ostracized, mocked endlessly on social media and sued. Wrath, indeed.

But mainstream coverage of the trial has not seemed to grasp this. Instead, there’s been tremendous focus on Heard’s mistakes and worst moments over the course of her relationship with Depp. As is typical of domestic abuse victims, Heard does seem to have done things many of us would not be proud of. She fought back. Depp’s outbursts and insults left Heard resentful and angry with him, and sometimes, she told him so. Many are quick to point out that Heard is not a perfect victim. But no woman is. We are told that the lawsuit is “complicated.” But the lawsuit is not complicated. It is abuse. Now, that abuse has been sanctioned by a jury.

Maybe the persistence of this notion that Heard is somehow equally culpable for what happened to her is why people like the New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg have characterized the trial as “the death of Me Too”: it shows how easily a victim can still be blamed and isolated, how easily what happened to her can be taken as a failure of her personal character, rather than as part of a social pattern. Not all women are alike, but feminism was supposed to let us see how we are all similarly vulnerable – both to gendered abuse and to the gendered application of double standards and unjust blame. No victim is perfect. No victim should have to be. After all, if a man cannot be considered abusive towards an imperfect woman, then just how perfect does a woman need to be before it becomes wrong to beat her?

For their part, Depp’s fans seem to not so much deny Depp’s alleged violence against Heard, but to approve of it. “He could have killed you,” says one viral Tiktok supporting Depp, the text superimposed over photos of Heard’s bruised face. “He had every right.” The post has more than 222,200 likes.

The backlash to #Me Too has long been under way. Critics of the movement painted women’s efforts to end sexual violence as excessive and intemperate from the start, claiming #MeToo had “gone too far” before it really got under way at all. And yet the Heard trial does feel like a tipping point in our culture’s response to gender violence. The forces of misogynist reaction are perhaps even stronger now for having been temporarily repressed. Where once women refused, en masse, to keep men’s secrets, or to remain silent about the truth of their own lives, now, a resurgence of sexism, virulent online harassment, and the threat of lawsuits, all aim to compel women back into silence – by force.

In some ways, one could see the defamation suit itself as an extension of Depp’s abuse of Heard, a way to prolong his humiliation and control over her. The only difference is that now, the legal system and the public have been conscripted to take part. This seems to be at least partly how Depp sees it. In 2016, as their marriage broke apart, Depp texted his friend Christian Carino, vowing revenge against Heard. “She is begging for global humiliation,” Depp wrote. “She is going to get it.”

And it was a woman that helps the woman abuser to win!Kate Moss leaves Amber Heard as a liar in trial of Johnny Depp. 

From her home in England, the model was questioned by the lawyer Benjamin Chew, who defends the actor in this controversial and media site, about her relationship with him, to which she pointed out that had a romantic relationshipwhich lasted from 1994 to 1998.
The staircase incident, if true, happened years before Depp and Moss eventually split and neither has ever referenced violence as the reason for their breakup. Instead, Depp has blamed stupidity, his work, and youth for their split which Moss said left her crying for ‘years’.

‘I have never got that emotional over a woman before,’ Depp told Hello magazine in 1998. ‘I have been so stupid because we had so much going for our relationship. I’m the one who has to take responsibility for what happened – I was difficult to get on with, I let my work get in the way and I didn’t give her the attention I should have done.

‘The whole thing was crazy because I should never have got so worked up over what people had to say about my work,’ he continued. 'Sure, I should care about my movies but when I get home, I should try to leave that stuff behind. I couldn’t do that, and I was horrific to live with. Trust me, I’m a total moron sometimes.’
Meanwhile, Moss told Vanity Fair in 2012: ‘There’s nobody that’s ever really been able to take care of me. Johnny did for a bit…I believed what he said. Like if I said, “What do I do?” he’d tell me. And that’s what I missed when I left. I really lost that gauge of somebody I could trust. Nightmare. Years and years of crying. Oh, the tears!'
No comment for this! But we should call something like this coercive control!
Domestic abuse isn’t always physical. Coercive control is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.

This controlling behaviour is designed to make a person dependent by isolating them from support, exploiting them, depriving them of independence and regulating their everyday behaviour.

That is not the only case with many tears. Johnny Depp called ex-girlfriend Vanessa Paradis an 'extortionist French cunt in email to Elton John and said she was trying to 'brainwash' their two children: Amber Heard's lawyers unleash barrage of violent messages in blockbuster lawsuit!
That says all about this misogynist, he is a shame for his childs, the childs of Paradis. Who wants a father in this world like this.

Victim blaming and hate speech: Some countries have reacted to this, e.g. France, but Germany has not yet responded.
The other thing I think is incredibly important: How do we deal with people when such a crime has happened.
Because what shocked me to this day is that not only men accuse the victims, but also a damned number of women and girls. Although it should be clear to them that they could also be a victim tomorrow, the probability is high. From my experience, it caught all women and girls at the time who excused these perpetrators and insulted the girls and women as sluts who would have challenged it, much more furiously than the men, these women and girls got excited about Then one day to realize that nobody is an island, it can hit absolutely anyone.

Sexual harassment is a common form of violence against women. Education is particularly important here, because those affected can legally defend themselves.

Sexual harassment ranges from less serious forms such as stare, suggestive remarks, or harassment over the phone or on the Internet, to unwanted sexualized contact, sexual distress, and sexualized physical assault.

Depending on the form, context and extent, sexual harassment can be a criminal offense, for example insulting, sexual coercion or stalking.

Since 2016 there has been a new criminal offense of sexual harassment, which can also be used to punish digging. There is also a new criminal offense when sexual harassment is committed from within groups.
Sexual harassment in the workplace and in training is very common.

The employee survey ""Sexual harassment in the workplace. Results of a representative survey among employees in Germany"" by the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency (ADS) from 2015 showed that 17 percent of the women questioned had already experienced sexual harassment in the workplace according to their own assessment. If you ask specifically about individual situations, the numbers are even higher.

For example, 22 percent of women reported having been asked inappropriate questions sexually related to their personal life or appearance. 19 percent have experienced unwanted physical advances in the workplace. In most cases, the sexual harassment comes from men.

Dependencies are often exploited. For example, women are more often affected by sexual harassment in the workplace if they have no professional qualifications or training, are still in their probationary period or have only been with the company for a short time.

The women affected often feel insecure, devalued and their dignity injured. The consequences of this can be: loss of motivation to work, depression, fear, internal resignation, mental illness. In many cases, these women experience negative reactions when they contact their employer. Therefore, they often play down or withhold sexual harassment out of fear of defamation or job loss.
Protection against sexual harassment in the workplace

Those affected can legally defend themselves against sexual harassment: Protection against sexual harassment in the workplace is regulated by the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) in Germany. According to the AGG, anyone who is sexually harassed in connection with their employment relationship has the right to complain to the responsible offices of the company or the department.
They are obliged to examine complaints and inform those affected of the result. If the employer does not take any or obviously unsuitable measures to prevent (sexual) harassment in the workplace, the employees concerned are entitled to cease their work without loss of pay, insofar as this is necessary for their protection. Before those affected stop their work, they should definitely seek legal advice. Under certain conditions, the employer is also obliged to pay damages.

According to the ADA study ""Sexual harassment in the workplace"", 60 percent of the personnel managers and works councils surveyed are not aware of any measures against sexual harassment in their company. The study also shows that the majority of employers do not have company agreements or comparable regulations that stipulate how to proceed if sexual harassment becomes known.

Sexual harassment in the workplace was made illegal in Australia under the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984.

The EU Directive 2002/73 / EC on the equal treatment of men and women in the world of work recognized sexual harassment as a form of discrimination in 2002. All Member States had to implement them by 2008.

India's 'Law Regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women in the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Compensation)' went into effect in 2013 and stated that women should not be subjected to sexual harassment in any workplace.

In South Africa, sexual harassment in the workplace is prohibited by labor law. Sexual harassment is also prohibited under the 'Protection Against Harassment Act (No. 17)' of 2011.

In other countries, however, there are still (!) No specific laws. These countries include Mali, Mauritania, Cameroon, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

“Bad, but fortunately not an issue for us” - this is what you often hear when it comes to sexual harassment in the workplace. #MeToo still shapes the debates about sexism and equality to this day. But has the world of work really changed - towards a respectful, non-discriminatory working atmosphere in everyday interaction?

There is still a long way to go. Too often, sexual harassment remains a taboo subject in the workplace. That has to change without a doubt, as sexual harassment is an absolute no-go. It makes those affected sick, demotivated - and it poisons the working atmosphere.
Almost every second employee has already observed or experienced sexual harassment. Nevertheless, there are hardly any reported cases; let alone procedure. And even if they do exist, it is usually the victims, the harassed, who in the end leave the company.

The only thing for me and all those affected that I know was dismissal. After the dismissal, the employers concerned organized targeted character assassination in order to make it more difficult to find work. Even after the termination of the employment relationship, there was often still telephone terrorism and harassment with outrageous mail, and refusal of job references. Sometimes the sex offenders persecute the victims from the workplace through stalking after they have been fired or quit.

As long as such conditions prevail worldwide, the alleged equality in many countries is just a damned lie, a fairy tale that is supposed to cover up the true balance of power. Among other things, lower pay with better or equal qualifications for female employees, exploitation of women in the workplace, verbal insults and rape jokes in the workplace,
physical and sexual assault and constant apologies for the male perpetrators and accusations for the female victims.
Or compulsion to be sexually compliant if you want to have a career as a woman in some firms, otherwise you will be bullied out and get such a bad job reference that you will hardly get a job in the future. Male lawyers and judges also have sexist misogynistic slogans in court cases.

We are still a hell of a long way from equality and the real stumbling block is the bullying between women. But men love betrayal, never traitors as these women. When a victim is finished, the female traitor is also hit.
Male humanity is now a master at manipulating women and girls, so equality is just a word.
Women there is a lot to do, we have to change that, because who else can do it if we are not fighting ourselves!",0,0,Event,33172054,0,comment,2022-06-07T18:38:50Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],33172054,33172054,Disney Should Apologize To Johnny Depp,2022-04-28T16:33:54Z,,2022-04-28T16:33:54Z,,en-US,['en'],Disney Should Apologize To Johnny Depp,"<p>Johnny Depp created for Disney one of the most iconic movie characters for their Pirates of the Caribbean series.  Captain jack Sparrow was his baby and when Amber Heard threw him under the bus with her fake accusations, Disney dropped him like a bad habit without having all the facts.

833291276,After the millions and millions of dollars he made for them. They didn’t even give him the opportunity to tell his side before they dropped him. Disgusting. I won’t support Disney in any way. No merchandise no tv shows no films nothing. They owe him a major PUBLIC APOLOGY  and compensation for the films he was removed from. There will no no Pirates of the Caribbean without Depp. This last one will be a flop. Millions will not go to see it and box office will be bad. I also think they should remove any likeness of Captain Jack/Johnny Depp from all attractions and publicity. Innocent until proven guilty.
