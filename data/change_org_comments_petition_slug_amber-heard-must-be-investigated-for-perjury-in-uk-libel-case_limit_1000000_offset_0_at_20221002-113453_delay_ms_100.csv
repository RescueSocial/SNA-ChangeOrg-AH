We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

833386543,"Amber Heard is a narcissistic, vile, disgusting, EVIL, con-artist fraud, and manipulative woman who capitalized on the #metoo movement for her own personal gain.  She intentionally and maliciously ruined the character and reputation of a beloved and innocent man.  She’s an ADMITTED and DOCUMENTED ABUSER - to both Johnny Depp and her sister - who also lied in order to protect Amber.   Paid for witnesses lacking credibility, altered and staged photographs, fake “bruises"", fake dry-eyed crocodile tears, over the top theatrics and outlandish accounts of DV and SV without one solid piece of evidence.  Her narcasssism and arrogance on full display, she thought no one would catch her spinning her web of lies.  LIE after LIE after defamatory LIE!!!  She couldn’t keep her many stories straight for two seconds. This woman should have been in the hospital a million times over, with stitches galore, if any of this had been true - but no, not a Dr. or medical record to be found.  Her face is her business, it would take months to recover from the beatings she “claims” she endured - daily, and over the course of years...yet she's at events and festivals the very next day fresh faced.  She has made a mockery of TRUE DOMESTIC ABUSE VICTIMS around the world!!!  Follow Camille Vasquez's closing arguments, it’a all there, laid out for anyone with a brain to see very clearly, AHeard can’t keep her stories/lies straight.  She’s a con artist and master manipulator who MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERJURY - FOR THE SAKE AND SUFFERING OF ALL TRUE DV VICTIMS - and sadly, all future DV victims.  98% of people around the world agree - and she is the most hated woman in the world right now for a very good reason.  Perhaps making a LEGAL example of AH and her lies will prevent another sick and twisted indivdual from doing the same thing to another innocent person.  We must protect the innocent, and claiming false abuse is far too easy - perjury never goes acknowledged or punished.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job. Please sign this petition if you believe, no matter what race, or gender you are, outlandish lies like this MUST be met with the person(s) being held accountable.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles). The UK judge presiding over that libel suit, Justice Nicol commented in concluding opinions, in regards to her not being a “goldigger” because of her supposed philanthropy regarding donating her divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story. From her ex husband himself and misrepresented his own recounting of that event to suit her own agenda.</p>
<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia. No decision in the past regarding this case can be rectified; we respect the courts as much on that, regardless of how we may disagree with the decision, but we are looking to our authorities to hold Ms. Heard accountable based on the malicious intent to state mistruths as a witness in a libel case, and further them publicly on the stand in a defamation case in the United States with no regard for judicial processes. </p>
<p>We call on the UK justice and court system to do its job.

<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

<p>In the April 11th 2022 defamation case in Fairfax county, Virginia, USA, defendant Ms. Amber Heard took to the stand, and in the course of a lengthy testimony had made false statements in contradiction to the testimony she gave as a witness in the dubiously decided libel case against The Sun in the UK July 2020, where Mr. Johnny Depp was the plaintiff. <br><br></p>
<p>One of her statements in the UK trial as a witness to the defendant; sworn under oath, was that she had donated her $7 million to the ACLU and the CHLA (Childrens hospital of Los Angeles).

<p>This was proven false by the testimony of a representative of the ACLU during the defamation suit against Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>The second false testimony among many is when she stated under oath as a witness for The Sun in the UK libel suit is that she had Kate Moss in mind of a rumour being pushed down the stairs by Mr. Depp as to why she felt compelled to hit him as she feared he would hit Whitney Heard and Whitney would fall down the stairs.</p>
<p>This report was told via a British news outlet of Kate Moss being mentioned as the motive to her striking Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>Not only did Kate Moss herself testify in this case of Mr. Depp suing Ms. Heard; emphatically stating that Johnny Depp has never pushed, kicked, or thrown her down the stairs, we heard from Mr. Depp himself under oath as to where Ms Heard had originally learned that story.

<p>What she continued to do under cross examination, despite Ms. Moss attending to testify by video link to say the contrary, Ms. Heard ‘doubled down’ on the lie, the falsehood, that Ms. Moss had ‘come out the woodwork’ to support Mr. Johnny Depp, insinuating that Ms. Kate Moss had lied under oath (like the other witnesses she accused of lying under oath) to protect Mr. Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The UK justice apparatus has the right, and I believe the duty at the very least to investigate these falsehoods she made on the stand as a witness in The Sun libel case, which was continued AND contradicted by witness testimony in the defamation suit in Virginia.

We call on those responsible to our justice system to at the very least, investigate the statements which were made in contradiction to Ms. Heards testimony as a defendant in the defamation case in Virginia, to the ones she previously made as a witness in the libel case with The Sun.",,,London,GB,51.5081,-0.128005,,,,,amber-heard-must-be-investigated-for-perjury-in-uk-libel-case,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 2173, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'law', 'slug': 'law', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 110}, {'id': 114371, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'accountability', 'slug': 'accountability-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 47}, {'id': 519223, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}, {'id': 545103, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'Perjury', 'slug': 'perjury-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 4}, {'id': 215699, 'locale': 'en-GB', 'name': 'investigation', 'slug': 'investigation-en-gb', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 15}]",True,False,,4294,4294,9,8745,979,2,77,0,0,0,0,,AmberHeardToBeInvestigatedForPerjury,,,,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,1655982644,111,155,1662341493.987,15,1659955640,74,1654920602,1654538780,46,15,1660858610.076,6,100,24,1657117244.077,217,1661977416,1654929342,70,20,1663871117.2,1659621303.472,3,172,1654543521,37,1656706902.173,270,1655975683.583,1657686696.892,16,1656441631,1654377496,78827169,78827169,Marcus,Jones,Marcus,Marcus Jones,Hounslow,,GB,https://www.twitter.com/ezekielbourne,en-GB,Just someone who likes to think for himself.,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 12756452, 'display_name': 'The Crown Prosecution Service', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'The', 'last_name': 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'title': 'CPS', 'id': 12654797}, 'has_email': True}]",False,False,False,Marcus Jones,226654010,photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-48x48-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-128x128-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/3/ap/yw/YTaPyWasWsCnlgT-800x800-noPad.jpg?1653917498,False,800,800,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,Amber Heard MUST Be Investigated For PERJURY In UK Libel Case,active,5000,226650570,photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x400-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-400x225-noPad.jpg?1653768639,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/qo/yj/nbQOyJTBWrWXiCW-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1653768640,False,1600,900,photo,12756452,The Crown Prosecution Service,,Custom,the-crown-prosecution-service-8011694a-4bf2-4c6e-add0-a04d10be3cd9,,,False,,,,,True,The,Crown Prosecution Service,CPS,12654797,True,85.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
