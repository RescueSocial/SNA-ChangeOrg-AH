He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard. Whereas all ex partners for Johnny Depp has shut down such allegations and supported him.</p>
<p>Amber has also lost all credibility as she has lied repeatedly, so much so that cosmetic brand Milani called her out for doing so as she claimed to use a product by then during her marriage to conceal her bruises, however the product only came out more than a year after her divorce from Depp.</p>
<p>Amber Heard started taping Johnny Depp very early on and would only tape his response being frustrated after she instigated arguments and fights. This is a clear indication of her motivation for being in the marriage was money and not love as she subsequently requested rent free access to his penthouses, his car as a form of blackmail to not go public with her allegations. She was then recorded laughing at him saying no one would believe him that he was a victim of abuse because he is a man and she is a woman. She also demanded to be paid off in the millions in the divorce settlement, promising to make sizable donations to 2 charities which was never honored even after she received payments in full by Mr. Depp.</p>
<p>She has not been able to provide any evidence of physical or sexual abuse, however, Johnny Depp has already provided concrete evidence that he was, in fact, the victim.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, the entertainment industry and other media platforms that are used to influence people should and must remove Heard from their existing and future projects. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>
