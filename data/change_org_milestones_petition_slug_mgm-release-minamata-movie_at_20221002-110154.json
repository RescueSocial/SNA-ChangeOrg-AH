You guys are truly, truly incredible. I know I thanked the JFJD community, but I also know that there are others who genuinely want to see the movie to truly understand the crimes that happened to the people of Minamata. We cannot let them bury this, and silence those that suffered Minamata disease, some of whom are <strong><em>STILL SUFFERING</em></strong>!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I believe we can hit 1,500 by the end of the day. That\u2019s the goal I\u2019d like to set for us, anyway. The more signatures we get, the bigger the likelihood of MGM seeing our plea to release Minamata in the US, but we need your help to accomplish this.
