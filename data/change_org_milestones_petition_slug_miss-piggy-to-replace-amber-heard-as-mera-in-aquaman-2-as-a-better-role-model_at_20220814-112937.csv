<p>So many lies already proven to be lies yet the gutter press continue with their own fabrication of the truth.. The Sun who it clearly appears fabricated photos with AH to make out assault then the Daily mail who can not help but keep using lines from Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail as their proof (yet miss the fact that she had just verbally and mentally abused a minor prior to the text messages)TMZ keep claiming copyright of photos that have been out in the public domain for ages before AH sells some to them... Use edit videos to try and sell a false story. </p>
<p>One day the IPSO will actually take control of the media and bring them up to the standards that they are all supposed to adhere to . </p>","{'id': '226619674', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/3/gk/ny/pogKnyZkpnztqft-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652636623', 'processing': False}}",,
StarterPetitionUpdate,30548681,2022-05-13T19:54:27.000Z,,Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman2 passes 4 million...,"<p>A massive shout out to Jeanne and what she has done with her petition. Though started out as a petition to remove AH from AQ2 it has ended up becoming so much more to so many people. Whether a stand against the media and their own stories rather than facts. Whether a stand up for Victims in general. A victim can be any age, and any gender we should remember that first we are Human beings, and we should try and treat others as we would like to be treated. </p>
<p>So well done to Jeanne and the Justice for Johnny Depp community as a whole. Please sign Jeanne's main petition and and lets get that to 4.5 Million and then lets just see where. We can make a difference and out voices are being heard. </p>
<p>Of course if you want to sign here for Miss Piggy as a bit of fun the please do. </p>
<p>Thankyou</p>
