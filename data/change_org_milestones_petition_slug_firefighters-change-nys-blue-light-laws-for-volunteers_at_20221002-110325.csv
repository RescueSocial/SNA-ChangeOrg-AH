StarterPetitionUpdate,25790802,2020-02-23T04:01:19.000Z,,Update to an alternative,"<p>You've seen some videos on YouTube about ""POV's"" and such and wasn't so clear about it. This I am gonna go over a little but if you are scared to have US volunteers to have blue lights with a siren or any other color lights then New York State should allow the ""courtesy Green Light Laws"" I have seen them in this video below where you do not have a siren but they are not your ordinary emergency vehicle. You don't have to pull over but you should and know that we are trying to go out potentially save someone's life. This better helps the volunteers not get picked off for possibly being a ""police impersonator"" just like some would say in New York State that those blue lights on the cover page are illegal (like they are now). We should be allowed any green lights associated with the fire department as we please and will let people know that we are NOT trying to impersonate police officers, we are trying to get to the scene of an accident or any fire alarm and get to the station quickly to help answer the call. I believe green lights are an alternative to blue lights for the police and fire department personnel because of this very reason. We should be allowed to ""trick out our personal vehicles just like the paid professionals but doing it in a manner where it's legal and safe for everyone on the road"". This doesn't give you the right away or permission to go through a red light but would faster response times as well. Whatever light you want volunteers to use, please help sign this petition. This petition will help save more lives every day if we implement new laws on lights.Â </p>",,,
