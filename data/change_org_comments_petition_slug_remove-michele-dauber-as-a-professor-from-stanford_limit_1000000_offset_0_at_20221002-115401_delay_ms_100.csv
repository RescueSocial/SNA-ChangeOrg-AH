She claims to represent or advocate for survivors of domestic abuse and sexual abuse; however, she has cookie cutter, one size fits all idea of what a survivor should be. If a survivor doesn't match this idea, their less than other survivors. Her follows are telling survivors their not ""real"" or that they've never encountered predatory men. Ms. Dauber is posting images of white vans that says free candy. I realize her intent is towards one individual here, but as a survivor of childhood sexual assault, this is triggering. She is also attacking minority female lawyers because of who they represented instead of applauding their achievements. Is this the type of behavior that Stanford stands for? The face of Stanford is full of hate, vitriol, and vengeance towards men, students, and anyone who doesn't met the standard set for survivorship and feminism.

834865199,"Young minds full of anticipation & expectation attend Stanford University. Like seedlings & hanging on every word, thought & tried idea; they fill themselves with information in hopes of one day blooming into self-reliant, productive members of society with hopes of making real differences in the world. However, when doing so, if ideas are taught even slightly slanted or so passively, like a grain at a time, this will effect the chemistry of thought…especially when looking to fit in & belong, especially by an out spoken prof. Would an opposing point of view effect how different members of the student body are seen, graded or would students be by-passed for opportunities because they don’t fit within the realms of her thinking? In a perfect world this question would be a resounding & unequivocally NO! But we don’t live in a perfect world & EVEN if this individual believes that her emotions on this matter are not influencing how she teaches, I can guarantee that this is absolutely not the case, good intentions or not. The passions of teaching run deep as deep as this subject matter, is it possible to keep them separate when she is slandering Mr Depp on social media then attending to class after? Is it possible not to let your own conclusions taint the excellent  work put forth from the University? Take examples from Roe vs Wade…how hard is it for Judges to remain unbiased? Has anyone ever heard a Judge break this rule? Everyone knows the answer to that & I personally have heard of Judges being censured over that subject- in Canada. Stanford keep your higher grade of learning at its best & release this lower grade of teaching away from your students, campus & faculty - make her an example of what you expect when one is employed by your exemplary University.",0,0,Event,33619061,0,comment,2022-08-03T20:34:02Z,,1262234641,1262234641,Cheryl,Greenhalgh,Cheryl,Cheryl Greenhalgh,Winnipeg,,CA,,en-CA,,[],33619061,33619061,Remove Michele Dauber as a professor from Stanford,2022-06-11T14:31:27Z,,2022-06-11T14:31:27Z,2022-06-12T15:02:33Z,en-US,['en'],Remove Michele Dauber as a professor from Stanford,"<p>Michele Dauber, a professor at Stanford University has taken to Twitter to express her discuss for Johnny Depp's lawyer Camille Vasquez.  Although everyone has the right to express their opinions on the outcome of the trial and their opinions of the lawyers for either sides, Michele Dauber has taken it too far!

And now here comes this Woman and is posting those bad and so absolute wrong Things. This is stupid. It clearly seems to me that she is claiming for ""15 Minutes of Fame"". What else would it be though? Sorry, but a healthy Brain would've seen that JD as a MAN is the Victim and should be supported by a Person of her Interest. This is so wrong!!!
