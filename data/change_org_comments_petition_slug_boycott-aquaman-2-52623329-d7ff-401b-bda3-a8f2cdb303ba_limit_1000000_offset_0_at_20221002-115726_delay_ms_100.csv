833039408,"Victims of domestic, sexual, narcissistic, misogynist violence already know what it's about:
A wolf in sheep's clothing? The perpetrator-victim reversal!
""If you go out like that, don't be surprised!""
""What did you expect when you acted like that?""
""Did you say you didn't want that?""
""Men are men, boys are boys.""
""If you had behaved correctly, this would not have happened to you.""
""You're lying, that's a nice boy, a good father, that's not true.""
""Do you have to lie to get attention, how pathetic.""
""Are you sensitive, that was just for fun, normal sex, you are completely unfeminine, frigid, mentally disturbed and abnormal.!""
""You're too fat, too unattractive, too old, men aren't interested in you at all.""
""Do you always have to hang out your breasts, no wonder it only happens to you.""
""I would go to a good psychiatrist if I were you, what you're saying isn't normal.""
""It's only when you act like a slut that you get treated like a slut, decent girls and women don't get that.""
""You provoked the whole thing, otherwise it wouldn't have happened.""
""A decent and good wife doesn't get beaten, you're not even capable of a good marriage, what a shame.""
If I listed all of the victim allegations, I wouldn't be finished by tomorrow. And that's just the usual victim insults and victim taunts that every woman, girl I know and myself have had to endure.
 
Those affected by sexualized violence, especially women, often hear these or similar comments. Whether it's verbal or physical abuse, women often have to justify what was done to them. They are then accused of provoking assault, dickpics or rape themselves. By the way they dress, where they are or how they dealt with the perpetrators.
Catcalling, (cyber) stalking or rape are considered serious offenses, but at the same time many see calculable risks in these acts, from which one must protect oneself. Anyone who doesn't do this, or who supposedly provokes such acts through clothing or appearance, is ""it is their own fault"". According to this logic, the true victims of the crime are the accused perpetrators, because their reputation is damaged. The focus is shifted from the perpetrators to those affected.
 
This process is called ""victim-offender reversal"". The English term ""victim blaming"" is also often used. The guilt and thus the responsibility for the crime is shifted from the perpetrators to those affected.
Role reversal is often done by third parties who doubt whether those affected are actually innocent or whether they are partly to blame. In some cases, perpetrators take advantage of this dynamic themselves.
This role reversal does not only take place in the area of ​​sexualized violence. People who spread hate or disinformation online often complain about supposed censorship and restrictions on freedom of expression when their posts are deleted. That this happens because they violate the guidelines of the platforms or even the applicable law is ignored. The haters present themselves as victims of an “opinion police”, but it is they themselves who endanger freedom of expression: Campact found in a study that 74% of those surveyed believe that hate messages on the Internet intimidate and suppress people.
Some people not only shift responsibilities, but also invent perpetrators to stylize themselves as victims. This happens, for example, when an alleged world Jewish conspiracy is invented to justify anti-Semitic attitudes. From the self-portrayed victim role, anti-Semitic, or even racist or sexist attacks are then legitimized as resistance, although there was never an actual threat.
The perpetrator-victim reversal often serves to justify hatred and hate speech and to ward off criticism. At the same time, this actually intimidates those affected. This can mean that those affected do not dare to file a complaint or ask for help.
 
We see a good example in the media right now:
The trial of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp - the public has already judged!
In the defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, many are certain: Heard is a perpetrator and Depp is her victim. Analysis of a misogynistic campaign.
During cross-examination of Johnny Depp in the Virginia courtroom, the attorney conducting the interrogation read out a text message the Oscar-nominated actor wrote about his ex-wife Amber Heard: ""Hopefully that cunt's body is decomposing in the frigging trunk of a Honda Civic.”
The Depp and Heard defamation trial can be seen livestreamed on YouTube and the comments below the clip laughed at the text message. ""LOL Honda Civic,"" said one. Most of these comments are pro-Johnny Depp and anti-Amber Heard. The trial is widely followed in the media and online, with a flood of pro-dork articles, comments and hashtags. They spread the narrative that Depp should finally get ""justice"": #JusticeforJohnny dominates the internet. And the facts that speak for Depp's guilt are hidden.
 
The two actors are currently on trial because Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard in response to a 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which Heard wrote about her experiences with domestic violence . While Heard didn't name Depp in her article, Depp's team claims that it was about him and that the article cost Depp his career.
Heard has since filed a counterclaim for $100 million in damages, which the jury will also consider. Both reject allegations of abuse.
It's not the first time Heard and Depp have found themselves in court. Depp and Heard's difficult marriage ended in 2016 and has been a hit with the tabloids for years.
Many viewers have already decided that Depp is the real victim. ""I want to hug him and tell him everything will be fine,"" it says on TikTok. Comments on the live stream of the trial refer to Heard as a ""monster"" and a ""liar."" Viewers accuse her of being ""manipulative, calculating and a con man"", of ""faking"" crying in the courtroom and of looking ""smug"". The comments can be found all over Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. ""He could have killed you, he had every right,"" says one viral TikToker. One user called Heard a ""crazy bitch"" and explained: ""Because she has a vagina and Depp has a cock, the woman must be right.""
The media coverage is also partly one-sided. US media, in particular, run articles and analyzes aimed at convicting Heard of lying. ""All of Amber Heard's allegations revealed to be false"" is just one of many headlines on various online portals. The media adapts to the social media narrative.
 
German media also fall into this trap. After a psychologist hired by Depp's lawyers testified that she saw clear indications of a borderline personality disorder in Heard, some German media ran the headline: ""Psychologist in Depp trial: Heard has personality disorders"". The fact that this was an expert paid by Depp was only mentioned late in the text, if at all.
Everyone wants to read what is fraudulent and wrong about Heard. And not what is really happening.
In late 2018, after Heard wrote about her experience of domestic violence in The Washington Post, Depp's then-attorney Adam Waldman - famous for his shady ties to Russian oligarchs and disinformation campaigns, including the 2016 US election - released a statement claiming , Johnny Depp is a victim of domestic violence. Depp would sue both Heard and The Sun for defamatory statements. The Sun had described Depp as a ""woman beater"".
 
In January 2020, Waldman strategically leaked an edited, out-of-context audio recording. In the recording, Heard allegedly mocks Depp for being a male abuse victim. In the full version of the audio recording, Heard is heard sobbing on the phone and telling Depp that she thought he was going to kill her. She only refutes his apology for his violence against her with her statement about Depp as a victim of abuse - which was that it was a ""fair fight"" so he was a victim too.
Depp vs. Heard: ""A situation that undermines how abuse really works""
Depp's fans, men's rights activists and misguided feminists went wild for this shot. Johnny Depp became the poster boy for male abuse victims and Amber Heard for female abusers. Heard was now a perpetrator and Depp her victim.
It's a situation that undermines how abuse really works! Additionally, this behavior aims to discourage victims and survivors of abuse and violence from speaking out, fearing backlash similar to what is happening to Heard right now.
Back in 2016, Entertainment Tonight ran an article with screenshots of text messages from Stephen Deuters, Depp's personal assistant, to Herad, who apologized for Depp's abuse. ""When I told him he kicked you, he cried. It was disgusting and he knows it.”
In the current Fairfax defamation trial, Depp was confronted with text messages in which he insulted numerous women, including his ex-partner Vanessa Paradis, with whom he has two children, as ""whores"", ""cum eaters"" and ""cunts"". In messages to actor Paul Bettany, he suggests burning Heard alive and raping her corpse. Depp was once again celebrated by the Internet for having commented on and destroyed this alleged evidence so skilfully. Expert Khan asks Vice: ""The fact that he felt comfortable saying that via text message - what do you think he was saying to her face?""
In a secretly recorded video, Depp can be seen yelling drunk, smashing glasses, smashing doors and slamming cupboards. It proves Depp's aggressive nature and also his alcohol abuse - he had claimed in court that he was sober. When asked about alcohol consumption, Depp replied: ""Isn't it always happy hour somewhere?"" Depp fans also interpret such answers as ""skillful destruction"" by Heard's lawyer.
A court in the UK ruled in the 2020 Sun defamation trial that Depp is likely guilty of domestic violence towards Herad. The court ruled on the evidence that the tabloids' allegations were ""essentially true"" - with 12 separate abuse allegations proven in them. Many of those interested in the trial were confused, as most of the reporting in this trial had also focused on Heard's alleged lies and social media was dominated by Depp supporters.
 
Although Heard is now a court-proven victim, she continues to be portrayed as a liar. The smear campaign intensified – Bot Sentinel found 6000 fake accounts tweeting pro-depp/anti-heard posts and liking such tweets. The petition to fire Heard from the Aquaman franchise now reportedly has three million signatures, although many of those signatures have long been revealed to be bot activity.
Depp has now dragged his ex-wife to Virginia for the defamation lawsuit against her, a state known for its litigation tourism due to its weaker free speech laws. Abusers have been known to use the Virginia courts to further re-traumatize and financially drain their victims. As mentioned above, Depp's argument has already suffered severe setbacks. Also, an important part of his evidence for him as a victim of domestic violence was the allegation that Heard had cut off his finger. This was exposed as a lie by his own texts to three different people. But if that's not enough for you: there is an audio in which he admits that he did it. But even that doesn't matter to many.
In my view, too often people demand that abuse survivors be the ""perfect victim,"" a mold that Heard doesn't fit. Every laugh, every facial expression that doesn't mourn enough, that doesn't say ""poor mouse"", is interpreted by Heard as evidence of her false statements.
We have this idea that the victims will never retaliate!
They will take the hits and never say anything back... They are silenced to take the hits and not fight back - but protect themselves enough to report it.
The ""ideal victim"" is usually a white, heterosexual submissive woman who has only dated her husband. Heard's bisexuality has also been repeatedly used against her. Her alleged promiscuity and alleged infidelity during her marriage to Depp are also interpreted negatively. None of this has anything to do with whether Heard is a victim of domestic or sexual violence.
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's trial is an opportunity because of Depp's overwhelming support for misogynism in society, in the face of the debates about violence against women and #MeToo, women on a grand scale. The time must end to brand women and girls as liars, as mad bitches, as witches. The time must come to brand the male culprits as the human monsters and evil criminals, they are.
 
It doesn't matter at all what else is brought forward in terms of evidence and testimonies in this process. The verdict of the public has been made, Amber Heard is at best as a questionable victim at best, at worst as a mendacious, calculating perpetrator. And in any case, victims of domestic and sexual violence lost. Because the Depp vs. Heard cause will be used as an argument for not believing women for a very long time.
The supposedly democratic America is extremely misogynist and I would not advise anyone to marry an American, we see what happens in the media and not only in the Depp case!
 
The sad facts are:
 
Some 47,000 women and girls worldwide were killed by their
intimate partners or other family members in 2020. This means
that, on average, a woman or girl is killed by someone in her own
family every 11 minutes. Where trends can be calculated, they
show that the magnitude of such gender-related killings remains
largely unchanged, however, with only marginal increases and
decreases over the past decade.
 
The killing of women and girls at the hands of intimate partners or other family members – people whom
they would normally be expected to trust – represents one of the most extreme manifestations of gender-
based violence. Such killings are often the culmination of prior experiences of gender-based violence, which
can include psychological, sexual and physical abuse.
 
Female homicide perpetrated by intimate partners or other family members is not the only form of gender-
related killing of women and girls. This type of homicide can also be perpetrated outside the private sphere,
for example, in the case of intentional homicides of female sex workers, killings of women related to various
forms of trafficking and organized crime, and killings of women accused of witchcraft. Several types of
female homicide are committed on the grounds of gender-related motivations2 but there is not yet a
standardized approach to define and count all forms of gender-related killings of women and girls. When
available, statistical data on this type of homicide are often based on national definitions, practices or
specific legislation that are not comparable at the global level. To address this issue, the United Nations
system has held a series of consultations aimed at developing a new statistical approach to improving data
on gender-related killings of women and girls!
Out of all intentional homicides of women and girls in 2020, 58 per cent were perpetrated by intimate
partners or other family members, which suggests that the most dangerous place for women is the home.
By contrast, the share of all male homicides that can be attributed to intimate partners or other family
members amounted to just 10 per cent in 2020, suggesting that men and boys are primarily at risk of being
intentionally killed outside the family sphere.
 
Femicide – the killing of women and girls – is the most extreme form of violence on a continuum of violence and discrimination against women and girls. Various typologies of femicide have been proposed by researchers in the past several decades with most distinguishing ‘intimate femicide’ from various other types of femicide (e.g. familial femicide and stranger femicide). These two broad categories of femicide are defined below.
 
Intimate femicide also referred to as intimate partner femicide, captures the killing of women by current or former partners. Globally, women are much more likely than men to be assaulted, raped or killed by a current or former partner and it most often occurs within relationships where there is a history of intimate partner violence.
Non-intimate femicide involves the killing of women by someone with whom they did not share an intimate partner relationship, encompassing a broad range of femicide subtypes such as familial femicide, ‘other known perpetrator’ femicide and stranger femicide.
 
Below, drawing from prior research, various subtypes of the above broad categories of femicide are described separately. These are not always discrete categories and may often overlap.
For example, the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada has received national and international attention in the past several years. Some of these women are killed by male partners; others by acquaintances and strangers. If accepting that Indigenous women and girls are killed, in part, because they are women, the term ‘femicide’ might be used; however, what type of femicide is most appropriate given the types currently available below remains unclear because it is important to capture the way in which the combined identity of 'Indigenous' and 'woman' leads to higher risk of femicide. This example underscores the importance of intersecting identities in identifying risk as well as the fact that gender may not always be the dominant identity that leads to a woman being killed.
In reviewing the terms below, it was determined that none of the current types of femicide were appropriate for capturing the situation of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Therefore, in the ongoing efforts of the CFOJA to move knowledge forward, one of the first issues to be addressed is to identify an appropriate term and corresponding definition that will capture femicide of Indigenous women and girls. As new forms of femicide are identified, the CFOJA will continue to update the types of femicide and the various contexts within which they occur.
 
Armed conflict femicide
Both state and non-state actors perpetrate physical, sexual and psychological violence against women and girls as a ‘weapon of war’. Such actions are typically intended to punish or dehumanize women and girls and to persecute the community to which they belong. They are also used as a method of instilling fear, domination and control. Targeted killings are usually premeditated with lethal force intentionally used against selected victims.
 
Associated/Connected Femicide
This refers to the killing of a woman who was not the intended victim, sometimes referred to as a ‘collateral’ victim, in an attempted or completed femicide of another woman. This might be a female family member, friend, or stranger who was attempting to stop the killing, someone who was in proximity of a woman at high risk of violence, or an individual who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
 
Culturally-framed femicide
This refers to the killing of women or girls that are framed within a particular cultural context such as ‘honour’-based femicide or dowry-related femicide (see below).
 
    Dowry-related femicide
    A dowry is a cultural tradition whereby the family of the bride provides money and/or property to the family of the groom. When a larger dowry is requested following the marriage of the bride and groom, or when the groom’s family is dissatisfied with the dowry given to them, the woman starts to be considered an ‘unsuitable wife’. Women are then killed or forced to commit suicide through torture and harassment by the groom’s family.
     
     ‘Honour’-based femicide
    There is debate about the use of this term to refer to the killing of women or girls because their behaviour was seen by the perpetrator to bring shame to the family. Arguments against its use include are that it categorizes the killings of women and girls by the perpetrator’s rationale; it does not acknowledge that these killings are simply another form of familial femicide and so does not require a unique term; and/or there is no ‘honour’ in killing women and girls. Often perceived as normal behaviours in westernized contexts, the behaviours in question may include the choice of a partner not seen as appropriate, pursuit of education and/or employment, inappropriate attire, or premarital sex or the belief that premarital sex had occurred. Those who frame these killings within a cultural context argue that honour, from the perspective of the perpetrator, is believed to be restored to the family when the woman or girl is killed. These killings are usually perpetrated by male family members, although female perpetrators may also be involved. In some countries, these killings frequently take place in public to influence other women in the community.
 
Female-perpetrated femicide
Femicide by female perpetrators has been classified into a three-category typology by Diana Russell. The first category is a female acting as an agent of patriarchy, which may include dowry-related killings, female infanticide, and genital mutilation-related deaths. The second category captures females who may be acting as agents of male perpetrators such as accessories in gang-related femicide and what are referred to as ‘honour’ or dowry-related femicide. The final category captures females acting on their own behalf such as those who were driven by jealousy, or motivated by financial, crime-related or ideological activities.
 
Femicide in the context of human trafficking
This refers to the killing of a woman in the process of recruitment, transportation, and receipt of humans through use of threat, force and other coercive tactics as well as abduction, deceit, and/or abuse of power with the goal of exploitation. Individuals, particularly women and children, are often trafficked into prostitution or the sex trade industry, forced labour, slavery/practices, and other criminal activities.
Femicide in the context of what is referred to as sex work or prostitution
The killing of a woman who is involved in what is referred to as sex work or prostitution. Patriarchy, racism, colonization and stigmatization by society are some key aspects that can be used to understand women’s vulnerability to femicide in this context.
 
Genital mutilation-related femicide
This type of femicide involves the killing of a girl or woman as the result of the practice of genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation involves the partial or full removal and/or injury of female genitalia for non-medical purposes. It is typically performed on girls between infancy and 15 years of age. Infections which arise as the result of unhygienic operations frequently result in loss of life.
 
Lesbophobic femicide
This type of femicide involves the killing of a woman by a perpetrator or group of perpetrators motivated by hate or rejection of the woman’s sexual orientation. Sexual violence may also be evident in these femicides because the perpetrator(s) believe the victim violated traditional sexual or gender norms.
 
Organized crime-related femicide
Beyond femicide perpetrated in the context of human trafficking, other forms of organized crime-related femicide involves the killing of women who are associated with gangs, drugs, smuggling, and/or gun markets. This type of killing can involve abduction, torture and sexual assault, murder and mutilation, decapitation, public displays and/or dumping of naked bodies and/or body parts. These femicides are often meant to serve as a threat to individuals or other organized crime groups.
 
Racist femicide
This refers to killings that occur because of hate or rejection of a woman’s ethnic or racial origins, real or perceived, or her genetic features.
 
Transphobic femicide
This refers the killing of transgender victims by a perpetrator or group of perpetrators who are motivated by hate or rejection of the transgender identity. Sexual violence may also be evident in these femicides because the perpetrator(s) believe the victim violated traditional sexual or gender norms.
 
Sexual femicide
This term refers to sexual violations and sexual violence that result in the death of a woman or girl. Sexual femicides may be intentional including, for example, sexual violence perpetrated during armed conflicts or against particular women, but they may also be unintentional such as sexual violence perpetrated against women by male partners that results in the woman’s death. The sexual violence involved in sexual femicide may range from leaving the victim unclothed, often displayed publicly, to rape and mutilation.

<p>There are many people that are just like Amber that think they can chip away at the creditability and reputation of those who are successful in an act of revenge and spite for fame, notoriety, and financial gain by simply creating false claims and accusing innocent people of horrible acts. Amber Heard has a track record of domestic abuse. Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard. She told Johnny Depp ""Tell the world, Johnny Depp, tell them, I, Johnny Depp, a man, I am a victim too of domestic violence, and see how many people believe or side with you.""
