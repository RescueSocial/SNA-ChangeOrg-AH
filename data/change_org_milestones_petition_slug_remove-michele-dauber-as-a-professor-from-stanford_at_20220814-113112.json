Hopefully getting us more supporters who will sign and share themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I started this petition only 2 days ago after reading Ms. Dauber's horrible and unprofessional tweets. Although I have no ties to Stanford University, Johnny Depp, Camille Vasquez, or any of the organizations they are tied to, I was infuriated that Michele Dauber was not only allowed to continue her name calling and degrading remarks about Ms. Vasquez, Johnny Depp, and their supporters on Twitter, but that Stanford is evidently turning a blind eye to her public display of sexist remarks, defamation, and name calling.\u00a0 As I stated in the petition description,\u00a0 if this was a man making these remarks on social media, he would have been blasted by the public and Stanford University would not have tolerated his behavior. They would have suspended him or fired him immediately.\u00a0 Why is it okay for a woman to do what a man is not? THIS DOUBLE SIDED STANDARDS AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE HAS TO STOP! MALE OR FEMALE, BOTH NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!</p>\n<p>PLEASE continue to share the petition link so we can get this petition more visibility and signatures.\u00a0</p>\n<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SIGNING, SHARING AND SUPPORTING THIS!!</p>", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "30651049", "createdAt": "2022-06-12T07:32:35.000Z", "signatureCount": 100}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "30650695", "createdAt": "2022-06-12T03:04:16.000Z", "signatureCount": 50}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "30650560", "createdAt": "2022-06-12T01:43:30.000Z", "signatureCount": 25}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "30650249", "createdAt": "2022-06-11T22:30:42.000Z", "signatureCount": 10}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "30649557", "createdAt": "2022-06-11T16:49:31.000Z", "signatureCount": 5}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjEx", "hasNextPage": false}}}}}], "count": 1, "cursors": [""]}
