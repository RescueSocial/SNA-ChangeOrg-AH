We have a long way to go to get the attention it needs. Please share this with anyone you know that would be interested in this. We have to get the word out that printing these stories without proof  is damaging and has consequences. The court has cleared Johnny Depp and People magazine needs to print an apology and retraction for their part in spreading this heinous information. </p>","{'id': '226705510', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/tb/kc/BAtbKCgdVxdNUES-800x450-noPad.jpg?1655910636', 'processing': False}}",,
