A survivor struggle is nothing you should PRETEND to understand or be if you haven't really survived that horror. I knew she was lying by they way she was talking, My abuse happened over 20 years ago and I still struggle to talk about and I'm just now realizing I need to go see someone,  I totally kept it in. It takes a really sick individual to make light of things like abuse for their own selfish reasons. I really hope she pay for this and truly gets the help she needs. She have no sympathy for me or any survivor, the only way I will see she is truly remorseful is if she take the steps on her own to get help and own up to what she did. She set D.A and S.A victims back with her lying. She truly, truly, truly upset me and will never ever be a  good woman to me. All I can say is wow, WOW AMBER!!

Mainstream media wants to paint us as misogynistic or just super Depp fans and that's just false! The Mainstream media doesn't speak for us and as long as they're defending Amber they're complicit in HARMING victims/survivors further! 
The Mainstream media afforded my now ex husband the same type of support when he murdered & raped a girl & killed her family! THE MEDIA decided to blame it on the Iraq war being just hard and stressful. They decided to try to get me to talk, even offering a couple hundred thousand dollars to get an interview where I'd day the war stressed him out and he had no leadership instead of me saying he is and has been an abusive monster and the army failed me and the family he hurt. And the courts failed us as well, and the army failed by still sending him while knowing what he was capable of! Mainstream didn't want me to say all that. They wanted lies. They protect abusers and always have. They spin narratives and always have. 
Amber is being protected. She and her attorney are liars. Amber does NOT represent me and the only abuse survivors she does represent are the ones being manipulated & gaslit by her. 

We are abuse survivors. We are strong. We are women. And we are not represented by amber heard .  We are not misogynistic. We are not all far right wing extremists. We are from all different backgrounds. All religions. All have different political views. And Our support for Johnny Depp, the ACTUAL survivor of domestic abuse, has actually let us all come together and agree on this issue- Amber heard lied, still lies, as does her attorney, and we all support the truth. We don't want or need Amber heard to say anything on our behalf. Ever! 
We stand together against abusers and together as survivors and with victims! We speak for us! We realize men, too, can be and are abused by women! 
I did not almost die at the hands of my ex husband so that Amber freaking Heard could prance around and act like she's telling our story. Her story is one of abuse, except she is the perpetrator of such abuse! Not the victim or survivor! 
She does not speak for me .",0,0,Event,33546413,1,comment,2022-06-03T22:07:02Z,,928817882,928817882,Jamie,Winters,Jamie,Jamie Winters,Madera,CA,US,,en-US,,226666136.0,photos/2/zv/pl/HnZVplkeTidlJEd-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/2/zv/pl/HnZVplkeTidlJEd-48x48-noPad.jpg?1654292992,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/2/zv/pl/HnZVplkeTidlJEd-128x128-noPad.jpg?1654292993,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/2/zv/pl/HnZVplkeTidlJEd-400x400-noPad.jpg?1654292994,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/2/zv/pl/HnZVplkeTidlJEd-800x800-noPad.jpg?1654292996,False,800.0,800.0,[],33546413,33546413,Amber Heard does not represent me as a woman.,2022-06-03T19:31:41Z,,2022-06-03T19:31:41Z,2022-06-04T02:41:48Z,en-US,['en'],"Amber Heard, you do not represent me as a woman.","<p><strong>Amber Heard does not represent me as a woman.</strong></p>
