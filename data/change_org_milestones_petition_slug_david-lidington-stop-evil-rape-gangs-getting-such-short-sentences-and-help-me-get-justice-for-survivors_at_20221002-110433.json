Could you please read and help me support Swinton Lock Activity Centre; a small charity in Rotherham that has played a significant part in my journey to justice and recovery. This little charity has also offered support to both my parents who to this day say they couldn\u2019t have made it through the last 3 years without them.  As a safe space we have been given the opportunity to speak about our past, share concerns about our present and build our plans for the future.  I now feel as a young woman that I have the confidence and self-esteem to use this to raise awareness to protect the children of tomorrow and to help professionals learn from the failures of my past. I am asking if you could make a donation of whatever you can afford to help this charity to continue its excellent work within excess of 200 vulnerable people including adults and children, all requiring intense support. If you follow the link to the their website which I am currently volunteering to run and plan to add lots of information and updates shortly can you please  follow the link below and click on the donate button at the top of the page, I would be really grateful.\nThank you and Merry Christmas\n\nElizabeth xx\nwww.swintonlock.org", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": {"providerName": "Charitycheckout", "photoUrl": "https://fundraise.charitycheckout.co.uk/images/default/8628cfb3e0d143a299295e8444afbadc.jpg", "description": "Swinton Lock Activity Centre is a community based Arts, Education and Activity Centre.
