StarterPetitionUpdate,27578369,2020-08-23T14:39:04.000Z,,Join us TOMORROW for ANC 6A Community Outreach Committee Meeting,"<p>Dear Amazing Supporters, </p>
<p>TOMORROW August 24 at 7pm the ANC 6A Community Outreach Committee is hosting a meeting. The letter the original signatories sent to 6A is on the agenda (this is the same language in the petition). However, this is NOT a typical ANC meeting -- it is not run by Commissioners and not all Commissioners are obligated to attend. <strong>This meeting does not meet our demands, and we will express this tomorrow evening. Will you join us?</strong></p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tomorrow, Monday, August 24, 2020 at 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>How to Log-in:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The meeting takes place via WebEx: <a href=""https://dcnet.webex.com/dcnet/onstage/g.php?MTID=e8ef982b15b462a158b33a10fa34a8a34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dcnet.webex.com/dcnet/onstage/g.php?MTID=e8ef982b15b462a158b33a10fa34a8a34</a>.

Each speaker will have 3 minutes for comments.</li>
<li>Spend the first 2.5 minutes talking from the heart on why this issue is important to you. At the end please reiterate residents’ demands. You can say something like, 
<ul>
<li>“Due to the lack of input at the June 14th meeting, I demand that ANC 6A reserve significant time during the full ANC meeting in September for community input, especially from our Black and Brown neighbors, on the impact of the police on 6A residents. I also demand that ANC 6A retract its original letter and set the record straight with 6A residents and with the D.C. Council.”</li>

<p><strong>Recap of Our Demands &amp; What Went Down</strong></p>
<p>Our Demands</p>
<p>We are angry and disappointed that our ANC has chosen to ignore the effects that the MPD has on the lives of DC residents -- particularly Black residents. We demand the following steps to begin rebuilding trust with the community.</p>
<ol>
<li>We demand that the Commission reserve significant time on next month’s meeting agenda to address these issues, and that such meeting include substantial time for community input. Alternatively, we demand a separate town hall, properly noticed and allowing for significant community input, for the ANC 6A on these issues. <strong>Neither of these demands have been met.</strong>
</li>
<li>We demand that ANC 6A correct the record by writing another letter to Chairman Mendelson and the D.C. Council, and to Mayor Bowser. This second letter should clearly acknowledge the devastating impact the MPD has on many DC residents, including ANC 6A residents, and state that the Commission’s initial letter was sent without the Commission soliciting input from its constituents, per DC statute. <strong>This demand has also not been met.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What Happened?</p>
<ul>
<li>On June 11, 2020, ANC 6A voted to approve a letter in support of MPD and in opposition to widespread calls to defund MPD, without proper notice in the <a href=""https://anc6a.org/wp-content/uploads/ANCA0620.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">ANC 6A agenda</a>. </li>
<li>On June 14, 2020, ANC 6A sent this letter to the D.C. Council without a comment period, ensuring there would be no constituent input on the subject. </li>
<li>On July 9, 2020, ANC 6A actively silenced residents in the monthly ANC 6A meeting by <a href=""https://dcnet.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/dcnet/recording/play/43d32dc7c1954e96b320c7b4ab888519"" rel=""nofollow"">not allowing for public comment</a>, a clear abdication of section 1-309.11(b)(3) of the <a href=""https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/1-309.11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">DC Official Code</a>.</li>
<li>On July 29, 2020, ANC 6A residents who opposed the Commission’s egregious actions sent a letter to the Commissioners with their demands.</li>
<li>A Community Outreach Committee meeting was scheduled by ANC 6A for August 24th. This session is <strong>not</strong> a separate town wall, as listed in our demands.</li>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27454103,2020-08-05T05:48:05.000Z,,Media Coverage in Hill Rag + How to Get More Involved!,"<p>Dear Supporters,</p>
<p>Great news! Our local community newspaper <em>Hill Rag </em>has covered the issues that this petition critically raises--ANC 6A Commissioners' racist and inaccurate letter in support of MPD funding, and their silencing of residents they claim to represent. Have a read and please share widely: <a href=""https://www.hillrag.com/2020/08/04/residents-call-for-anc-to-retract-inaccurate-and-racist-letter/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hillrag.com/2020/08/04/residents-call-for-anc-to-retract-inaccurate-and-racist-letter/</a></p>
<p>ALSO, if you are an ANC 6A resident, we would be so grateful if you could go back and add a comment on the petition with your Single Member District (SMD) (you can look this up <a href=""https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InformationLookup/index.html?appid=8b54d6b6dc1041f3a4c5de125d7c9580"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). <strong>FINALLY, if you would like to get more involved with your ANC 6A neighbors on these issues, please email kristin.g.sekerci@gmail.com!</strong></p>
<p>In solidarity.</p>",,,
