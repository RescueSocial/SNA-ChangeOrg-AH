Yes, this petition is still active and I'm still promoting it where I can. I hope everyone is doing well and safe in these troubling times. I have a couple of updates. Metallica did recently play Fixxxer for the first time ever on the 40th anniversary. I am happy for that. But they still left anything from St Anger in the dark. They still play St anger itself and Frantic every now and then, but nothing else. We haven't seen the situation change in some years now. At the time we hit a couple hundred signatures, I did email Metallica where I could that we had some momentum going around. At the time of this update, I see we reached over 700, which is great! But sadly I guess for someone as big as Metallica, it needs to be a lot more for them to even bat an eye. I have faith in you all to share the petition around as much as you can. Not really donate money, but share the link around. I'd prefer that. Whatever you can do. This album needs the appreciation it deserves. I feel as Metallica lets us down with caving to popular demand still playing the overplayed songs. From the 80s and early 90s. Nothing much from Load/Reload and St. Anger. Our focus is St. Anger, but Load/Reload still do deserve some recognition as well.

Let me update you on one thing that happened in that time gap: I attended the AWMH food bank volunteering thing back in May. I'm very late to mention this, but I went with a St. Anger shirt knowing they will take a picture and send it to Metallica. I can post the picture in another update, but for now just know I did my best there to show to Metallica there IS love for the album. They probably didn't even see it though, there were so many places and volunteers. I made sure my shirt was visible though. It was very fun to attend it, I'd do it again.</p>\n<p>Now as for our mission here, we still have it. Recently Metallica has launched their tour of Symphony and Metallica 2 (S&amp;M 2) and they seem to be a bit busy with it at the moment, but that doesn't invalidate our mission. They are still going to tour in South America, we still have our chance. The reason we still have our mission, is because Metallica does not move from St. Anger (the song), Frantic, and the acoustic All Within My Hands. They still play those 3 songs on and off, nothing else from the album. Now, yes this is better than not having any songs from St Anger be played live, but I believe Metallica still does not understand we have a large hunger for the rest of the album. It still needs more love. They are missing on potentially amazing live plays to hype up the crowd. Come on, how many times have they played Enter Sandman, Battery, etc? People already know those songs. Time for a new mixup! Sweet Amber, Some Kind of Monster, Invisible Kid, Purify, the actual metal All Within My Hands, Dirty Window, The Unnamed Feeling, My World, and Shoot Me Again!!! Where are they, Metallica?? Again, it's up to us fans to let them hear our voice. We have to do the work, we have to make sure they will hear us. And never give up. Post on Instagram your shirt of St Anger, or just an image of St Anger from google or something to show it's St Anger, and tag Metallica on it with the link to this petition. We can do this guys!

A couple of things I want to mention. Metallica played All Within My Hands but in an acoustic version in November last year, just like they did in 2007. Although I was happy they played a St. Anger song again, it was of course, not the metal original version. I personally appreciate that though that it was played at all.</p>\n<p>Now that we're there, James Hetfield has started to grow out his St. Anger days look. Longer hair and that biker mustache. Rocking it like before! :D And the rest of the band with longer hair too, quite like how they started touring after getting Robert Trujillo. Here's hoping they at least play one song as it was in the album. Ergo, metal. It really is shocking me that they haven't played a St Anger song at this point. It makes this petition more valid but it really is shocking. What's going on that they don't play the songs anymore? I mean I know I stated the possible reasons in the petition, but they had to have at least played one once in this tour. They still haven't yet. But again, here's hoping they do, if not, we at least should hope this petition is noticed by Metallica somehow.</p>\n<p>That is all for now, thank you for taking your time to read this if you did, and rock on!
