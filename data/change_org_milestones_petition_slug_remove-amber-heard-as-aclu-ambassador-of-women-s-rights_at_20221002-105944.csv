StarterPetitionUpdate,30554650,2022-05-15T20:21:41.000Z,,Let’s keep it going!!,"<p>The trial is set to start up again tomorrow and Amber will again be telling her lies on the stand in her highly exaggerated and theatrical manner. It is the same woman who colluded with the ACLU and the Washington Post to create the fabricated story that ruined Johnny Depp’s reputation and career. Though being charged with domestic violence in a previous relationship, which was a woman, Amber was extended the role of Ambassador for Women’s Rights. This purpose of this petition is to communicate to the ACLU that Amber Heard should not be an ambassador of women’s rights specific to domestic violence, when she herself was previously charged with such against another woman. Additionally, the trial has brought to light even more abuses against her former husband and people who worked for her. Please share this along with me. </p>",,,
