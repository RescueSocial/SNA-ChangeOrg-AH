The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

832685394,"“It doesn’t matter how rich or poor a person is, what gender or social class, or how much fame or education she possesses. Verbal, mental, and physical abuse can happen to anyone. It doesn’t matter what a woman’s ethnicity is because the only distinguishing color of abuse is black-and-blue.” ― La Toya Jackson

Abusers – they’ll manipulate and they’ll lie to you. And when you no longer give them that power, they’ll try to manipulate your family or the people close to you instead. Abusers want everyone to hate you just as much as they do. It’s sick. Their lack of morals and integrity is sick. The amount of hate they harbor in their hearts is sick, as are their psychopathic or sociopathic traits.”― LaTasha “Tacha B.” Braxton


Victim blaming is common in power based cultures. Because in such a culture, ""might makes right,"" when the primary aggressor is more powerful, the victims are held to be at fault for their own mistreatment. This attitude helps onlookers stay complacent and feel reassured that not much in the world needs to change really.

There is usually some rationalization for blaming the victim, most commonly, that the victim could have escaped the situation or avoided it in the first place. This is a grave confusion between moral obligation and practical opportunity. Everyone has a right to pursue his or own desires and self-interest without abuse from others. It is true that sometimes a person may choose to avoid a situation where danger is above average, but a life composed entirely of this approach is so limiting, it is dehumanizing.

In the arena of domestic violence, victim blaming is applied with a vengeance against survivors who stay with a primary aggressor beyond the first obviously violent or controlling episode. This disregards the right of anyone to be in a relationship of his or her choosing without abuse. Staying where there has been abuse does not constitute consent or permission for the abuse. Victims may or may not be benefited by concrete assistance, but validation of their experiences are essential for sanity and growth. The tendency to blame survivors has some additional elements:

    Failure to recognize the simple fact that attempting to leave a relationship is blocked or punished by the primary aggressor most of the time. Someone who has not experienced this may have trouble imagining this.
    Confusion with the ""duty to mitigate damages"" from contract law. Abuse is not just a breach of contract, and human relationships are not subject to contract law!
    Confusion of submission with consent. This is discussed elsewhere on this site.
    Confusion of tolerance with consent. Most people endure some meanness from their partners because they consider it an aberration that won't be repeated. The systematic nature of domestic violence only becomes clear over time.
    Survivors blame themselves for the abuse (this is victim self-blaming). They of course are aided in this by the primary aggressor who is constantly blaming them. Therefore, they for a long time stay in the relationship and try to change their own behavior to end the abuse. When and if they retroactively reframe the experience as abusive, they deserve validation, even if they stayed ""when something was wrong.""
    Final clarity by a survivor that the relationship is abusive and unworkable can not be retro-actively applied to earlier in the relationship when the survivor was bewildered about what was happening.
    Even where the survivor recognizes the abuse and its inevitability, she may stay in a relationship because it appears to be (and may in fact be) her best option in life considering the difficulties and lack of support she faces alone. Where all options are bad, a choice does not constitute consent to the the downsides of any option chosen, rather just acquiescence. If later, better options arise, validation is warranted about abuse when options were all poor.
    The effects of abuse (confusion, low self-esteem, bitterness, lessened sensitivity to danger, etc..(many more)) are erroneously attributed to the survivor as personal characteristics that lead her to ""choose"" the abusive situation.

Why We Blame Victims for Domestic Violence!
How many times have you read a news story about a woman accusing someone of abuse only to scroll down to read the comments? Most likely, nestled among a few well-meaning comments of support, you found a bevy of judgment and shaming directed at the survivor. And, they're coming from both men and women.
If it was so bad, why didn’t she leave? I would walk out the door the second a man hit me.”

“She didn’t even report it to the police. She’s probably just making this up.”

“She only wants money.”

Why do some people jump to blame the victim? At its core, says Elise Lopez, a researcher in sexual and domestic violence prevention and response at the University of Arizona, victim-blaming is about self-preservation.
	Compare these reactions to how some people respond to seeing a photo of an overweight person, says Lopez. “People think, ‘If I were overweight, I’d go to the gym everyday and I would lose that weight.’ They don’t think about how hard that would be,” she says.

The same mindset often comes into play when people read about domestic violence. “A lot of people have a gut reaction to violence. It’s emotionally charged. They think if somebody is being abused, they probably did something to incite it.” In essence, if people can find a reason why abuse is the victim’s fault, then abuse is something that can not only be controlled but prevented. And, in turn, it won’t happen to them.

	Victim-Blaming Makes Survivors Afraid

It took Donna Kaz 12 years after leaving her abuser to identify as a survivor. It took her 35 years to come out publically about it. Her memoir, UN/MASKED, Memoirs of a Guerrilla Girl On Tour, was published in 2016.

Disclosure is a process, she says, and one that took her a long time because of fear.

“I was afraid of being shamed and judged,” she says. “There’s still this stigma … a reluctance to believe women’s stories. And I think that hasn’t changed. We need to believe women when they tell their story.”

Kaz’s abuser was the actor William Hurt. Their relationship occurred in the ‘70s, back before domestic violence was really on the radar as a widespread epidemic. Kaz never told anyone she was being abused and she never called the police. She blamed herself.

“You do a sort of self-blaming because there’s so much guilt involved when you’re with an abuser. You blame yourself for staying, you’re embarrassed and it’s shameful. Therefore you don’t talk about it. I think that’s why a lot of women don’t express themselves. They’re sort of trying to figure it out themselves.”

Kaz says that when she did decide to make her story public, she hoped it might help change things.

“You’re led to believe every single person who has come out as being abused by someone, famous or not, is lying,” says Kaz. “I noticed in some interviews [for her book] people don’t even want to talk about the abuse. I hope by telling my story it changes this.”

What Victim-Blaming Looks Like

Following are a selection of real comments underneath several news stories concerning accusations of abuse.

The Washington Post reported that a photo of Aroldis Chapman of the NY Yankees was featured in the team’s 2017 calendar as October’s player, which also happens to be Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Chapman was suspended for 30 days from the MLB in 2016 after he was accused of strangling his girlfriend. Commenters quickly dismissed the story.

“Wife beating? Meh. As long as he beats Boston, too, it's just collateral damage.”

“…all this stuff about Chapman has been way overblown. Media just love having an easy villain to stomp on, even if his case doesn't in fact fit their narrative.”

“He just signed a contract upwards of $100 million and he abused a woman. I really wish people would stop making such a big deal about it.”

When USA Today reported that former Spice Girl Mel B had accused her estranged husband of years of domestic abuse, one woman commented, “Why is it that everyone saw this coming but her? Then she pops out two kids for him? Let's see what idiot she hooks up with next.”
	In a Huffington Post article on the same story, another woman commented, “Not to disclaim her accusations, but where is the paper trail to back up these allegations? There wasn't any mention of police reports being filed.”

Responses You Can Use When Victim-Blaming Occurs

Whether the words come from a friend or family member you trust, or a complete stranger who feels the need to share his or her opinion on your situation, experiencing victim-blaming as a victim can be shocking and demoralizing.

Kaz says she had nightmares about telling her story of abuse.
	“I had to go through a lot of legal counsel and present my story as truthful as I could from my point of view.” In the end, Hurt never responded to her book and overall, Kaz says she feels empowered by coming out, making her who she is today, which she says is a feminist activist.

But other victims are still hiding, afraid of the consequences if they speak up. In turn, Lopez says society has “an ethical and moral responsibility to correct myths about violence.” 

Below are some suggested responses for three common victim-blaming statements:

1. Why didn’t she just leave if she was really being abused?
“Well, it’s actually kind of hard for victims to leave,” Lopez says. “It can be hard for a victim to leave if they do not have financial resources, if the abuser is the primary breadwinner. Many abusers will also threaten to harm children or pets if the victim leaves. Victims often need time and support from family and friends to develop a safety plan for leaving.”

She suggests adding in a personal anecdote to demonstrate this. For example, you could say something like, “I had a friend who was being abused, but her abuser was leaving their children alone. Yet, her partner said he would hurt her children if she tried to leave. Just the thought of putting them in harm’s way paralyzed her from trying to escape.”

Says Lopez, “I think using a scenario like that can be a way to enlighten someone without causing the situation to escalate. It’s likely that they haven’t thought it through.” Adding to that, instead of telling a victim to “just leave,” a more helpful response would be to figure out what resources need to be in place for her to do so safely.

2. Why didn’t she report it to the police?
Many survivors don’t report abuse to the police because they’re afraid of retributions from the abuser. They may also be ashamed, embarrassed or reluctant to let others know what’s going on. Also, many times, abuse is not physical—it’s psychological, emotional, verbal or financial, and these types of abuses are not often seen in the eyes of the law as “illegal.” Survivors may also blame themselves for the abuse—if she fought back, she may fear she is partially to blame (she isn’t, agree experts), or that she could be charged as well.

Finally, if the survivor is dependent on the abuser financially, she may be afraid that by calling the police, he could be sent to jail or lose his job, an especially fearful situation if there is no second income.

3. She’s obviously looking for attention/fame/money/retribution.
Survivors and advocates alike whole-heartedly agree that it is not easy coming forward to report abuse or assault and few women would want to bring that type of attention on herself without a good reason. As demonstrated by the above examples of victim-blaming, survivors often fear no one will believe them when or if they report abuse. Furthermore, studies show that false allegations of spouse abuse are far less prevalent than the problem of survivors who don’t report the abuse at all.

Additionally, abusers often craft a situation ahead of time to paint the survivor as troubled and the abuser as the competent hero trying to help her, according to domestic violence expert Stephanie Angelo. It’s all part of the power and control that abusers try to exert over victims, even after she reports abuse. 

How Social Stigma Silences Domestic Violence Victims!
Why many domestic violence victims are reluctant to report!
Many domestic violence victims suffer in silence. Enduring a steady pattern of abuse and humiliation at home, they bravely attempt to present a solid exterior in public. Sometimes they pull it off; usually, they do not. We notice the signs. Whether physical or emotional, red flags are flying.  

In such cases, some people wonder why victims continue to deny the abuse, which is often visibly manifest to those around them. The answer has to do with the way domestic violence victims fear they will be treated.
Reluctant to Report: Silenced by Stigma

Many victims of domestic abuse remain under the radar because they are ashamed that they have chosen to remain in a relationship with an abusive partner. Both culturally and socially, victims are sensitive to the judgment they fear from others, whether they are suffering physical abuse, emotional abuse or both. Reporting the perpetrator´s behavior would involve revealing embarrassing and humiliating details they would rather never discuss—especially if they have been enduring this treatment for years.
Victims with children fear being labeled a “bad parent” for staying with a violent partner. It is easier for some victims in this situation to rationalize they are living with a bad spouse, but a good parent. This argument breaks down if abuse is occurring in front of the children, which could create a child endangerment scenario—a separate crime.

Logically, we acknowledge that we cannot subjectively understand the reasons a victim stays with an abusive partner from our perspective on the outside looking in. Yet when it comes to assessing perceptions of domestic abuse, research indicates observers might nonetheless be ready to assign levels of blame depending not only on the actions of the abuser but also of the victim.  
Unfairly Judging Victims of Domestic Abuse

Yamawaki et al. (2012) conducted a study titled “Perceptions of Domestic Violence,” to examine attitudes toward domestic violence victims and perpetrators. They found that study participants attributed more blame to a victim who returned to the abuser, as compared with a victim about whom they had no such information.  

They also found that participants who held domestic violence myths attributed more blame to the victim and that men blamed the victim and minimized the incident more than women did.

The study also addressed some of the reasons victims remain in relationships with abusive partners. Regarding the reasons women do not leave, Yamawaki et al. cite prior research indicating a variety of reasons, including a cost-benefit analysis weighing relational benefits against the costs of separation. We could argue that male victims no doubt engage in the same type of relational balancing test.

Victims also stay in relationships with abusive partners for fear of how they will be treated by others who learn about the abuse. This fear stems from the way victims are often treated differently, both personally and professionally, after details of their victimization come to light.  

Light Duty for Victims: Protective Bias  

Some victims of domestic violence finally muster the courage to break the silence and report the abuse, only to find themselves treated differently as a result of their disclosure. Of course, family, friends, neighbors and colleagues are all relieved the victim finally came forward. Even the most well-meaning supporters, however, are prone to viewing and treating the victim differently.  

Treating the victim differently, in a misguided attempt to be helpful, can have a particularly negative impact in the workplace. After reporting the abuse, a victim may have to take time off of work for doctor´s visits, meetings with law enforcement and prosecutors, and testimony in court. Employers routinely profess support and understanding of the need to miss work under such circumstances.  In some cases, however, this support can translate into disparate treatment.

Some victims of domestic violence return to their job only to find their workload reduced, assignments altered to “light duty,” or face other job modifications as a result of reporting their victimization. Some employers honestly think they are helping victims by reducing their workload or changing their job assignments to give them time “to recover.”  

Good intentions aside, for many victims, returning to a job that has been compromised as a result of finding the courage to report the abuse is a form of re-victimization. Consequently, for some victims, even the potential of facing adverse job consequences is a reason not to come forward. This reluctance facilitates the continuing pattern of abuse. 

Encouragement and Empowerment 
Continuing education and community awareness of the dynamics of domestic abuse can reduce the perceptions of the stigma that cause many victims to suffer in silence. Encouraging reporting through support and empowerment, coupled with assurances of job stability, will help victims break the cycle of abuse and embark on the road to recovery. 

Celebrity domestic violence occurs even in the most seemingly-stable relationships.

Hollywood violence knows no gender, age, or reason, and some of these allegations are gonna curl your toes.

Who dragged his partner with a car? Who beat someone's face in so badly she needed to be hospitalized? Whose own mother and sister accused this superstar, award-winning actor of physical abuse?

Things are about to get real deep and dark in here, so we hope you have a flashlight, a blanket, and a box of tissues, because ugh.

Also, hey, can someone remind these asshats that violence is never the answer?

That could be pretty helpful, all things considered.

Bad examples of narcisstic, psychopathic, violent and dangerous famous men:

Johnny Depp

Court to Johnny Depp: You’re a Wife Beater and That’s Final!
The actor lost his request to appeal a court decision that sided with The Sun newspaper for calling him a wife beater. 
Johnny Depp has lost his request to appeal a British court libel decision that sided with the Sun newspaper, which called him “wife beater.” In a Thursday decision, the Royal Court of Appeal in London ruled against Depp—essentially agreeing that there was enough evidence that the Pirates of the Caribbean actor had indeed beaten his former wife Amber Heard, as she claimed.

The 57-year-old actor argued that he had not received a fair trial in his original unsuccessful civil case against the newspaper and that he had new evidence, including claims that Heard lied about donating her $7 million divorce settlement to charity.

The original court ruling said that the Sun article that labeled the actor as an abusive husband was “substantially true,” and that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had frequently attacked his 34-year old wife.

Heard and Depp settled their divorce out of court and Depp was never criminally charged despite Heard detailing how she feared for her life and how Depp had even once severed a section of his finger and written in blood on the wall during a fight. Depp says it was Heard who was abusive and that his finger was severed when she hurled a whiskey bottle at him during an angry confrontation.

The gory details of Depp and Head’s clearly tumultuous relationship had become tabloid fodder since they split up in 2016 amid allegations of Depp’s drug and alcohol-fueled attacks that included frequent beatings and even a hostage situation in Australia when she claimed Depp kept her holed up for three days. Depp in his defense has always claimed Heard was the attacker, and that he frequently hid from her or told her what she wanted to hear to placate her in order to avoid her angry rampages.

The British court sided with Heard’s account of events and ruled that it was accurate for the British newspaper to label the actor as a wife beater. “We refuse Mr Depp’s application to admit further evidence in support of his proposed appeal and we conclude that the appeal has no real prospect of success and that there is no other compelling reason for it to be heard,” the court ruled Thursday. “We accordingly refuse permission to appeal.”

The judges also wrote in their ruling that they did not “believe that the judge would have reached a different conclusion if it had been established before him that Ms. Heard had given a misleading impression about how much of the $7m which she said that she had donated to charity had in fact been paid.”

Heard’s spokesperson told the Guardian that they were pleased “but by no means surprised” by the court ruling. “The evidence presented in the U.K. case was overwhelming and undeniable,” the spokesperson said. “To reiterate, the original verdict was that Mr. Depp committed domestic violence against Amber on no fewer than 12 occasions and she was left in fear of her life.”

Depp’s lawyer Joelle Rich told The Daily Beast in a statement that the ruling “further demonstrates that there are clear and objective reasons to seriously question the decision reached in the UK court.” They went on to say that Depp looks forward to presenting the “complete, irrefutable evidence of the truth” in the American libel case against Heard “where she will have to provide full disclosure.”

The Sun newspaper, which had the most to lose in the request for appeal, also expressed delight at the ruling against Depp. “The Sun had every confidence that this leave to appeal application would not be granted and are pleased with today’s decision,” the Sun said in a statement. “The case had a full, fair and proper hearing, and today’s decision vindicates the courageous evidence that Amber Heard gave to the court about domestic abuse, despite repeated attempts to undermine and silence her by the perpetrator. The Sun will continue to stand up and campaign for victims of domestic abuse.”

Now there is a defamation trial in America against Amber Heard in these Days:
Amber Heard Believed Johnny Depp Was “Going To Kill Me,” She Tells Jury Of Alleged 2015 Attack, More Sexual Assaults; $50M Defamation Trial Goes Dark For Next Week!
“He’s going to kill me now,” Amber Heard told a Virginia jury today she thought to herself of an alleged late 2015 beating by Johnny Depp. “He’s going to kill me and he’s won’t’ even realize it.”

Along with those searing words and another story of an alleged sexual assault, Heard ended her second day of testimony in the $50 million defamation trial also reciting her version of a 2015 fight at the couple’s downtown LA apartment and her striking the Pirates of the Caribbean actor.
“In all of my relationship to date with Johnny, I hadn’t landed a blow,” Heard told the Virginia courtroom of her efforts to stop Depp from knocking her sister down a flight of stairs in the mid-2015 event. “I hit him, square in the face.
“Sure, I had tried to fight back …but never landed anything,” the Aquaman actress calmly said as her ex-husband sat nearby between his lawyers, scribbling at the table right front of him. “Johnny looked stunned and laughed at me … security pulled him away.”

In the closing minutes of Thursday’s session in the five week long that started on April 11, Heard’s words today were part of a big picture position by her legal team to take the air out of Depp’s repeatedly claims that he was the abused one in the high profile couple’s relationship and marriage, that end in 2016 amidst retaining orders and more.

Recalling that December 15, 2015 altercation, Heard detailed being head butted by Depp.

“Punching me, punching me repeatedly with his fist, I don’t even remember the pain, just the sound of Johnny’s voice .. I f*cking hate you, over and over,” Heard asserted as Depp, their respective lawyers, the jury and Fairfax County Judge Penny Azcarte looked on. “Pounding the back of the head I could just hear him saying he was going to kill me, he sounded like an animal in pain,” Heard continued in a softer than usual voice as her Run Diary co-star once again avoided eye contact with her in the relatively small courtroom.

A photo of the seemingly bruised and broken nosed Heard in the days after the alleged assault in question was displayed for the court. In fact, with broken lips and more, a number of photographs of Heard depicting injuries from Depp’s alleged beating were shown to the jury and everyone else. The first fight between the couple that was discussed this afternoon supposedly kicked off when Heard discovered texts on Depp’s iPad between the actor and a woman he had been involved with previously. To Heard, the correspondence implied that Depp and the woman were involved once again.
Depp has sought to tarnish “slut” Heard, as he called her on a number of occasions, with being unfaithful during their relationship. Such accusations when the couple were together occurred when the actor was often in a drug and booze induced rage.

Claiming he never abused anyone, Depp sued Heard in March 2019 over a late 2018 Washington Post op-ed that she wrote on being a survivor of domestic abuse. Though the piece never named Depp, the past Oscar nominee claims it “devastated” his career and reputation and cost him big pay checks for big movies. Failing to get the case dismissed, Heard countersued her former spouse for $100 million in the summer of 2020. Later that year, Depp very publicly lost a UK libel suit he instigated against The Sun tabloid for calling him a “wife-beater.”

Earlier, calling the relationship “toxic,” 36-year old Heard denied that she had written on a mirror amidst the wreckage of the Australian rented house the couple initially live in during the filming of the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean flick in 2015. Depp’s team have sought to hang at least some of the destruction in the residence on Heard. “It seems significantly cleaned up,” Heard told her lawyer Elaine and the court of photos of the remnants of that “Australia incident.”

He asked if he had “killed it, meaning the relationship …is this done, is it over? Heard said of a call from Depp to her as the actress hurried the airport in Australia following the alleged violence there.

“My heart was broken .. I thought something might happen to him, like he might die, or kill himself,” Heard admitted of her thoughts of getting back in the relationship despite the alleged violence and sexual assaults. “I wanted to stay with the good Johnny that I loved ..so I decided to believe it would never happen again,” she told the court of making one more attempt at reconciliation in late 2015 for a Christmas family vacation at his private Bahamas island.

Not long after that trip began, a supposedly wine spilling Depp shoved Heard and threatened to “kill you” if she ever embarrassed him in front of his children again. Pausing for long stretches on the stand, Heard added, “he shoved his finger inside me through my bathing suit” while taunting her with “you think you are so tough?’ More violence seemingly followed, with Depp found “passed out” nearby the house the next morning

Finished now for day after going a bit longer than usual, the trial will not resume until May 16 because of a pre-scheduled conference the Judge has. Heard is expected to be subjected to cross examination soon after everyone returns to the court.

Before bringing the jury back in for the final portion of today’s trial, a time conscious Judge Azcarte asked the assembled lawyers if breaking traditional was alright with them and closing argument were held on May 27, a Friday – which is usually a dark day for the trial. Usually stating at 10 AM ET, the trial will now start at 9 AM ET when it returns.

Also, at the end of today’s court session, the judge told the lawyers that the plaintiff’s side had used up 35 hours and six minutes of their allotted time and the defense has used 36 hour and 31 minutes. Which leaves the Depp side with 26 hours and nine minutes remaining and the Heard side with 24 hours and 44 minutes left in case that is aiming to be done by Memorial Day. “Once your time is up, your time is up,” Judge Azcarte reminded the attorney and their respective Hollywood clients.

2nd UPDATE, 12:49 PM: “He told me he’d carve up my face,” Amber Heard told a Fairfax County jury that a broken bottle welding Johnny Depp said to her in a fight between the couple in Australia in March 2015.

Revealing that she herself smashed a bottle that her new and not all together sober husband supposedly taunted her with, Heard affirmed that Depp ripped her nightgown off, threw at least one goblet, and left her nakedly slipping on a floor of broken glass. She added that the Pirates of the Caribbean actor was screaming at her that “he f*cking hates me and I ruined his life” while punching the wall next to her. At another point, Heard said Depp was on top of her, screaming and “had me by the neck.”

“I’ll f*cking kill you, he said it over and over again,” Heard divulged Depp yelling at her as he allegedly penetrated her with a bottle “over and over again” during that time in Australia. Asking her lawyer Elaine Bredehoft not to pry too much, Heard expounded on the incident and bruises, bloody wounds and more she says she suffered.
Along with claims of physical, verbal and emotional abuse, Heard and her legal team have asserted that Depp sexually assaulted the actress repeatedly during their relationship. Depp has denied all such claims.

“I’ve never been so scared in my life,” the actress bellowed herself between sobs on the stand in front of Judge Penny Azcarte, the jury, Depp, lawyers and others of another clash between the couple. “I was trying to tell him he was really hurting me, I don’t think he knew what he was doing,” Heard said, before breaking down in the courtroom. “I couldn’t breathe.”

3rd UPDATE, 2:35 PM: “He’s going to kill me now,” Amber Heard told a Virginia jury today she thought to herself of an alleged late 2015 beating by Johnny Depp. “He’s going to kill me and he’s won’t’ even realize it.”

Along with those searing words and another story of an alleged sexual assault, Heard ended her second day of testimony in the $50 million defamation trial also reciting her version of a 2015 fight at the couple’s downtown LA apartment and her striking the Pirates of the Caribbean actor.

“In all of my relationship to date with Johnny, I hadn’t landed a blow,” Heard told the Virginia courtroom of her efforts to stop Depp from knocking her sister down a flight of stairs in the mid-2015 event. “I hit him, square in the face

“Sure, I had tried to fight back …but never landed anything,” the Aquaman actress calmly said as her ex-husband sat nearby between his lawyers, scribbling at the table right front of him. “Johnny looked stunned and laughed at me … security pulled him away.”

In the closing minutes of Thursday’s session in the five week long that started on April 11, Heard’s words today were part of a big picture position by her legal team to take the air out of Depp’s repeatedly claims that he was the abused one in the high profile couple’s relationship and marriage, that end in 2016 amidst retaining orders and more.

Recalling that December 15, 2015 altercation, Heard detailed being head butted by Depp.

“Punching me, punching me repeatedly with his fist, I don’t even remember the pain, just the sound of Johnny’s voice .. I f*cking hate you, over and over,” Heard asserted as Depp, their respective lawyers, the jury and Fairfax County Judge Penny Azcarte looked on. “Pounding the back of the head I could just hear him saying he was going to kill me, he sounded like an animal in pain,” Heard continued in a softer than usual voice as her Run Diary co-star once again avoided eye contact with her in the relatively small courtroom.

A photo of the seemingly bruised and broken nosed Heard in the days after the alleged assault in question was displayed for the court. In fact, with broken lips and more, a number of photographs of Heard depicting injuries from Depp’s alleged beating were shown to the jury and everyone else. The first fight between the couple that was discussed this afternoon supposedly kicked off when Heard discovered texts on Depp’s iPad between the actor and a woman he had been involved with previously. To Heard, the correspondence implied that Depp and the woman were involved once again.

Depp has sought to tarnish “slut” Heard, as he called her on a number of occasions, with being unfaithful during their relationship. Such accusations when the couple were together occurred when the actor was often in a drug and booze induced rage.

Claiming he never abused anyone, Depp sued Heard in March 2019 over a late 2018 Washington Post op-ed that she wrote on being a survivor of domestic abuse. Though the piece never named Depp, the past Oscar nominee claims it “devastated” his career and reputation and cost him big pay checks for big movies. Failing to get the case dismissed, Heard countersued her former spouse for $100 million in the summer of 2020. Later that year, Depp very publicly lost a UK libel suit he instigated against The Sun tabloid for calling him a “wife-beater.”

Earlier, calling the relationship “toxic,” 36-year old Heard denied that she had written on a mirror amidst the wreckage of the Australian rented house the couple initially live in during the filming of the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean flick in 2015. Depp’s team have sought to hang at least some of the destruction in the residence on Heard. “It seems significantly cleaned up,” Heard told her lawyer Elaine and the court of photos of the remnants of that “Australia incident.”

He asked if he had “killed it, meaning the relationship …is this done, is it over? Heard said of a call from Depp to her as the actress hurried the airport in Australia following the alleged violence there.

“My heart was broken .. I thought something might happen to him, like he might die, or kill himself,” Heard admitted of her thoughts of getting back in the relationship despite the alleged violence and sexual assaults. “I wanted to stay with the good Johnny that I loved ..so I decided to believe it would never happen again,” she told the court of making one more attempt at reconciliation in late 2015 for a Christmas family vacation at his private Bahamas island.

Not long after that trip began, a supposedly wine spilling Depp shoved Heard and threatened to “kill you” if she ever embarrassed him in front of his children again. Pausing for long stretches on the stand, Heard added, “he shoved his finger inside me through my bathing suit” while taunting her with “you think you are so tough?’ More violence seemingly followed, with Depp found “passed out” nearby the house the next morning

Finished now for day after going a bit longer than usual, the trial will not resume until May 16 because of a pre-scheduled conference the Judge has. Heard is expected to be subjected to cross examination soon after everyone returns to the court.

Before bringing the jury back in for the final portion of today’s trial, a time conscious Judge Azcarte asked the assembled lawyers if breaking traditional was alright with them and closing argument were held on May 27, a Friday – which is usually a dark day for the trial. Usually stating at 10 AM ET, the trial will now start at 9 AM ET when it returns.

Also, at the end of today’s court session, the judge told the lawyers that the plaintiff’s side had used up 35 hours and six minutes of their allotted time and the defense has used 36 hour and 31 minutes. Which leaves the Depp side with 26 hours and nine minutes remaining and the Heard side with 24 hours and 44 minutes left in case that is aiming to be done by Memorial Day. “Once your time is up, your time is up,” Judge Azcarte reminded the attorney and their respective Hollywood clients.

2nd UPDATE, 12:49 PM: “He told me he’d carve up my face,” Amber Heard told a Fairfax County jury that a broken bottle welding Johnny Depp said to her in a fight between the couple in Australia in March 2015.

Along with claims of physical, verbal and emotional abuse, Heard and her legal team have asserted that Depp sexually assaulted the actress repeatedly during their relationship. Depp has denied all such claims.

“I’ve never been so scared in my life,” the actress bellowed herself between sobs on the stand in front of Judge Penny Azcarte, the jury, Depp, lawyers and others of another clash between the couple. “I was trying to tell him he was really hurting me, I don’t think he knew what he was doing,” Heard said, before breaking down in the courtroom. “I couldn’t breathe.”

Waking up to a blood and blue and brown paint stain house, with a “incoherent” message and what she thought was her name, and smeared food everywhere, Heard on Thursday painted a now familiar portrait of destruction that the jurors have been exposed to since the trial started on April 11.

“He wasn’t there anymore, it wasn’t Johnny,” she said of the expression in her then spouse’s face that day as she “figured out” Depp was missing part of his finger.

Depp’s deeply wounded digit has long been an inflection of contention in the 2016 divorced couple’s relationship and this much-delayed trial. Both sides say the other was responsible to the injury that shut down production on Disney’s big budgeted fifth Pirates movie. On the stand, Heard said that after Depp pissed outside the dwelling to “send her more messages,” a nurse tried to give her drugs to calm her down.

“I just remember being scared …not knowing what the Hell was going on,” Heard went on to say, telling the court that she soon afterwards grabbed what ever she could and left Australia.

From the harrowing testimony from the Aquaman star this afternoon in the Virginia courtroom, the beginning of that time down under in March 2015 while Depp was working on the rocky filming of Dead Men Tell No Tales was a relentless round of fights between the couple. Strategically, Heard’s defense team are using their client’s testimony to try to diffuse Deep’s assertion that he was the abused one in the relationship by putting her actions and outbursts in a reactive pose.

Using language that the jury have heard before from the stand and on audio tapes, Heard claimed Depp insulted her as a “fat ass,” “whore” and saying no one in his circle liked her. Amongst all that, there seemed to be one violent physical confrontation after another with an apparently enraged and under the influence Deep choking Heard, pushing her up against walls, knocking her to the ground and “whacking me in the face.”

At one point, Heard exclaimed a “belligerent” and apparently fight seeking Depp screamed at her: “You wanna go, little girl!”

Heard also detailed an allegedly raging on the phone Depp telling n lawyer of Heard’s from Australia that “the only way out of this was death.” The past Oscar nominee made the ominous statement to a lawyer that Heard had hired to review documents around the couple’s recent marriage. On that same call, Depp fired Heard’s then attorney

“I was back on the chopping block,” Heard bluntly said.

Earlier on Thursday, for the first time since his ex-wife took the stand, a shaken Depp took off his sunglasses with a pursed look on his face as Heard broke down sobbing recollecting an allegedly violent incident in Tokyo around the time of the January 205 Mortdecai premiere.

However, Depp did look aside for a brief moment to flash a closed mouth smile off to his right where lawyer Ben Chew was seated. Soon after, as Heard detailed the couple’s private and semi-private 2015 wedding, an agitated Depp lifted up from writing on the table in front of him and leaned over to whisper to Chew. Later, as evidence of the debris and fallout of the March 2015 fight at the rented house in Australia was posted on the courtroom monitors, a gum chewing Depp conferred over and over with Chew, sometimes pointing at the screen directly in front of him

Sure to wrap up the last day of the trial until May 16, Heard will return for more testimony after the current break the court is on.

1st UPDATE, 10:10 AM: On the 15th day of Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation trial against Amber Heard, the Aquaman star told the Virginia courtroom how things between herself and the Pirates of the Caribbean actor “really weren’t okay…I was just catering to his mood” during his 2014 detox from Oxycontin.

“I said something to him, he got so angry and slapped me across the face,” a sometimes crying and voice-cracking Heard said Thursday in her second day of testimony. “But it was so weird, he was crying…no women had embarrassed me like that,” the actress added, as a mainly downcast and scribbling Depp sat nearby with his lawyers.

Though at one point, as Heard described the events in the Bahamas eight years ago, Depp did become quite animated and leaned over to attorney Ben Chew. At another junction, as he had yesterday, Depp giggled and snickered like a schoolboy with Chew as Heard today detailed the increasing controlling behavior Depp displayed over her. Specifically, Heard described the criteria he demanded she meet to be in the 2015 released Magic Mike XXL

Recalling the Bahamas detox process Heard declared, “I deeply cared about this human’s well-being…it was very confusing and scary,” noting the praise that Depp gave her. “He told me all the time I save his life, he wouldn’t be doing this without me,” she said. Later, as Depp’s lawyers let loose with their constant battery of objections and “hearsay” calls, Heard’s lead lawyer Elaine Bredehoft introduced a post-detox text from Depp to Heard where the actor called his partner an ”angel” for helping him.
“He never had to deal with the clean-up…he never had to deal with my face the next day,” a tearful Heard told the court later in her testimony.

In her short stint on the stand so far, Heard has leveled a number of allegations of abuse, in many forms, against Depp – including sexual assault. The Black Mass actor’s drug and alcohol use sits at the heart of most of those allegations, with Depp turning into a self-described “monster” when under the influence. “I’m a f*cking savage,” Depp wrote Heard in a December 18, 2018 text.

That “was the language he used after a particularly violent episode,” Heard explained to Judge Penny Azcarte, the jury and others in the Fairfax County Courthouse. “Sometime I don’t think he understood how much he could hurt me physically,” she added, admitting that she “yelled at him, screaming at him…it was awful.”

“Nothing I did made him stop hitting me.”

Throughout the trial, which began on April 11, Depp and his various paid witnesses have denied the actor had serious problem with booze and drugs. Claiming cocaine and other such intake had little actual effect on him — which kind of undermines the point of taking it — Depp has copped to an opioid addiction, which he says he conquered. He also has admitted that Heard was by his side during his 2014 detox and he was thankful for that.

Still, from the moment he launched his March 2019 lawsuit against Heard over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed the actress wrote about being a survivor of domestic abuse, Depp has denied he abused Heard. Despite losing a 2020 UK libel suit against the tabloid The Sun for calling him a “wife-beater,” Depp continues to proclaim he is the victim of domestic abuse in the relationship with Heard – even though the couple’s very public and restraining order filled 2016 divorce indicated otherwise.

The court in on its lunch break now. Today is the last day the trial will be in session this week and it will pause all the next week for a pre-scheduled conference Judge Azcarte is attending. Testimony will pick up again on May 16.

PREVIOUSLY, 8:56 AM: Amber Heard alleged more instances of physical abuse by Johnny Depp today, painting a picture of a dream relationship turning into a nightmare as the actor descended into drug and alcohol binges.

Just before a morning break on Thursday, the jury listened to an audio recording that Heard said she took of Depp on a May 24, 2014 private flight from Boston, in which Depp is heard moaning. Heard said he had locked himself in the bathroom aand “started howling like an animal.”

Heard explained that she started recording because “in my experience, when Johnny was that inebriated, he would not remember what was done.”

Depp is suing Heard for $50 million over a Washington Post op ed she wrote in 2018, in which she said that she had become “a public figure representing domestic abuse.” Depp denies her claims of domestic abuse.

Heard, who has countersued, took the stand on Wednesday, and has since been going through a narrative of their relationship, describing instances where Depp was emotionally a physically abusive to her.

On the May, 2014 flight, she said, Depp was upset that she was doing a movie with James Franco, whom he despised, and that she had a love scene with him. At one point on the flight, Heard alleged that Depp started throwing ice cubes and utensils at her, “talking about what an embarrassment I am.” She said that she tried to avoid engaging with him, but “Johnny came to me each time.”

“I was looking out the window and he slaps my face,” Heard said, looking at the jury most times as she testified.

She said that a friend was in close proximity, and although the slap “didn’t hurt me,” “I was just embarrassed that he would do that in front of people.”

Then, she said, as she went to move to the front of the plane, she turned away and “I feel this boot in my back. He just kicked me…I thought to myself. ‘I don’t know what to do.’ No one said anything. No one did anything. I felt so embarrassed that he could do that in front of people.”

Heard also described an incident earlier that month, when they both attended the Met Gala. She said that at the dinner, Depp thought she was “looking at this woman in a sexual way.”

In their hotel room afterward, she said, Depp shoved her and grabbed her by the area around her collar bone. She said that she then shoved him back, and “he threw a bottle at me. It missed me but broke the chandelier.” She said that they then had a struggle in the living room and he shoved her down on a sofa “and at some point he just whacks me in the face.”

“I suspected I had a broken nose. Other than that I was relatively unscathed,” Heard said. As it turned out, she said, her nose was discolored.

Depp again did not make eye contact with his ex-wife and instead looked down and appeared to be writing.

Heard described how, in August, 2013, when Depp proposed to her, and the joy she felt. “I looked into his eyes and saw my future and hope, like blind hope.”
“I thought if we were married, this is real, it’s not chaotic, this will change,” she said.

The next March, they held an engagement party and invited a large group of family and friends. They walked in together but Depp “disappeared upstairs almost the entire party.” He was sharing drugs with her dad, Heard said.

“My dad at the time was addicted to the same thing Johnny was,” she said. She said at one point her dad left with Depp’s security guard to get drugs in West Hollywood.

“I tried to get Johnny to come downstairs and he just snapped at me, verbally told me to shut the f— up,” Heard said. “I remember talking to my mom about the irony of it.”

Amber Heard: Johnny Depp ‘tried to kill me many times’!Heard, 34, described an incident in January 2015 in a hotel room in Tokyo over a prenuptial agreement between herself and Depp, and suggested there was an argument about it.

She testified there was an argument in the hotel room in Tokyo that resulted in Depp, 57, kneeling on her back and hitting her on the back of the head.

“But then Johnny was also accusing me of having an affair with a co-star, and that is what led to the actual argument,” she said.
In written testimony released as she took to the witness box, Heard said she worried Depp would kill her at various times during their relationship, which allegedly saw her enduring “punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking.”

“Johnny attacked me a lot of times, on many different occasions,” she said.
Heard also said: “Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far.”

When asked whether she had a problem controlling her temper, Heard said: “I did have outbursts of anger at times. Yes, I lost my cool with Johnny in our fights.”

According to Heard, Depp “explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship.”

She also said that he blamed his actions on “a self-created third party” that he referred to as “the monster.”

Johnny Depp Trial: Amber Heard claims Depp previously pushed his ex girlfriend Kate Moss down the stairs !
Amber Heard mentioned Johnny Depp's past relationship with Kate Moss while testifying during their ongoing defamation trial.

The actress took the stand on Thursday and spoke about one of her fights with Depp in March 2015. She shared that she “instantly” thought of ""Kate Moss and stairs” during the altercation with Depp involving her sister Whitney.
Heard said she struck Depp with a can of Red Bull and yelled at him, which prompted him to become enraged. She then claimed that Depp followed her up a staircase and grabbed her when her sister Whitney intervened in the fight.The Aquaman star also alleged that Depp swung at Whitney, which led her to think about the Kate Moss stairs incident:

    ""She threw herself in the line of fire. She was trying to get Johnny to stop. Her back was to the staircase, and Johnny swings at her... I don’t hesitate and wait; I instantly think of Kate Moss and stairs.""Heard stated that the then situation forced her to hit Depp for the first time during their relationship:

    ""I, for the first time, hit him, square in the face. And he didn’t push my sister down the stairs. Up to that point in our relationship, I hadn’t even landed one on Johnny.""

She further claimed that Depp ""looked stunned,"" ""laughed,"" and allegedly ""lunged"" towards her again before being stopped by security staff.
A look into Johnny Depp and Kate Moss' staircase incident

During the 2020 UK libel trial between Johnny Depp and The Sun, Amber Heard claimed that she heard rumors about the actor pushing Kate Moss down the stairs while they were dating in the 1990s:

    ""He pushed Kate Moss down the stairs, I heard this from two people, and this was fresh in my mind.""Heard said that the rumored incident prompted her to hit Depp to defend her sister Whitney while they were engaged in a staircase fight in 2015:

    ""I reacted in defense of my sister. I had for years been Johnny's punchbag, but for years, I never hit him. It was the first time after all these years that I struck him back.""
During a 2012 interview with Vanity Fair, Moss said her separation from Depp was a ""nightmare"":

    ""There's nobody that's ever really been able to take care of me. Johnny did for a bit. I believed what he said. Like if I said, 'What do I do?' he'd tell me. And that's what I missed when I left. I really lost that gauge of somebody I could trust. Nightmare. Years and years of crying. Oh, the tears!""
Depp took responsibility for his split with Moss while speaking on their relationship to Hello!Magazine:

    ""I have never got that emotional over a woman before. I have been so stupid because we had so much going for our relationship. I'm the one who has to take responsibility for what happened—I was difficult to get on with, I let my work get in the way, and I didn't give her the attention I should have.""
Prior to their break-up, Johnny Depp was once arrested for trashing a hotel room with Kate Moss inside in 1994. At the time, the pair was also photographed screaming at each other in public.
In the current trial, it became known that Johnny Depp publicly and constantly insulted his ex-girlfriend Vanessa Paradis, who had previously defended him.
Johnny Depp called his ex-girlfriend Vanessa Paradis a ""blackmailing French s***"" in an email to Elton John, Amber Heard's lawyers have now found. Is his ex-girlfriend now turning against him in court?
It doesn't look good for Johnny Depp (58): In a freshly leaked email to Elton, the actor insults his ex Vanessa Paradis (49) and says she's trying to ""brainwash"" their two children: Paradis is finally going to turn against him and finally show solidarity with abused women?
Moderator Howard Stern calls Johnny Depp a ""big narcissist"". He's damn right about that, but unfortunately Johnny Depp still has a lot of supporters as do all perpetrators.
The trial in America will set global trends in how female victims and male perpetrators will be treated in the future.

Chris Brown was arrested and placed on probation for assaulting his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, who had to be hospitalized -- her injuries were that bad.

Johnny Depp
Depp's wife, Amber Heard, filed a restraining order -- and then divorce papers! -- on the grounds that he abused her throughout their marriage. Among other things, Heard alleged that Depp smashed an iPhone into her face, resulting in bruising. He abused and denounced her throughout the marriage and continues to haunt her for years after the divorce with hate, slander, and humiliating lawsuits in a terrifying manner.

Columbus Short

Christian Bale
In 2008, the ""Batman"" star was arrested for allegedly assaulting both his mother and sister in a hotel room. Bale denied the charges, and none were levied against him.

Famous People Who Got Away With Murder:

Max Linder
“He will kill me,” Hélène “Jean” Peters confided to her mother. Shortly later, her lifeless body was found next to husband Max Linder’s. All signs suggest she was right.
Max Linder was the original movie star. Appearing in dozens of short films at the turn of the 20th century, Linder’s character “Max” was the first internationally known role of the cinema age. Admirers like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd heavily borrowed from Linder’s brand of physical comedy. The humor masked a vindictive spirit.
Following his service as a dispatch driver in World War I, Linder returned in a deep depression. He tried to suppress his sorrow by marrying Hélène “Jean” Peters, a woman half his age. The marriage did little to relieve his problems. In February 1924, the couple accidentally overdosed on barbiturates. When they slashed their wrists a year later, most believed it was a suicide pact. Daughter Maud Linder proposes Peters did not go willing. In her memoir, Maud recounted a worker that overheard her father tell a friend that he planned on killing his wife, so that nobody else could date her.[

Burt Reynolds
In the 1973 western “The Man who Loved Cat Dancing,” Burt Reynolds’ Jay Grobart is a protector. When Sarah Miles’ Catherine escapes an abusive lover, Grobart takes the law into his own hands. Perhaps a real-life version of this story played out on the movie set.
As filming wrapped up on February 11, 1973, Miles accompanied Reynolds to his room for a nightcap. Around 3’oclock in the morning, she sauntered into her and manager, and occasional lover, David Whiting’s room. An enraged and jealous Whiting struck her. She fled to Reynolds’ room for the night. By the next morning, Whiting was dead in a pool of his blood.
Ignoring the scratches and abrasions on his hands and body, medical examiners believed a despondent Whiting overdosed. Reynolds tracked his footprints through the scene to retrieve the vial of red tablets Whiting died clasping. The vial was subsequently lost. Due to inconsistencies about her location that night and if Whiting and her fought, Miles was called to testify. MGM initially prevented Miles and Reynolds from speaking, citing the financial strain the delay might cause. Eventually, the two spoke at the inquest. Neither deposition explained where all the blood came from.

Jerry Lee Lewis
On August 23, 1983, Shawn Michelle Lewis made two phone calls. The first was to her mother saying she was thinking of leaving newlywed musical madman Jerry Lee Lewis. The second was to her high school sweetheart’s sister. The two discussed plans to escape Mississippi and her abusive marriage. In the middle of talking, the phone went dead. The next day, Shawn Lewis was dead too.
DeSoto County police officers discovered Shawn’s corpse neatly placed on top of the guestroom bed. The “Great Balls of Fire” singer staggered over bleeding from scratch marks on his hand. There was blood on the walls, carpet, and both party’s clothes. Jerry’s skin and blood was found underneath Shawn’s broken fingernails. Her arm was punctured similarly to the wounds Jerry had from injecting himself with daily chemical cocktails. Glass shards were strewn around the house. For one hour, the deputy sheriff a private discussion with DeSoto County’s biggest celebrity. The coroner ruled it was an accidental methadone overdose. None of the physical evidence was admitted to the grand jury. The grand jury did not find any sign of foul play. Jerry Lee Lewis was free to go back on tour as “The Killer.”

Adolf Hitler
At least one person thought Adolf Hitler was not a monster. She was proven wrong. To teenager Geli Raubal, Hitler functioned as a surrogate father figure, affectionally referred to as “Uncle Alfie.” Displaying rare compassion, Hitler took great interest in raising his half-niece by supporting her dreams of singing professionally. Those feelings morphed into obsession. Rumors speculate that the two had an incestuous affair. Hitler limited Raubal from contacting people. On September 18, 1931, Hitler and Raubal publicly fought about his controlling nature. Raubal started a letter promising a friend she would soon abandon her uncle in Munich. In midsentence, in midword, she took out Hitler’s personal gun and shot herself in the chest.
Bavarian minister of justice Franz Gürtner bungled the investigation. Evidence suggesting a quarrel, such as bruises and a broken nose, were overlooked. Without a suicide note, Nazi press passed the dubious story that she killed herself over an upcoming music recital. A rogue investigation by the public prosecutor’s office was quashed. The body was promptly buried in a Catholic cemetery, despite the fact that the religious owners barred burying suicide victims. Fifty stormtroopers ransacked reporter Frtiz Gerlich’s office after alleging Hitler pulled the trigger. Gerlich was sent to Dachau, the prison camp where he died in 1942. Hitler, of course, caused much more death. It is interesting to think how history could have changed if he had been caught the first time he did.

O. J. Simpson 
The People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson was a criminal trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court in which former National Football League (NFL) player, broadcaster and actor O. J. Simpson was tried and acquitted for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The pair were evil and cruel stabbed to death outside Brown's condominium in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on the night of June 12, 1994. The trial spanned eleven months, from the jury's swearing-in on November 9, 1994. Opening statements were made on January 24, 1995, and Simpson was acquitted of both counts of murder on October 3 of the same year.The trial is often characterized as the trial of the century because of its international publicity and has been described as the ""most publicized"" criminal trial in history.
Following perfunctory questioning by police detectives, Simpson was formally charged with the murders on June 17, 1994, after investigators found a blood-stained glove on his property. After he did not turn himself in at the agreed time, he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 Ford Bronco SUV owned and driven by his friend Al Cowlings. TV stations interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals to broadcast live coverage of the pursuit, which was watched by an estimated 95 million people. The pursuit and Simpson's subsequent arrest were among the most widely publicized events in American history.
Simpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, referred to as the ""Dream Team,"" which was initially led by Robert Shapiro and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team also included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald Uelmen. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence. While Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman, and Christopher Darden believed they had a strong case against Simpson, Cochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt concerning the DNA evidence in this case, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time. The reasonable doubt theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits. Cochran and the defense team also alleged other misconduct by the LAPD related to racism and incompetence, in particular actions and comments of Detective Mark Fuhrman.
The trial became historically significant because of the reaction to the verdict. Although the nation observed the same evidence presented at trial, a division along racial lines emerged in observers' opinions of the verdict, which the media dubbed the ""racial gap."" A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African-Americans thought that justice had been served by the ""not guilty"" verdict, while the majority of Whites thought it was a racially motivated jury nullification by a mostly African-American jury. More recent polling shows the ""gap"" has narrowed since the trial, with over half of polled black respondents in 2013 stating they believed Simpson was guilty.
After the trial, Goldman's father filed a civil suit against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for the deaths of both Goldman and Brown. The Goldman family was awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million ($56.5 million in 2021 dollars), but have received only a small portion of that mon",0,0,Event,32825193,1,comment,2022-05-08T13:38:50Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],32825193,32825193,"Fire Bob Chapek, Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada",2022-03-26T20:43:37Z,,2022-03-26T20:43:37Z,2022-08-07T05:13:30Z,en-US,['en'],"Fire Bob Chapek, Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada","<p><strong>Bob Chapek</strong> has done a lot of screw ups with his continuous strike of bad decision's after bad decisions; including not releasing Turning Red in theaters and denying people from seeing one of the best Animated films in 3D ever, but his decision in this past month to still fund <strong>Anti-Homosexuals Politicians</strong> after their push &amp; passage of <strong>Don't Say Gay Bill</strong> has gone too far. The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>

The Board @ <strong>Disney </strong>should Fire him.</p>
<p><strong>Toby Emmerich</strong> has been President since as far back as 2017, he has went out of his way to not do anything about Joss Whedon abuse of Blacks &amp; Jews (i.e. Ray Fisher, Gal Gadot), from Whedon's abuse of actor Ray Fisher, to Whedon threatening to end Gal Gadot's whole career. Instead of punishing Joss Whedon for his constant abuses from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Justice League, <strong>Walter Hamada actively discouraged 3rd Party investigations into Joss Whedon. </strong>Their punishing Ray Fisher and sidelined the Cyborg movie into hiatus, and has never apologize or anything to Gal Gadot for the abuses she suffer by Joss Whedon, and has refused any investigation into the Justice League's cast accusations of abuse. He has refused to allow female lead movies like Birds of Prey and Those Who Wish Me Dead to release in 3D, despite already having a 3D Master (copy) of Birds of Prey, and now he refuses to release any movie with Positive Female Role Models in 3D like Mortal Kombat, Matrix Resurrections, The Batman and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in 3D despite there already being a 3D Copy/Master of all these movies. Make no mistake, he's using this as an excuse so these movies will make less money, so he can say no one would watch these movies because of their diversity and positive female role models and no Johnny Depp, so he can get rid of Diversity and Positive Female role models in newer movies, and bring back abuser Johnny Depp into Warner Bros movies after the U.K. Libel suit has revealed heavily documented police reports/documentation of Johnny Depp's physical abuses to Amber Heard from 2013 thru 2016. Toby Emmerich is a schemer, and he scheming to recast Ray Fisher, getting rid of diversity and positive female characters in movies and getting Johnny Depp cast into movies once again. He's been sabotaging Warner Bros movies Box Office success by releasing them in 2D Only, and then using that to say that people don't want to watch a movie with diversity, positive female role models that has no Johnny Depp in it. Its because of Toby Emmerich decision to never release a movie in 3D ever again that Birds of Prey, Mortal Kombat (2021), The Suicide Squad (2021), Reminiscence, Matrix Resurrections haven't made any money, and why The Batman (2022) made half or less of how much it could have made. By not releasing the 3D copy of The Batman to include 3D screenings, not only has the movie make less money than expectations, but <strong>Toby Emmerich has scapegoated </strong><strong>Matt Reeves and Cancelled his Gotham/Arkham series. And now Fantastic Beasts 3 will be release in 2D only and therefore won't make much money, and Toby Emmerich will use this as an excuse to either cancel Fantastic Beasts 4 and 5, or cast Johnny Depp back in the role of Grindelward.</strong> Hell it's because of Toby Emmerich that he allowed James Gunn to do the Suicide Squad 2 in 2D only, even though 3D+ (3D with select scenes in HFR/High Frame Rate) would fix any &amp; all issues with Quick Cut Scenes and Blurring issues, even with a High Frame Rate conversion to go with the 3D conversion. <strong>And now he's planning on sabotaging Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Production company by releasing his 3 movies in 2022 (DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods) in Monoscopic 2D Only, despite there already being a Stereoscopic 3D Master of these 3 Dwayne Johnson movies. Make no mistake, Toby Emmerich is probably going to scapegoat Dwayne Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions for any weak Box Office performance of DC League of Super-petS, Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. Mr. Emmerich is following in his fellow businessman's footsteps; Donald Trump to ""Make 2D Great Again"". Toby Emmerich won't greenlit the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad 1 (2016) to put on HBOMAX even though its already filmed and only needs CGI work done, which is a $10 million expense. Let alone the Schumacher Cut of Batman (90's) which would cost $0 to $1 million to do for another HBOMAX exclusive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: Domestic Abuse survivor; Amber Heard just had a lot of her action scenes cut out of Aquaman 2 because of sexist Walter Hamada and Misogynist Toby Emmerich. Women deserve to be action stars too. Johnny Depp is ever increasingly obviously guilty with each lawsuit, from his U.K. Libel Suit to his now current lawsuit which stinks of guilty-ness as he's suing Amber Heard for a anonymous op-ed that is allegedly from Amber Heard that is supposedly about him. Its clearly a stunt by Johnny Depp to drag his victim to hell and back, as soo many domestic abusers do. So return Amber Heard's action scenes in Aquaman the Lost Kingdom back into the script and film them, since the movie doesn't even come out til March or April 2023 anyways.</strong></p>
<p><em>update 2: Good News; Disney stood up for minorities and is releasing their Pixar movies in theaters in 3D again. And both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada will be gone from Warner Bros. later this year.</em> <strong>Bad News; misogynist Toby Emmerich on his way out has removed a lot of Amber Heard's action scenes from Aquaman the Lost Kingdom despite the physical video evidence proving its Amber Heard who was the victim (because physical tangible evidence doesn't matter to anti-science misogynist). So i will keep this Petition open until Amber Heard gets her action scenes put back into the movie, and Warner Bros starts releasing their new movies in 3D and IMAX 3D like all the other studios that have thankfully already started releasing all their new movies in 3D + IMAX 3D (stop being stingy Warner Bros, and stop your ""anti-consumer/anti-domstic abuse survivors"" practice) and Disney+ Marvel Studios Kevin Feige fixes She Hulk's CGI so she has muscles (another Sonic The Hedgehog CGI situation. Can't executives stop ruining VFX CGI characters design).</strong></p>
