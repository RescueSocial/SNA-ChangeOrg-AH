StarterPetitionUpdate,30580344,2022-05-22T21:27:41.000Z,Case Update,"<p>Johnny Depp's new lawyer, Camille Vasquez, has started to cross examine Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The Orange County-based attorney is representing Depp in his $50 million defamation suit against his ex-wife Amber Heard over a 2018 op-ed she penned for The Washington Post insinuating she was a survivor of domestic abuse. Though not mentioned by name in the op-ed, Depp accused Heard of costing him acting roles and tarnishing his reputation in the entertainment industry. Heard is countersuing for $100 million. </p>
<p>At one point of the cross-examination, Vasquez asked Heard about the $7 million divorce settlement she received in October 2018 following her split from Depp, which Heard pledged to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Upon this questioning, Amber Heard seemed to try and get away from denying that she DONATED it. Also, as part of the cross examination, Camille questioned Amber about an incident that happened while Amber and Johnny were in Australia. Vasquez asked Heard about her statement saying that Johnny Depp assaulted her whilst pinning her down into a counter and proceeded to hit her with a bottle. The questions Vasquez asked what when did Johnny grab the bottle, before of after? But all Amber claimed was that he had the bottle in his hand while he was hitting her with it. This question was repeated about five times with the same answers. We will see what the next week brings. </p>
