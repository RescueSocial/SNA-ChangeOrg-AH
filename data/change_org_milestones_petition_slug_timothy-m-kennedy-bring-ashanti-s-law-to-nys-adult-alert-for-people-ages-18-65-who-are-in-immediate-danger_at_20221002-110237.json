Thank you to everyone who has supported bringing Ashanti\u2019s Law to NY in honor of a Tiara Lott. An alert for missing adults ages 18-65 who are in immediate danger. This will be a big support in domestic violence situations. This has been a wonderful community effort. We have shown you don\u2019t need the fake support of leaders who pretend to get real work accomplished. We have spoken to the department of justice on our next steps. We also received some national attention and surprising emails from people who want to support whose platforms are bigger then any of the advocates or politicians here in Buffalo who haven\u2019t even signed the petition to bring this law to NY. God is truly on our side. Thank you to Meltony Billie for supporting our efforts and being an amazing advocate for his daughter Ashanti Billie. We need to care and protect our women all the time.... not just when something happens. We need laws that protect us!! We need leaders who care about our lives at all the times... not just when a tragedy occurs . Tiara Lott\u2019s name and story is still just as important now as it was when she went missing in February. Thank you WGRZ - Channel 2, Buffalo Claudine Euwing for reporting the full length story on your community segment! This has helped with the national support! \u2764\ufe0f This is what a community that is fighting for change and not a name looks like!
