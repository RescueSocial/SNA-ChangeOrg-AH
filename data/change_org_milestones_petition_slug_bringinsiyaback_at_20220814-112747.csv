StarterPetitionUpdate,22924395,2018-06-24T17:38:15.000Z,THIS IS THE REASON WHY INSIYA IS STILL KIDNAPPED..,"To get her daughter Insiya back, Nadia has been forced to fight for her daughter through court in India. In January 2018 the Indian judge finally ordered Insiya to be returned to her mother on the 27th of March 2018. Insiya was finally going to be home. But that didn't happen. The Mumbai High Court overturned this decision in April 2018 following the misleading appeal made by Insiya’s kidnapper. 
This High Court order has forced Nadia to continue fighting and exhaust every legal remedy by going to the Supreme Court of India in New Delhi.  It is very important to cancel this court order of the Mumbai High Court, otherwise Insiya cannot come back home and it is the only hope Nadia has left. Nadia cannot and must not give up on her daughter. Going to the Supreme Court of India is her only hope.  

HOW CAN YOU HELP
In order to get her daughter back Nadia is facing with mounting legal expenses. The ongoing legal battle is costly and long and she needs all the help she can get. To help her fight this injustice we started this campaign at Whydonate.nl, so we can help Nadia cover some of her legal expenses to bring Insiya back home, where she belongs. We are raising money through Whydonate so we can help her with her legal expense in order to fight for justice.

StarterPetitionUpdate,21514357,2017-09-29T07:14:16.000Z,One year since Insiya was brutally kidnapped and she is still not back,"Today it is exactly one year ago since my 2-year-old daughter Insiya was kidnapped from Amsterdam and smuggled to Mumbai. Insiya was brutally snatched away from her loving mother, just because I refused to put up with an abusive marriage. Life has been a rollercoaster of challenges ever since. 

In that one year I have not left any stone unturned to get her back home. And you have supported me every step of the way. With your immense support for this petition we have collected more than 41.000 signatures in a very short span of time. You have seen, liked and shared my video message over 1 million times. Because of your help we made the Dutch and Indian authorities sit together, collaborate and talk about this unbearable situation that Insiya has been put into. Talk about reaching milestones….. 

Despite all this, we are nowhere near the real goal: for Insiya to come back home to The Netherlands, where she belongs. In this past year I have had no contact with my daughter. I don’t know what she looks like now and how she is doing. I have missed Insiya’s kisses and cuddles… So many first words and stories that she must have wanted to share with her mother. Insiya has been deprived of her mother’s love. A cruelty that nobody can imagine. No child should experience this ever.

My love and quest for Insiya will never fade… I am focused and determined to get my daughter back. I will never give up fighting for my daughter, for she is counting on me. The immeasurable love I have for my child, is the strength that keeps me going. Even in the toughest time of my life. 

Many of you have reached out to me with your prayers and well wishes; and I am grateful for that. Please keep supporting me and my daughter Insiya. Please help me share this message. Because together we can make the change.

Thank you, 

Nadia
