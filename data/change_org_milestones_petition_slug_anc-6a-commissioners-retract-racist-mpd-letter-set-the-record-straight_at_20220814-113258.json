We demand the following steps to begin rebuilding trust with the community.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We demand that the Commission reserve significant time on next month\u2019s meeting agenda to address these issues, and that such meeting include substantial time for community input. Alternatively, we demand a separate town hall, properly noticed and allowing for significant community input, for the ANC 6A on these issues. <strong>Neither of these demands have been met.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>We demand that ANC 6A correct the record by writing another letter to Chairman Mendelson and the D.C. Council, and to Mayor Bowser. This second letter should clearly acknowledge the devastating impact the MPD has on many DC residents, including ANC 6A residents, and state that the Commission\u2019s initial letter was sent without the Commission soliciting input from its constituents, per DC statute. <strong>This demand has also not been met.</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What Happened?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On June 11, 2020, ANC 6A voted to approve a letter in support of MPD and in opposition to widespread calls to defund MPD, without proper notice in the <a href=\"https://anc6a.org/wp-content/uploads/ANCA0620.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ANC 6A agenda</a>.\u00a0</li>\n<li>On June 14, 2020, ANC 6A sent this letter to the D.C. Council without a comment period, ensuring there would be no constituent input on the subject.\u00a0</li>\n<li>On July 9, 2020, ANC 6A actively silenced residents in the monthly ANC 6A meeting by <a href=\"https://dcnet.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/dcnet/recording/play/43d32dc7c1954e96b320c7b4ab888519\" rel=\"nofollow\">not allowing for public comment</a>, a clear abdication of section 1-309.11(b)(3) of the <a href=\"https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/1-309.11.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">DC Official Code</a>.</li>\n<li>On July 29, 2020, ANC 6A residents who opposed the Commission\u2019s egregious actions sent a letter to the Commissioners with their demands.</li>\n<li>A Community Outreach Committee meeting was scheduled by ANC 6A for August 24th. This session is <strong>not</strong> a separate town wall, as listed in our demands.</li>\n</ul>", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27475069", "createdAt": "2020-08-07T23:58:53.000Z", "signatureCount": 50}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27454103", "createdAt": "2020-08-05T05:48:05.000Z", "title": "Media Coverage in Hill Rag + How to Get More Involved!", "description": "<p>Dear Supporters,</p>\n<p>Great news!
