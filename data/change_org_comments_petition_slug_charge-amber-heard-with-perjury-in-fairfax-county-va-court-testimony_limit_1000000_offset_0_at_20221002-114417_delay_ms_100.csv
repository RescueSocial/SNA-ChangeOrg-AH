<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725.

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction.

A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other.

Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court.

There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself.

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016.

Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court.

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction.

A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence.

<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other.

Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
<p>     All of the petitioners whose signature are on this petition, demand Ms. Heard be criminally investigated for perjury related to her testimony in a Fairfax County Virginia Court, case number CL-2019-0002911.</p>
<p>Respectfully, </p>
<p>Concerned Citizens for Justice! </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case.

Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction. Out judicial system must hold everyone to the highest standards while ensuring those that don’t are held responsible. A witness taking an oath to tell the truth is one of the vital parts when ensuring a fair impartial trial. Allowing a witness to lie with no attempt to hold said person responsible, risks damaging the integrity of our judicial system as a whole. Providing false testimony along with altered and or tampered with evidence is a serious offense. This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen. This shouldn’t and can’t be a valid legal reason to avoid charging someone with perjury, it’s ability to obtain a conviction is difficult. If this theory was applied to other crimes such as murder, would we allow people to kill each other simply because obtaining a conviction my be difficult? No, that wouldn’t be allowed and a person would be charged no matter how difficult it is. </p>
<p><br>     Any type of perjury shall be enforced no matter how difficult it may be to secure a conviction. Not charging a person that knowingly commits perjury is a high risk to the judicial system as a whole. This type of violation is the highest form of disrespect to the judicial system. This takes away a persons ability to have a fair trial under the United States Constitution. Having a fair trial is your constitutionally protected right as a citizen. Anyone who try’s to steal that right from you or tries to damage your right to a fair trial is violating your rights protected by our Constitution. A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>     Many of you may have tuned into the Johnny Depp V. Amber Heard trial that took place in Fairfax, VA. During this trial the court and the world heard from many witnesses and saw countless amounts of evidence. What stands out the most, in my opinion, is Ms. Heard committed perjury and misrepresented several of her exhibits (photos) while on the stand in this case. This petition will only be submitted to the local prosecutor, in Fairfax County Virginia, to investigate and or possibly file charges against Ms. Heard for perjury related to her testimony in the VA case only. This is not a petition to other jurisdictions; such as Los Angelas, California or the United Kingdom. This petition will be sent to the following; Office of the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney, Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano, and Chief Judge Penny Azcarate of the Fairfax County Circuit Court. <br><br></p>
<p>     It’s been recently discovered that Ambers legal fees are being covered by an insurance provider. This means Amber Heard has not spent any of her money on legal fees let alone $6 million she claims she spent while she was providing her testimony. Her lawyers even said this lie again during closing arguments. This was a clear lie as both Amber and hear attorneys were well aware Ms Heard had not spent her money covering legal expenses. This along with the below proof of perjury is overwhelming and Amber needs to be charged!!!!!! </p>
<p>     During this trial Ms. Heard took the stand and swore under oath the testimony she would give the court was truthful. In my opinion, Ms. Heard lied to the court, with the assistance of her attorney’s, and presented physical evidence that were either tampered and or altered. Ms. Heard and her legal team submitted several exhibits to the court to which Ms. Heard also testified to their foundation. I’ve identified four exhibits to support this petition for perjury charges. </p>
<p>     On May 16, 2022, during Ms. Heard’s direct examination, Attorney Elaine Bredehoft began showing Ms. Heard several photo exhibits which she as asked to identify and describe. Attorney Bredehoft asked for defendants exhibit 712 be shown to Ms. Heard while also moving this exhibit into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe what was being depicted. Ms. Heard stated it was an other picture of her face taken at the same time, as the prior exhibits related to the May 21, 2016 incident. Attorney Bredehoft, right after showing exhibit 712, asked for defendants 713 be shown to Ms. Heard as well as being entered into evidence. Attorney Bredehoft asked Ms. Heard to describe exhibit 713 to the jury. Ms. Heard stated exhibit 713 was taken at the same time and location as exhibit 712. Ms. Heard also stated in exhibit 713 her friend taking the photo, Ms. Raquel Pennington, turned on additional lights prior to it being taken. Ms. Heard’s own testimony described both exhibits 712 and 713 as being two different photos as they turned on additional lighting to take exhibit 713. This testimony along with the meda-date of the exhibits prove Ms. Heard committed perjury. A visual examination of exhibits 712 and 713 reveal they are in fact the same photo. These exhibits are so identical they bare the same file name (IMG_6087.JPG) and both were taken at the same date and time, down to the very second (May 21, 2016 9:25:12 PM). Only difference between both exhibits is one appears to have been visually altered to change its appearance. </p>
<p>     Based on the metadata of exhibits 712 and 713, it proves Ms. Heard’s testimony was a lie and physically impossible. Ms. Heard told the court after taking the photo in exhibit 712, her friend Ms. Pennington turned on additional lighting before taking the photo in exhibit 713. If they in fact did turn on additional lighting for this photo, the file name along with the time stamp of the photo would have changed, as it would have been a new image taken at a different time. It’s with Ms. Heard’s own evidence that her testimony is proven to have been a lie. Ms. Heard and Attorney Bredehoft entered these exhibits onto the record describing them as two different photos when they were in fact the same photos, with one being tampered with and or altered. Ms. Heard was later questioned about these exhibits. When asked if both exhibit 712 an 713 were the same photo, only difference being one was edited, Ms. Heard denied this repeatedly. </p>
<p><br>     It was further discovered during Ms. Heard’s cross examination, in her rebuttal case, an issues with defendants exhibits 512 and 725. Ms. Heard testified to the court, on May 16, 2022, that defendants exhibit 512 reflect damages created by Mr. Depp during the December 15th 2015 incident. This exhibit shows a whine bottle on floor with a spill stain, which the spill stain created a distinct pattern. However, during the same day of testimony, 5/16/22, Ms. Heard testified that defendants exhibit 725, showed the damage and spilled whine created by Mr. Depp during the May 21, 2016. A visual examination reveals exhibits 512 and 725 are photos of the same damage. As stated above the very distinct whine pattern on the floors in exhibit 512 is the same whine spill pattern in 725. Even with redactions on exhibit 725, you can notice the whine bottle is in the same position in exhibit 512. It would be impossible for exhibits 512 and 725 to reflect damage caused in different events, that would have taken place over 5 months apart of each other. An average person who possesses common sense can determine these two exhibits (512 and 725) are from the same incident taken on the same day. Ms. Heard testified under oath to the court they were two photos taken during two different events, these photos were also defendants exhibits which she had in her possession from the time they were taken. Meaning these were not surprise exhibits that could have confused Ms. Heard in the moment while giving testimony. </p>
<p>     These are only two examples, in my opinion, that Ms. Heard committed perjury, lying to the court, while testifying under oath in this court case. This petition demands a full detailed investigation be conducted into Ms. Heard’s whole testimony along with all exhibits submitted to the court. This investigation should include but not be limited to Ms. Heard’s direct and cross examination along with her rebuttal direct and cross examination. There is enough evidence to provide a willful intent to lie and or misrepresent evidence to the court based on the review of the testimony itself. However, once an investigation is conducted, investigators will have access to the exhibits, the metadata will not only prove but overwhelming support perjury charges against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>     Allowing Ms. Heard to get away with perjury in such a high profile public case, sends a dangerous message to the community. This could set a precedence making it okay to commit perjury and or willfully submit tampered with evidence to the court, as action won’t be taken due to the difficulty in which to get a conviction.

This type of misconduct will steal someone’s right to a fair and impartial trial, this applies to criminal and civil court proceedings. It’s been expressed that charging Ms. Heard with perjury would not be a simple task, there for charging her may never happen.

A person committing perjury is knowingly attempting to violate your rights. Which is why all offense related involving someone committing perjury shall be investigated. A celebrity status of a suspect, or the media attention that would come from charging them, shouldn’t and can’t be a legal determination not to charge. There is more than enough evidence to support a perjury investigation, let alone charges, into Ms. Heards testimony. </p>
