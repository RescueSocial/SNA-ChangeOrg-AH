security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.' In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a \"007 Flemming's novel\" to an artificial intelligence auditor? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups.

Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.<\/p>\n<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is where Amber won in the NGN trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.<\/p>\n<p>Audio clips, which were cut out of timed leaks, from Incredibly Incredible's channel - <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg<\/a> - are shown to provide context to Coercive Control. From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore. Right next door to this extreme wealth, are the slums of Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\"What happened on private jets and islands between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp?\" Was it really broadcasted, or was it silenced and twisted?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\"Hey @mariannaspring [BBC], after I discovered the connection between Johnny Depp attorney Adam Waldman &amp; a Vladimir Putin-connected Russian oligarch 16 months ago, I postulated the theory Depp's team was using bots to influence public opinion on his case.\" - <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegeekbuzz.com\/the-basement\/video-reveals-bots-signing-anti-amber-heard-petition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Geek Buzz<\/a>, July 28, 2020<\/p>\n<p>\"Twitter can be a hostile place,\u201d [Jennifer Robinson] says. \u201cThe online attacks in respect of Amber have been far worse than anything I experienced during the Julian Assange case.\u201d - Financial Times In Context: Jennifer Robinson, Assange's lawyer of 10 years, had to be hired by Amber Heard.

On Monday, a Virginia state court judge rejected the actor's bid for immunity over statements made about Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard. As a result, if the case moves to trial later this year, Depp will face counterclaims after his attorney told media outlets that Heard's tale of domestic abuse was a \"hoax.\"...<\/p>\n<p>Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was \"fake\" and all part of a \"sexual violence hoax,\" Heard included defamation counterclaims too...<\/p>\n<p>Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims \u2014 a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since\u00a0a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit\u00a0against a British tabloid. <strong>The November ruling that\u00a0Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was \"substantially true\"<\/strong> has\u00a0wounded Depp's career...<\/p>\n<p>The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.<\/p>\n<p>But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.)...<\/p>\n<p>\"In support of her accusation of malice, Ms. Heard alleged that the\u00a0GQ\u00a0journalist, Mr. Heath, stated that Mr. Depp invited him to interview the actor because he was 'angry \u2014angry about a lot of things \u2014and he's vengeful,'\" states the opinion. \"Moreover, Ms. Heard has alleged that Mr. Depp has the intention of ruining her career; citing statements that he made to friends demonstrating a malicious intent. Further, Mr. Depp has admitted his intent to destroy Ms. Heard's career by stating that he wanted her replaced on\u00a0Aquaman.\u00a0Accordingly, Ms. Heard has sufficiently pled a malicious intent, which prevents a ruling on the self-defense privilege at this stage in the litigation.\"<br><br>From: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/thr-esq\/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/thr-esq\/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The entire document of the case update is in PDF at the end of the article.

Just about every conversation alternated between her love for him and the problem of his abuse. These conversations took place well before she divorced Johnny and got a restraining order against him.7.The first time I saw the physical evidence of Johnny\u2019s abuse was before Amber was scheduled to appear on the Late Show with James Corden. Amber and I were supposed to go bowling the night before, but Amber told me that she could not join because she had been in a bad fight with Johnny. I came over to the Eastern Building to apply makeup before her TV appearance, and as I walked into her kitchen, I saw writing on the countertop in gold marker. Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of a picture that depicts the writing I saw that night. I also saw that a number of Amber\u2019s possessions had been smashed or destroyed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/refinery29.com\/en-us\/2016\/06\/113149\/domestic-violence-911-call-famous-friend\" rel=\"nofollow\">IO Tillet<\/a>:<\/strong> \u201cThe reports of violence started with a kick on a private plane, then it was shoves and the occasional punch, until finally, in December, she described an all-out assault and she woke up with her pillow covered in blood.

In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women\u2019s rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically). Amber has continued with trips to Central America where she met with human-rights defenders, diplomats, and indigenous community leaders.<\/p>\n<p><em>She has spoken for, introduced and advocated for democratic candidate Kamala Harris since 2007 and has been very active in supporting Harris in her 2020 presidential run<\/em>. Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as \u201crevenge porn\u201d) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.<\/p>\n<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and

security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.' In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a \"007 Flemming's novel\" to an artificial intelligence auditor? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. They terrified dozens of actresses.<\/em> Similarly, intense real-time monitoring occurs for Amber Heard online using AI Bots which claim using \"I am\" Persona Dialogue - open source between 2017 and 2020 - to be 'victims' and use ILM\/Alex fill in the blank based on previous text Dialogues which goes beyond a 2021 social network analysis paper using BERT: <a href=\"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/abstract\/document\/9385071\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/abstract\/document\/9385071<\/a> In irony, Elon Musk's OpenAI GPT-2 and GPT-3 - <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/harperreed\/gpt3-persona-bot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/github.com\/harperreed\/gpt3-persona-bot<\/a> - likely is being used against his ex girlfriend, Amber Heard.<\/p>\n<p>Witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed Depp's agents wanted to make lies about Amber Heard's trips to Tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.<\/p>\n<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore.

She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage.

In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women\u2019s rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically).

Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as \u201crevenge porn\u201d) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.<\/p>\n<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and

Time will tell the extent to which this new evidence, and Depp\u2019s impending slander suit will affect Amber Heard.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? Will Heard shrug this evidence off?

Unlike Atlantis, its placement is unstable, meaning the location of the city constantly changes, never to be found in the same place twice. Apparently. So, while the working title could just be a fun nod to lore, it could also mean Arthur may interact, or even fight, Mongo. It\u2019s safe to say that Black Manta will return as Aquaman\u2019s nemesis.<\/p>\n<p>Jason Momoa will return as the titular character, and despite fans\u2019 protestations, Amber Heard is still clutching the notion that she will once again be the queen of the deep. However, there\u2019s also been constant speculation that a\u00a0new major female character is being written into the script, as a means to both increase diversity among the ensemble and reduce Heard\u2019s screen time in the event of a worst case scenario. WB has yet to confirm that, but insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that\u00a0Aquaman 2\u00a0will have four female leads, though the tipster doesn\u2019t offer any further details to elaborate on his intel.<\/p>\n<p>Heard\u2019s Mera, the aforementioned mystery character and Nicole Kidman\u2019s returning Queen Atlanna will presumably make up 75% of the quartet, leaving one position unfilled. But with filming set to start a mere two months away, we should start to get some answers soon, both about the new mystery character and Heard\u2019s dubious chances of returning as the film\u2019s primary female lead.<\/p>\n<p>Aquaman 2\u00a0is currently set for a December 16, 2022 release.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.awn.com\/news\/aquaman-2-production-begin-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOURCE<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/wegotthiscovered.com\/movies\/aquaman-2-reportedly-4-female-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOURCE<\/a><\/p>","photo":"{'id': '225407387', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '\/\/assets.change.org\/photos\/1\/dd\/qt\/BAdDQTtNmJJOnQn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1617808591', 'processing': False}}","video":null,"embeddedMedia":null,"dmResponse":null,"status_manual":"against"},{"__typename":"StarterPetitionUpdate","id":28819119,"createdAt":1617477546000,"signatureCount":null,"petition__slug":"dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2","title":"Amber Heard on a Twitter rampage","description":"<p>Amber Heard is targeting fans as well as Johnny Depp\u2019s own lawyer on Twitter in a variety of ways \u2013 namely outright mocking them.

It seemed she had enough of Adam Waldman, and decided to respond to him and a variety of Johnny Depp fans on Twitter as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, Depp supporters have been targeted, having their comments reported en masse in an attempt to have them banned from Twitter.

There's evidence we haven't even seen yet. No matter how court goes, she loses in the court of public opinion, which will directly impact upon her career.

She stated, \u201cThroughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since then, Johnny Depp has fought back against every bad word against him with libel and defamation lawsuits, so far against\u00a0The Sun\u00a0(which he lost), and against Amber Heard, which has not yet been seen in court. According to\u00a0Deadline, the latest update is that their court date is once again pushed back to at least April 11, 2022.\u00a0If Amber Heard loses, she could face jail\u00a0time for tampering with evidence.<\/p>\n<p>Even though it\u2019s possible Johnny Depp could win his upcoming lawsuit in the coming years, there\u2019s no confirming whether or not Amber Heard will face jail time. Regardless, this puts Warner Bros. in a tough spot. Even though fans had petitioned for Warner Bros. to force\u00a0Amber Heard\u2019s resignation from\u00a0Aquaman 2, WB hasn\u2019t announced any plans for change.<\/p>\n<p>However, in December 2020, a lifestyle article in\u00a0Forbes\u00a0about Emilia Clarke\u2019s home let the cat out of the bag that Emilia Clarke had signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in\u00a0Aquaman 2.\u00a0Sadly, though, there\u2019s still no confirmation. It could just be wishful thinking on the fans\u2019 part.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not clear according to that article why Amber Heard could be facing jail time if Johnny Depp wins his appeal. They mention tampering with evidence, but don\u2019t say clearly what evidence, or how it was tampered with.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and suggest that if Johnny wins his appeal, Heard might be on the hook for some very serious perjury charges. She\u2019s already being investigated in Australia for Perjury charges for falsifying statements about smuggling their dogs Pistol and Boo into the country. So it wouldn\u2019t be a far stretch if she\u2019s investigated in a London court for the same crime. Not for lying about the dogs, this time, though, but for potentially lying on the stand during Johnny\u2019s libel case against NGN and the Sun tabloid.<\/p>\n<p>It could be for something else altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s not forget that there\u2019s no statute of limitations in Australia for grievous bodily injury requiring medical attention. And that\u2019s where Heard cut off the tip of Johnny\u2019s finger with a Vodka bottle. And, no. I\u2019m not making a wild accusation there. Heard herself was recorded on audiotape admitting that she did, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it!\u201d and begging Johnny not to leave her.<\/p>\n<p>The point being, if Johnny wanted to, he could always file a report with Australian police and have her put behind bars for a long time. And if her were the vengeful monster she keeps trying to say he is, he would have done that already.<\/p>\n<p>All Johnny\u2019s interested in is clearing his name. He\u2019s said it time and time again, and the fact that Heard\u2019s not cooling her heels already in an Australian prison proves it.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? Will Heard face jail time if Johnny wins his appeal? Or if he wins his defamation suit? Should Johnny press charges in Australia over his severed finger?<\/p>\n<p>Yeah. I do too.<\/p>","photo":"{'id': '225270885', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '\/\/assets.change.org\/photos\/1\/yp\/om\/ahyPoMgOnXIvGwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614623031', 'processing': False}}","video":null,"embeddedMedia":null,"dmResponse":null,"status_manual":"against"},{"__typename":"StarterPetitionUpdate","id":28619185,"createdAt":1614369420000,"signatureCount":null,"petition__slug":"dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2","title":"Amber Heard Physically unfit?","description":"<p>It\u2019s looking more and more like Amber Heard really won\u2019t be in Aquaman 2.<\/p>\n<p>This petition has reported long since that Heard\u2019s contract has been bought out by WB and that she won\u2019t appear in Aquaman 2.

There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>True to form, Heard manages to blame Johnny Depp for it, throwing Covid in for good measure. \u201cHeard allegedly blamed Johnny Depp and COVID-19 for her deteriorating health, saying that she\u2019s been under tremendous amount of stress and has been suffering from depression but she insists that she will get back in shape.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Filming for Aquaman 2 is set to start filming in June (2021), so it remains to be seen whether or not she\u2019ll get back in shape. We\u2019ll also have to wait and see if she is, or becomes, bondable for filming.<\/p>\n<p>That seems like a lot to happen in just a few months.<\/p>\n<p>Also, according to another industry insider, Heard may have failed to report an injury. If she were injured, failed to report it and got further injured during training, which is quite rigorous, the studio would have been on the hook for it. So, it's entirely possible that this is the nature of Heard being physically unfit.<\/p>\n<p>Whichever the reason it seems more likely than not that the rumors about Amber Heard not appearing in AM2 are true. I don\u2019t know whether it will Emelia Clarke or not that takes over, but I\u2019m totally on board with it if it is.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard fit back into the fish suit again or will we see somebody else taking over screen time in AM2?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.small-screen.co.uk\/amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-mera-dc-comics\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">source<\/a><\/p>","photo":"{'id': '225260964', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '\/\/assets.change.org\/photos\/4\/rk\/tm\/UwrKTMBCvDQOQLj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614369423', 'processing': False}}","video":null,"embeddedMedia":null,"dmResponse":null,"status_manual":"against"},{"__typename":"StarterPetitionUpdate","id":28613653,"createdAt":1614286902000,"signatureCount":null,"petition__slug":"dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2","title":"Johnny Depp pissed off?","description":"<p>The latest story coming from leaker Daniel Richtman is saying that <a href=\"https:\/\/wegotthiscovered.com\/movies\/johnny-depp-reportedly-furious-amber-heard-job-offers\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Depp is furious<\/a> that his ex-wife Amber Heard\u2019s star appears to be rising as his falls.

So even if he\u2019s eventually vindicated, he might never again be the A-lister he once was.<\/p>\n<p>Where to start.<\/p>\n<p>First, the sober truth is that Heard is a little long in the tooth to portray a Disney princess. Those girls are usually in their mid-teens, and Heard is twice that age now. It\u2019s highly unlikely that she\u2019s up for any such part.<\/p>\n<p>Second, after Heard has pestered Disney with subpoenas and legal shenanigans, it\u2019s not likely at all that they would line up to sign her for anything, let alone a role half her age.<\/p>\n<p>Third, Johnny is not hurting for work. If you look at Depp\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/pro.imdb.com\/name\/nm0000136?rf=cons_nm_meter&amp;ref_=cons_nm_meter\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDB pro<\/a> page, he\u2019s lined up to be involved with more than twenty projects.<\/p>\n<p>Heard has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm1720028\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2 projects<\/a> on her books. Aquaman 2, which she probably won\u2019t appear in. Strong rumor has it that Emilia Clark will replace Heard in Aquaman 2.<\/p>\n<p>The other project is \u201cRun away with me\u201d a project which was abandoned years ago. Two movies she will most likely not even appear in. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all she\u2019s got scheduled for future projects.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, but not least, it\u2019s looking more and more like Johnny Depp is going to be vindicated in both court proceedings, leaving him in a much more favorable position than Heard.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s not quite as bleak for Depp as Richtman would have you believe. Either his information is faulty or he\u2019s just plain wrong.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? Is Heard\u2019s star rising? Or is Depp coming out on top?<\/p>","photo":"{'id': '225257223', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '\/\/assets.change.org\/photos\/8\/pj\/sq\/bdpJsQhkPxDtqNI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614286904', 'processing': False}}","video":null,"embeddedMedia":null,"dmResponse":null,"status_manual":"against"},{"__typename":"StarterPetitionUpdate","id":28602060,"createdAt":1614126396000,"signatureCount":null,"petition__slug":"dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2","title":"Trial date pushed back","description":"<p>The defamation suit Johnny Depp took out against his ex wife Amber Heard was scheduled to on May 7th, 2021.

That cuts down on scheduling conflicts and keeps actors from negotiating for a better deal in-between each picture. But that\u2019s not always the case. Just as often, they take it one film at a time.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the Aquaman franchise, it looks like they opted to do one film at a time. If that is indeed the case, no actor is guaranteed a part in the second or third installment.<\/p>\n<p>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Amber Heard is already scrambling to try to secure her place in Aquaman 3, even though AM2 hasn\u2019t even begun to film yet.<\/p>\n<p>There are doubts about whether or not Heard will even appear in AM2. Almost 2 million people have made it clear that they don\u2019t want to see Amber Heard in any further AM films, and it\u2019s possible that WB is paying attention. One rumor has it that Heard\u2019s screen time in AM2 is being severely curtailed, with another female lead taking on more screen time.<\/p>\n<p>Other rumors whisper that Heard\u2019s contract has been bought out, meaning that while Heard got paid, she will not appear in the film at all.<\/p>\n<p>There are several factors that will likely determine whether Heard comes back in any subsequent Aquaman films. First, there are the court cases going back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. Depp is suing Heard for Defamation for portraying him as a domestic abuser who physically abused and terrorized her throughout their marriage. Depp is having none of that is on a legal crusade to clear his good name and prove that it was Heard who was the abuser the entire time. Heard has a lot of sob storied and the support of her friends to back up her abuse storied, while Depp has video and audio recordings of her admitting to abusing him. Unlike Heard, Depp also has medical evidence, including a fingertip that got severed and a burn on his cheek from a cigarette being put out on his face.<\/p>\n<p>The two are also embroiled in litigation in England from a libel case that Depp leveled against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, for calling Depp a wife-beater. Initially, the judgement favored the Sun, who repeated that wife-beater claim again. But Depp is appealing the verdict, and will likely prevail.<\/p>\n<p>If these two cases go Depp\u2019s way, it doesn\u2019t bode well for Heard\u2019s continued presence in the AM franchise. Most films have a morals clause in their contracts, and if Heard is proven to be a domestic abuser again, that clause might very well be invoked.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cagain\u201d because Heard was arrested in 2009 for domestic abuse against her then wife Tasya Van Ree.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the issue of whether or not Heard is bondable. That is to say, whether or not she can be insured for the duration of filming. If she can\u2019t be insured for any reason, like a preexisting medical condition, excessive drug or alcohol abuse, she can\u2019t and won\u2019t be hired for any future AM project.<\/p>\n<p>Heard supporters insist that she\u2019ll be in AM2 and 3 because there hasn\u2019t been any official announcement from WB about her being dropped. But that\u2019s not the way it works. If Heard has been dropped, there likely won\u2019t be any announcement. The movie will simply come out without her in it. So fans who want her dropped who are waiting for an announcement won\u2019t get one. We\u2019ll just have to wait for the film to come out to see whether she\u2019s in it or not.<\/p>\n<p>Time will have to tell whether or not Amber Heard is in Aquaman 2, let alone Aquaman 3. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how those court cases come out, and whether or not Heard is bondable.

Even creating and\/or signing this very petition. An investigation found less than a dozen questionable Twitter accounts that might be bots, blowing that claim out of the water.<\/p>\n<p>Undaunted, Heard has shoved forward, trying to obtain personal data about 200 Twitter users, to prove that they\u2019re bots and not real people, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Now, she\u2019s down to two. TWO people that she\u2019s upset at for: 1) saying they\u2019re proud of Johnny Depp for fighting to clear his name, and 2) refer to the defendant (Heard), a movie star, as \u201ca nobody.\u201d And she had to put that in there, that she\u2019s \u201ca movie star.\u201d She needed to point that out, I suppose, in case anybody forgets that she got lucky off the back of being married to Johnny Depp and scored Aquaman. Would she have gotten that movie on her own? Anybody? Bueller?<\/p>\n<p>She\u2019s throwing everything she can at the wall with regards to Twitter users, hoping that something will stick.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, all of the statements she\u2019s throwing around by Twitter fans are protected opinions of celebrities. People just don\u2019t like her, and there\u2019s not one single thing she can do about it.<\/p>\n<p>What I suspect, however, is that she doesn\u2019t really expect any of this Twitter bluster to stick to the wall. I think it\u2019s a diversionary tactic, intended to direct attention away from the avalanche of evidence Johnny Depp has that\u2019s bearing down on her.<\/p>\n<p>And it works. For a minute. But she\u2019s deluding only herself if she thinks that the people who support Johnny Depp are about to lose sight of the big picture. They might point fingers and laugh at her folly when she tries some new antic, but they\u2019re steadfast to the case at the heart of the matter.<\/p>\n<p>What will she pull next? What new filing will she throw at the court to try to filibuster her way out of the inevitable? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. One thing that\u2019s sure is that it\u2019ll bring out more finger pointing and giggles, at least until the final verdicts come down.

And it's important that they're of Russian origin, since great measures were taken to try to tie them to Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp's lawyer and friend.<\/p>\n<p>According to this article: \"The bot\u2019s Russian origin is a crucial aspect of this story.\u00a0Adam Waldman,\u00a0Johnny Depp\u2019s\u00a0attorney who was\u00a0barred from his upcoming libel case\u00a0in the United States, is a former lobbyist for Russian oligarch\u00a0Oleg Deripaska,\u00a0a Russian billionaire, and Kremlin insider. It\u2019s believed by some\u00a0he was involved with or has insider knowledge, of the 2016 hacking of the US election.\"<\/p>\n<p>Laying it on really thick in the anti-Waldman crusade.<\/p>\n<p>In recent history, two things have apparently bothered Amber Heard: Adam Waldman and this petition. She took care of Waldman by successfully lobbying to get him removed from Johnny Depp's upcoming Fairfax defamation case against Amber Heard. That backfired, though, since removing Waldman from the case left him free to discuss the case freely. And he has been. Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adam_waldman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Waldman's Twitter<\/a> feed to read some delightful insights into the case.<\/p>\n<p>And it's obvious that the petition bothers Heard, who mentions it prominently in her $100 million dollar countersuit.<\/p>\n<p>It's not the first time action has been taken to try and get the petition removed. Not long ago, negative comments were posted on the petition, and then reported as violations to try to get the petition taken down.<\/p>\n<p>That didn't work, and this isn't going to, either. I've already been in contact with Change.org, and rest assured. The petition is quite safe.<\/p>\n<p>Johnny Depp has a hearing on 18 March regarding his appeal in the UK libel case against the Sun, and the defamation suit in Fairfax is due to start in May - if it's not pushed back due to Covid.<\/p>\n<p>With these cases looming so large, it's possible that more shenanigans will pop up trying to further discredit Adam Waldman and attack the petition. Hopefully, both of these cases will reach fruition soon, and the matter can be decided, once and for all.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>How do you think these cases will play out? Will Johnny Depp get justice?

She\u2019s tying herself to Wood, including them together in her claims railing against men she seems to allege are getting away with abusing women, calling out the media, saying: \u201c...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan &amp; I aren\u2019t the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It seems that Heard went on a bender last night, posting about how the media seems to be ignoring Marilyn Manson after Wood\u2019s allegations.<\/p>\n<p>What it\u2019s got to do with her, one has to wonder. There are some Johnny Depp fans that really don\u2019t want to see Johnny dragged through the mud in the Manson case, but it seems that Heard is desperate to make sure that he is, by association.<\/p>\n<p>In her meltdown, at one point, Heard goes off on somebody that calls her a fraud, telling them to shut up if they haven\u2019t been in a situation where they were being strangled and fighting for their life. And, true to fashion, she did it using the tweenspeak trend of using numbers to abbreviate words, making it that much harder to take her accusations and vitriol seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Is she now saying that she herself has been strangled? Are these new allegations she\u2019s coming up with against Johnny Depp, or did she at one point say that he was strangling her while he was brutalizing her. Is that part of the testimony she gave behind closed doors? Or was that \u201cjust\u201d about being brutally raped? Is there anything she won\u2019t come up with to throw at Johnny Depp to try and make her case stick?<\/p>\n<p>In another post, she continues her rage against rich white men, which some might say is rather ironic since those have been the type of men she\u2019s spent her intimate time with. Or, perhaps she\u2019s just talking about the ones that have rejected her.<\/p>\n<p>If you recall, Heard\u2019s former assistant Kate James revealed that Heard stole her story of being raped.

I'm pretty sure she meant minions, but fell flat with the intended slight. One fan responded that Mignon actually means cute or pretty, \"...so, thanks.\"<\/p>\n<p>It seems that Heard is desperate at this point, especially with Depp\u2019s appeal in the UK case looming so near in the future. We all thought we\u2019d have to wait up to two years to hear anything else about that, but here it is, with a huge milestone in the case happening just next month.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, she seems desperate.

She spoke before panels and worked hard to try to reform domestic abuse laws.<\/p>\n<p>Today, she came forward with the name of her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/entertainment\/celebrities\/2021\/02\/01\/marilyn-manson-accused-horrifically-abusing-evan-rachel-wood\/4335539001\/#:~:text=Manson%2C%20in%20a%202009%20Q%26A,told%20the%20outlet%20of%20Wood.\" rel=\"nofollow\">alleged abuser: Marilyn Manson<\/a>. The two got together when Wood was in her teens and MM was in his thirties.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of people who immediately believe Wood because of her history of talking about this alleged abuse, and because Manson is just so weird. Also because he wrote in his autobiography that he used to be an abusive piece of shit and that he used to imagine crushing her skull with a sledgehammer. And for saying that the song \u201cI Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies\u201d was inspired by one of their breakups.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, four other women have stepped forward with similar accusations of their own against MM.<\/p>\n<p>All of that, along with Wood\u2019s disturbing allegations have a lot of people willing to crucify MM on the nearest telephone pole.<\/p>\n<p>What does that have to do with Amber Heard or Aquaman 2? At first glance, nothing. But if we take a closer look, the associations abound.<\/p>\n<p>First, ERW is \u201cclose\u201d friends with Heard. Wood has come out in <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/entertainment\/english\/hollywood\/news\/Evan-Rachel-Wood-defends-Amber-Heard-amid-her-feud-with-Johnny-Depp\/articleshow\/53280392.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\">support of Heard<\/a>\u2019s allegations against Johnny Depp since Heard first started to allege them \u2013 which is just about the time that Wood started talking about being a victim of domestic abuse. Coincidence number one.<\/p>\n<p>Also, it\u2019s a pretty well-known fact that MM is (or was) best of buddies with Johnny Depp. The two of them haven\u2019t been seen together in about a year, but they have a long history of being besties. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case isn\u2019t really known.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a fact that as far as I know, none of the women accusing MM ever called the police or filed any reports. The only word we have is in the media and on social media. I\u2019m not saying that makes them liars, far from it. A lot of victims never report their abuse. Johnny Depp didn\u2019t call the police. He relied upon his own private security to protect him.<\/p>\n<p>All I\u2019m saying is that the allegations against MM are pretty severe, with women saying they\u2019ve been violently raped, had their lives threatened, were locked in closets, were beaten, even whipped, and more. With allegations so severe, it\u2019s easy to wonder why the police weren\u2019t called, at least by one of them. It would certainly make the allegations easier to swallow.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also not saying MM didn\u2019t do it. His own words in his autobiography don\u2019t bode well for him, certainly.<\/p>\n<p>What I\u2019m saying is that we need to wait and see some proof, one way or the other. Until that happens, all we have is a she-say\/he-say situation.<\/p>\n<p>It could come down in a number of ways. MM could be the heartless, sadistic monster his self-proclaimed victims say he is, and he should be locked up for life.<\/p>\n<p>Or it could come down that the girls are in cahoots. Wood and Heard, I mean. The two of them, friends, have been alleging abuse against MM and Johnny Depp for roughly the same amount of time, and now would be a great time to come forward with MM\u2019s name, what with the legalities between Heard and Johnny Depp shaping up the way they are. It\u2019s not looking too good for Heard in the Fairfax, VA defamation case Johnny has leveled against her. So what better time to cut the legs out from under Johnny\u2019s bff with allegations of even more monstrous abuse?<\/p>\n<p>Or the two cases could have nothing whatsoever to do with each other but coincidence.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, it\u2019s too soon to call.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that is a fact is that Amber Heard has made it more difficult for victims of either gender to come forward with their stories of abuse thanks to her lies about being abused. Her sh*tstorm of mainstream media stories and crusade through the #MeToo movement have made it nigh impossible for anybody to come forward without enduring intense scrutiny. Gone are the days when we could #BelieveAllWomen. Heard\u2019s completely ruined that.<\/p>\n<p>So yeah. While there is a faction ready to believe her outright, ERW is being looked at with some skepticism by a large contingency.<\/p>\n<p>The only real truth here is that time will have to tell the truth of what\u2019s going on. My suggestion is to neither believe nor deny these allegations against MM until there\u2019s some shred of proof to back them up, or to prove that they\u2019re false.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what happened with Johnny Depp. He was accused of domestic abuse and a lot of people believed it. Then proof came out that those allegations were false.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying we should do here. Wait for some proof. Reserve judgement until we know definitively, one way or the other. The truth always outs, and it will in this case, too.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? Hang the dude\u2019s reputation on her word? Or wait and see?<\/p>","photo":"{'id': '225158142', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '\/\/assets.change.org\/photos\/9\/rl\/ds\/fMrlDSKhJQkHUzj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612224157', 'processing': False}}","video":null,"embeddedMedia":null,"dmResponse":null,"status_manual":"against"},{"__typename":"StarterPetitionUpdate","id":28461870,"createdAt":1612123402000,"signatureCount":null,"petition__slug":"dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2","title":"What is Amber Heard worth?","description":"<p>There's <a href=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Es_GRo6XIAAOXJ_?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">THIS<\/a> snippet from some magazine suggesting that Heard was paid $7 million dollars for her part as Mera in Aquaman 2.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we?<\/p>\n<p>Jason Momoa's total net worth is reported to be $14 million, and that's combined with his wife, former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet's net worth.

See Countercl. Paragraph 6. Nothing in that allegation implies facts showing that the change.org petitions included obscene language, threatened illegal or immoral acts, or suggest or propose obscene acts. See Va.

See VA code 18.2-152.7:1. The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts.
