The Stand - Evidence","<p><strong>Despite facing <a href=""https://youtu.be/w57Tf3JS7u4"" rel=""nofollow"">bots swarm tech, such as under a video on The Stand</a>, <em>Congrats to Amber Heard being Woman of the Year 2020</em> from <a href=""https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/women-of-the-year-2020-jp770mptk"" rel=""nofollow"">The Times</a>, <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/13412274/all-hail-our-women-year-2020-true-inspiration/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sun</a>, and of becoming a speaker at <a href=""https://www.harrywalker.com/speakers/amber-heard/"" rel=""nofollow"">Harry Walker</a>! We hope the world online becomes more <em>equal</em> for women!</strong></p>
<p><em>The Times</em>: ""She has become a vocal campaigner on the issue of domestic and sexual abuse as an ambassador for <em><strong>womenâs rights</strong></em> for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).""</p>
<p><em>The Sun</em>: ""On November 2, following a four-week trial, a judge ruled that the allegations against Depp, 57, were<strong> âsubstantially trueâ and that he was violent towards Amber.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Domestic violence charities have hailed the outcome a victory</strong></em> that will hopefully encourage other victims to speak out and seek justice.</p>
<p>Karen Ingala Smith, CEO of domestic violence charity Nia, praised Amberâs courage, saying: <strong>âI would like to acknowledge the bravery of Heard in naming the abuse that she was subjected to.â</strong>""</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hollywood Reporter, further, showed that Amber's ex, Depp, sent an abusive voicemail to his first wife, Lori, requiring a $1.25 million settlement in ""<a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion"" rel=""nofollow"">He's Radioactive</a>.""</li>
</ul>
<p>""Sources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny, with Richard Green serving as the stand-in for Johnny Depp.""</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, <strong>the online warfare to demean progress for women worldwide</strong> - people of my team know that female leaders in South America were removed because of online cyberabuse - continues.</em></p>
<p>Amber Heard may be in entertainment, but she's historically been highly political, highly an activist, and a humanitarian.</p>
<p>Contrary to former belief, the social technology companies are not liberal on the backend. Stereotypes abound against women and internationals in their training and actions, which is backed up by repeated people defying their NDA contracts. Pinterest's ex-COO recently won $22 million in a settlement about gender discrimination. The world is catching onto *environments* and *livability* online, as well as training, but meanwhile, we have to see people like Amber Heard struggle.</p>
<p>From real tests and studies, people will sign petitions, ""join in,"" and more <strong><em>even when they see bots signing</em></strong>. These leaders in tech do not go out and tell them that they're wrong. It's completely enabled, just like as part of the institutions Amber discussed in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Though Change.org shut down at least 4 abusive comment sections on petitions against Amber, deleted possibly two hate petitions, and the number of 253 in search related to her name has decreased to 241, <em>they still never put reCAPTCHA onto the large hate petition against her</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you can tell from the ratio of low amounts of comments, likes, and so on compared to 'signatures' that the petitions are usually increased to a set amount to gain attention via machine learning bot experts.</p>
<p>See this short video about the Bots Swarm the days just before Xmas! Happy 'holidays' or should I say, why should coders from reddit hate groups have more of a say than our own leaders?</p>
<p>By the way, it's online retaliation... Let's say maybe the internet differed during #MeToo. If it was different, though studies are as old as 2007, it's now fully controlled by 'men's rights' and other extremist groups. Anyone can hire them, but women in machine learning and AI is rare. In fact, it can just be 17% women in AI according to <a href=""https://action.consumerreports.org/coded_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">Coded Bias</a> documentary.Â </p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know that it's reported that Women's Shelters in Turkey are No Longer Safe because of (likely mostly online) retaliatory abuse against a Woman, Deniz Bulutsuz, who reported her Male Partner, a charismatic Actor, for violence? Just switch the names with Amber Heard and Depp.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>In reality, anyone who rationalizes abuse against Amber Heard is statistically and scientifically wrong in thinking that they're not harming women's safety and progress by doing so. It's proven in *real life* such as the danger increasing in Turkey due to the rationalized domestic abuse against women that it harms equality.</li>
</ul>

<p>""10. As part of his ongoing smear campaign, Mr. Depp and/or his agents acting on his behalf have directed both authentic and inauthentic social media accounts, and/or non-human controlled âbots,â to target Ms. Heard. ..

<p>16. Mr. Depp, through his agents and attorneys in Virginia, including specifically Waldman, have engaged in a campaign to harass and damages Ms. Heard through the use of computers and computer accessible vehicles. This conduct also has the potential effect of polluting the jury pool ....</p>
<p>37. In December 2018, Ms. Heard published an op-ed in the Washington Post calling for âchanges to laws and rules and social normsâ</p>
<p>It perpetuates abuse towards women and other victims online who have gone into the crossfires.""</p>

There isnât any new news about Johnny Deppâs appeal in the high court of London regarding his libel suit against the Sun tabloid for calling him a Wife-Beater.</p>
<p>And there isnât much new thatâs going on in Fairfax county. A few new subpoenas or motions get posted now and again, laying all the groundwork. But nothing too earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Johnny seems to be upbeat, carrying on with the task of being fabulous Johnny Depp. There are whispers of upcoming projects that might include the Addams Family and maybe even Beetlejuice.</p>
<p>Amber Heard has been keeping up the appearance of being an active actress and relevant activist, putting her speaking services on the market. For a mere 30 grand a pop, you can hire Heard to give a motivational speech about surviving hardship, civil liberties, or some such.</p>
<p>Neither one of them seems to be addressing the upcoming defamation court case. Maybe thereâs nothing new to talk about, or maybe theyâre both playing the long game.</p>
<p>Me, I think itâs the calm before the storm. We still havenât seen the majority of the footage from the Eastern Columbia buildingâs surveillance system, and weâre waiting with bated breath for the Toronto tapes. When those hit the public purview, nothingâs going to be the same.</p>
<p>Why didnât we see this evidence in the Sun trial? Because the Sun had nothing to do with the Eastern Columbia building. The Sun had nothing to do with Toronto.</p>
<p>Too many people lost sight of the fact that the Sun trial wasnât between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. It was against Johnny Depp and The Sun. Amber Heard was only a witness.</p>
<p>The Fairfax, VA trial is between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. As such, ALL the evidence comes into play. And I sincerely doubt that weâve even scratched the surface with all the evidence weâve seen so far. If I were on Johnny Deppâs legal team, Iâd save the best for last, pulling out the aces when the timeâs right. When itâs so damning that Amber Heard will have absolutely no defense. When it will well and truly screw her, finally revealing her for who and what she is, what she did, and holding her accountable for it.</p>
<p>We want to see the worst of it so that we can commiserate with Johnny and support him. But we also want him to prevail. We want him to win so that he can clear his good name, once and for all.</p>
<p>Wait for it, folks. Things might be quiet now, but Iâm betting that the very best is yet to come.</p>","{'id': '225027246', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/cj/hy/cqCJhyftbHttrMb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609436145', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>âThis year has been so hard for so many. Hereâs to a better time ahead. Happy Holidays, everyone! My love and respect to you all. Eternally, JD. Xâ He posted it with a picture of himself looking happy and well with Shane MacGowan on the set of the documentaryÂ Crock of Gold,Â which Depp produced.</p>
<p>That post has received over Â 1,965,562 likes.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the same token, Amber Heard was interviewed by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uretrfMA-Io"" rel=""nofollow"">Access Hollywood</a> in a new video on YouTube talking about how sheâs adapted and survived 2,000, including her legal troubles with Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>That video has received over 283,000 DISlikes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the comments on that video are heavily laden with sentiments supporting Johnny Depp, identifying with him as the victim of Amber Heardâs abuse. âThey wonât believe you, because you are a manâ many commenters post, due to an audio in which Amber Heard taunted Johnny saying that people wouldnât believe that he was in fact an abuse victim. They call Amber out for portraying herself as the victim when the opposite is in fact true, by her own admission. âI was hitting you,â She confessed to Johnny on tape. And the public wonât let her forget it.</p>
<p>Considering the number of likes Johnny Gets compared to the number of dislikes and negative comments Heard gets, I think itâs pretty clear how the public feels about the two of them.Â </p>","{'id': '225018363', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/5/wo/hd/UnwOHdPdbybJVaq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609185161', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28266946,2020-12-24 19:56:57+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny Depp requests retrial,"<p>Johnny Depp has asked the Court of Appeal to order a retrial of his libel claim against The Sun over an article calling him a âwife beaterâ, which a High Court judge found was âsubstantially trueâ. Justice Nicol, the judge in the case, basically believed Amber Heardâs claims that she was abused, and found that the Sun, therefore, had every right to call Depp a âwife beaterâ on their front page.</p>
<p>Since this ruling, many tabloids, which I will not link to here, have run rampant, calling Depp a wife-beater and just about everything else in the book.</p>
<p>Johnnyâs request for a retrial claims that he âdid not receive a fair trialâ and the judgeâs ruling is âplainly wrongâ and âmanifestly unsafeâ, according to documents filed by Mr. Deppâs legal team with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>Says David Sherborne, counsel for Johnny Depp: âThe judge failed to properly assess [Heardâs] credibility by reference to documentary evidence, photographs, recordings or otherwise.â He further claimed that audio recordings of Mr Depp and Ms Heard while they were in a relationship demonstrated that âMs Heard had not only been the violent one â¦ but that she had also been untruthful in her oral evidence about the appellantâs violenceâ.</p>
<p>You can view the documents Johnnyâs legal team filed on <a href=""https://www.nickwallis.com/courtofappeal"" rel=""nofollow"">Nickwallis.com</a>.</p>
<p>NGN will have to file a response and then a decision will be taken by a Court of Appeal judge on whether or not to allow the application (this can be done with or without a hearing). A decision could come down as early as January. If Deppâs request for a retrial is dismissed, itâs all over and Nicolâs judgment stands.</p>
<p>At that point, Johnnyâs only recourse against his ex-wife (Heard) will be his upcoming defamation suit against her resulting from her op-ed in the Washington Post, in which she describes herself as a survivor of his domestic abuse. She doesnât name him specifically in that piece, but sheâs been naming him ever since their split in every other outlet, so her message was clear and obvious.</p>
<p>Hereâs hoping the new year brings Johnny the vindication he deserves.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28262754,2020-12-23 16:14:24+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard AM2 role shrinking,"<p>Up until now, most of the fallout from Johnny Deppâs legal woes with ex-wife Amber Heard has been at Johnny Deppâs expense. Now, a lot of folks on the internet are campaigning to see Heard suffer the same treatment. In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 is nearing a staggering 2 million signatures. And while WB has yet to announce any plans to hire another actress for the role, it seems that theyâre trying to come up with a compromise.</p>
<p>With all of this going on, it looks like WB is gearing up to either reduce Amber Heardâs role in Aquaman 2 or write her out altogether.</p>
<p>According to Grace Randolph, the host of the âBeyond The Trailerâ YouTube channel, the studio is bringing on another female lead to âbalance things out.â</p>
<p>âSome of you are asking re Amber Heard â as I told you before, they are bringing on this new female lead to balance things out, and writing the script so that Heardâs role can be cut down if needed. But as of right now sheâs still in Aquaman 2,â the journalist wrote on her Twitter feed.Â </p>
<p>As we learned last month, Warner Bros. may not be able to fire theÂ London FieldsÂ star if it comes to it due to her contract. What they can do, however, is find a way to sideline her character in favor of a newcomer in Aquaman 2. To what extent theyâll do so, though, is anyoneâs guess at this point.</p>
<p>Another source has maintained that al of this speculation is pointless, as Amber Heard has already been removed from Aquaman 2. If those sources are to be believed, itâs true that Amber Heard canât be officially fired, but that sheâs been bought out of her contract. Pretty much the same situation as Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts. They fired Johnny, but paid his contract. Thatâs what itâs rumored happened to heard. They basically paid her not to be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2Â is due to start shooting in Australia after the new year ahead of its scheduled release in December 2022. Time will tell if Heard will be involved. Itâs entirely possible that the new female lead isnât just being brought on board to âbalance things out.â She might be Heardâs replacement.</p>
<p>Good.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28247422,2020-12-19 17:12:14+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,The latest,"<p>Two years to the day after Amber Heard published an editorial describing the backlash she faced as a domestic abuse survivor, a Virginia judge ordered the actress to produce her arrest recordÂ in the defamation case filed against her by ex-husband Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Her arrest record, which involves an altercation with a different romantic partner more than a decade ago, is âcrucial to key allegations in Mr. Deppâs complaint,â said the actorâs lawyer, Benjamin Chew of Brown Rudnick, during a hearing Friday in Fairfax County.Â </p>
<p>Thing is, though, that Iâm pretty sure there have been more arrests than Heardâs 2009 arrest for domestic violence against her wife Tasya Van Ree. As I understand it, there have been a couple of DUIâs and rumor has it that there was at least one other arrest for domestic violence. I donât know against whom, but it looks like weâre going to find out.</p>
<p>If this is true and Amber Has multiple arrests against her for domestic violence, it could be crucial in helping Johnny Depp establish that it was Heard who was violent in their relationship.</p>
<p>On the same day, a subpoena was issued to the ACLU, one of the organizations to which Heard swears she donated part of her 7 million dollar divorce settlement. It Â has long been rumored that Heard didnât donate to these organizations as she swore in her divorce documents, legal court documents, that she would.</p>
<p>I donât know exactly what could happen to Heard if she kept the money and didnât donate it, or didnât donate all of it, like she said she would. Contempt of court, maybe? Or would this even be grounds for the divorce to be revisited? Could she owe that money back to Johnny? Weâll have to wait and see what the fallout is, but the fact is that she will now have to prove in a court of law what she did with that money.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it goes to her credibility if she swore to donate that money and didnât. Not that her credibility holds much weight anymore.</p>
<p>Three days later, the court issued a subpoena for iO Tillet Wright, longtime friend and flying monkey of Heardâs. <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/high-profile/depp%20v%20heard/cl-2019-2911-foreign-subp-prep-io-tillet-wright-12-18-2020.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The service notice</a> doesnât say whether it was Heardâs side or Johnnyâs that requested the subpoena. It would be interesting to see who called iO. Itâll be even more interesting to see how far iO is willing to go to perjure himself for Heard. Itâs one thing to lie to a court abroad where they canât touch you. Itâs another thing to perjure oneself in America where they can easily find you and level perjury charges. Itâll be interesting to see how far any of her friends are willing to perjure themselves.</p>
<p>It bears note that some of those previously pro-Heard folks are deleting their social media en masse. I donât know if itâs related to the defamation case thatâs looming ever larger, but itâs certainly possible.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it looks like Amber Heardâs legal world is crashing down on her. I wonder what her response will be when Johnny wins his defamation case, and then wins his appeal in the libel case he leveled against the Sun tabloid and subsequently lost. I wonder what the whole worldâs reaction will be. So many have been so quick to vilify him. I wonder how quick theyâll be to vindicate him.</p>
<p>Time alone will tell.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28238185,2020-12-17 17:45:23+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,You can now hire Amber Heard to speak,"<p>Amber gets on board with Prince Harry &amp; Megan Markleâs public speaking agency. The public speaking agency is based out of New York, called The Harry Walker agency.</p>
<p>The agency has even made a statement regarding Amberâs entry into the agency. On their official website, Amber Heard is described her as âAn outspoken advocate for womenâs rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence around the world, Amber works with organizations that encourage survivors both personally and politically to come forward and reclaim their power. Amber makes frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence.â<br><br>If youâd like to hire her to speak at your event, she can be booked for the princely sum of $33,000. The agency describes her talks as âdeeply movingâ and says that hiring her is an excellent choice for a group or organization thatâs looking for âsome much-needed inspiration from a woman who walks day-to-day looking to be a contribution.â</p>
<p>There are, of course, those who would vehemently disagree. A large contingency of the public view Heard as a woman who abused her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as she admitted as much on audiotape. Those people find it ludicrous that Heard should dare to claim to be a spokesperson for survivors when she herself is an admitted abuser with a history of being arrested for domestic abuse against wife Tasya Van Ree in 2009.</p>
<p>Heard has already spoken at the Global Citizen Festival, the Social Good Summit and the LâOreal Women of Worth awards, leading the reader to believe that Heard was paid to speak at those events. So, with a payday of up to $33,000 per appearance, her outpouring of heartfelt civic duty doesnât exactly come across as altogether altruistic, does it? Rather, she seems motivated by the payday, which some would argue has always been her only impetus.</p>
<p>I for one will be interested to see how many people or organizations will hire Heard to speak for such a hefty payday. As more and more evidence comes out about the sort of person she really is, I can only imagine that this prospect will fail for her, just like all the rest of them do.</p>

Iâm one of them. Anything that has Amber Heard in it gets a hard pass from me, and I can think of about 1.7 million people who feel the same way.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest showing our support for Johnny Depp by watching something by Johnny Depp instead, whether itâs a DVD you already own, or picking a Johnny Depp movie on the streaming platform of your choice. There are lots of excellent movies to choose from, so it shouldn't be too hard finding a good one. Me, I'll probably be watching Pirates.</p>
<p>I like Stephen Kingâs work as much as the next guy, and I know that he didnât personally hire Amber Heard, but I simply cannot support a project that sheâs in. Nothing personal Steve. I just can't.</p>
<p>So if you feel the same way, letâs let the industry know that weâre having none of her by boycotting âThe Standâ and stream something by Johnny Depp instead. Let 'em know what we want: Johnny Depp. And what we don't want: Amber Heard.Â </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28195245,2020-12-09 23:53:53+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny dropped the N bomb to Ex Lori Anne Allison?,"<p>âSources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny.â</p>
<p>Thatâs just one of the many allegations put forth in an article published by The Hollywood Reporter. There are a ton of others, but I wonât dignify them by repeating them here. Iâll post the link because I have to cite my sources, but Iâm hoping that you wonât give them any hits by clicking through to read it. Itâs just all the same lies Amber Heardâs been spouting over the last few years.</p>
<p>I selected this statement to write about because this is the first time Iâve ever seen it. And because itâs so full of outrageous and flawed elements that I just had to pick it apart.</p>
<p>First, âSourcesâ? Really? Until or unless these âsourcesâ are identified, itâs pretty hard to take anything that follows seriously.</p>
<p>Second, it doesnât say WHEN this alleged payment took place. Johnny married Lori Anne more than 30 years ago. Thatâs a long stretch of road during which this alleged transaction could have taken place. Theyâre going to have to narrow it down a little more before it can be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Third, they also donât say WHEN this long, ranting message took place. Was it back when they were together? Sometime since? Did he recently call Lori Anne out of the blue just to leave audio evidence of racial epithets nobody else on the planet has ever accused him of using? Just like I said a minute ago, they need to narrow down the timeline.</p>
<p>Fourth, when else has Johnny ever been accused of using language like that? Every? So weâre supposed to believe that he did it on tape just because some unnamed âsourcesâ say so? Are we really supposed to be that gullible?</p>
<p>Fifth, whereâs this message? If âsourcesâ have heard it, why havenât we? Are we supposed to believe that a tape like this exists and it hasnât been leaked to the public?</p>
<p>Sixth, why in the world would Johnny Depp need to use a fake name to give his ex-wife some money? If Johnny wanted to give his ex some money, for whatever reason, thereâs no reason whatsoever that he couldnât just do so. He gave Vanessa money, too, and thereâs nothing shady about it. By all accounts, heâs a generous guy. Why shouldnât he be able to give his ex some money if he wants to?</p>
<p>Iâm sorry, folks, but it doesnât quite wash. They talk about scrutiny, but the fact is that there are far too few details for a claim like this to stand up to even the most casual scrutiny.</p>
<p>The point here, is that headlines like this are juicy and look damning on the surface, but you need to look a little deeper to determine if thereâs any substance to back them up. This is just one among many allegations being tossed about in the press since the court in the UK ruled against him in his libel case against the Sun. The mediaâs been having a field day at Johnnyâs expense, and thereâs no more substance to those headlines than there are to this one. Itâs just a bunch of fluffed-up rubbish set forth with no more justification than that someone said so.</p>
<p>Donât take the headlines seriously, boys and girls, no matter how good â or bad â they look. Thereâs a good chance that itâs just a bunch of unfounded allegations being printed to sell papers. Or to get clicks online. Thatâs all. They, the papers, donât care about the truth. If they did, theyâd be exposing Johnny Deppâs abuser, proven by her own words, rather than serving the victim up on a platter the way they are. So donât give them the satisfaction of giving their trash a second glance. Stick to the world of facts which have been proven, tried and true, by the abuser herself.</p>
<p>The truth will out in the end. Itâs no coincidence that this article came out at the same time as Johnny applied to the higher court to move forward with his appeal to overturn the verdict in the Sun case. Like I said before, itâs all an agenda thatâs being spoon fed to you. Donât swallow it.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28173276,2020-12-05 17:52:18+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Steven Crowley and Amber Heard,"<p>Steven Crowley is an actor that knew and worked with Amber Heard on a movie called âNever Back Down.â He recently posted on <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@stevencrowley/video/6899955612692516101?_d=secCgsIARCbDRgBIAMoARI%2BCjwJwKV1Z7iPseiCnqcCqgorvxQKfKudCC6U7odEm%2BcVhDyZL7DW5DPEBlgxJ6RT3XEjlQvarTehNaYz1yEaAA%3D%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAASEfHqDmQjy3OT_mgTD_dVC8Q2fpeea5FYcGo9DQOmhwG6MdY7e95hhOPSQMv1VQ8&amp;share_item_id=6899955612692516101&amp;share_link_id=702327CC-07B7-4399-BF29-AEB9E9D6537B&amp;timestamp=1606655972&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=d26ea8e5m5j667&amp;user_id=6602617470308057093&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m"" rel=""nofollow"">Tik Tok</a> that he has his own stories about Amber Heard and promised to do a YouTube about them. He posted a picture of himself and Amber Heard with the caption âMe trying not to get beat up every day on set for 3 months.â</p>
<p>Well, on December 2nd, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">that video</a> went up on YouTube. Steven and his buddy Jason were chatting away, and then, about 12 minutes in, Steven starts talking about Amber Heard. He described first meeting her as sex personified, and so charming and overpowering that if sheâd told him to go out and kill somebody, he would have done it. Not really, of course, but he was illustrating how much influence she can have on people, even at first sight. At least back then.</p>
<p>He went on to talk about Amber and the fights that she used to get into with her wife Tasya Van Ree, saying that they were real blow up fights. He also hinted at Amberâs drug and alcohol consumption as activities that he saw with his own two eyes.</p>
<p>Steven also talked about how Amber Heard was when she worked with Johnny Depp on the Rum Diary. Heard wasnât even remotely interested in Depp. She was married to Tasya, but was well aware of Johnnyâs interest in her, he said. It wasnât until after another couple of movies failed, a tv show failed, then all of a sudden you hear about Amber Heard being with Johnny Depp, and wouldnât you know it, she started getting parts.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was with Johnny Depp to further her career. Thatâs what Steven said without saying it.</p>
<p>Steven beat around the bush about a LOT of stories he said he could tell, but he was scared to death of getting sued if he told them. Jason assured Steven that the truth is the ultimate defense against a law suit, and that maybe these stories need to be told so that the world has both sides of the situation, not just the one that Heard is telling the world. Still, Steven hesitated and ultimately refused to say any more. The two agreed to talk about this more off-screen and then come back and revisit the issue in a future video.</p>
<p>What strikes me the most about the whole thing is how scared Steven was to talk about events he saw with his own two eyes. And, he said, there are a lot more people with stories to tell that are afraid to talk, too.</p>
<p>Why? Why are these people afraid of her? Because sheâll sue them? Like Jason said, the truth is the best defense against that. And itâs not just a matter of he say/She say if multiple people are stepping forward to corroborate each otherâs stories. And Iâm sure there are some people with photos or videos to back their stories up. They just have to work up the nerve to step forward and speak up.</p>
<p>All it takes is for one person to say âenoughâ and stand up. Once that first brave soul makes a stand and speaks out against Amber Heard, I think the floodgates will open up and everybody else whoâs been holding back stories will come forward too. And itâll be high time. This no-talent would-be actress has held her reign of terror long enough.</p>
<p>And I think that with the VA trial coming up, her web is going to start falling apart. Sheâs having to subpoena people who were previously willing to talk about her freely. I think theyâre starting to realize what theyâve got to lose, and that her ship is sinking. And it is. The USS Amber Heard is taking on water, more every day. Itâs only a matter of time until those rats start hopping off. I think weâre seeing it already.</p>
<p>By all means, go have a look at Steven Crowleyâs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a>. See for yourself all of the stories he hints at being able to tell about her, and witness how afraid he is to talk.</p>
<p>Letâs hope heâs the one that starts the ball rolling about Heard. Itâll make him a hero of epic proportions. He might just by a lynchpin if they get him involved with the VA case.</p>
<p>Come on, Steven. You can do it!</p>","{'id': '224939220', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/jo/ak/VPJOaKaUxbgUdKR-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607190740', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
