812009941,"Я подписываюсь потому, что считаю решение диснея не справедливым и глупым. Личная жизнь не должна никаким образом влиять на карьеру, мы точно не знаем что произошло и суд в точности нам тоже этого не скажет. Джони Депп был изначально в главной роли и эту роль он сыграл превосходно, далее роли без него принесут фильму убытки, так как большинство людей узнав что его в фильме нет, не станут покупать билеты. Я думаю дисней не должен был так поступать с человеком, с которым очень много работал. Потому что если с ним так поступили, то могут так поступить с остальными актёрами у которых произойдёт в семье что-то плохое. Это жизнь и в ней может произойти всё что угодно и за это актёров будут позорно увольнять. Тогда им лучше будет не сотрудничать с диснеем чтобы не попасть в такую ситуацию...

816927868,"""We do not want to use the term ‘harassment.’ What is happening today is sexual terrorism.Dealing with a sexual harassment case at work that security won’t take seriously. They messed with the wrong woman. I was quiet years ago, I won’t be this time. Sexual violence is a major issue affecting women around the world. It occurs within homes, on college campuses, in times of conflict, and in times of peace. Society has developed a certain attitude towards sexual assault. It has been embedded within culture that women are lesser than men and viewed as subordinate. Sexual violence has been normalized by media, desensitizing society to actual assault and hindering action against it. Women often bear the responsibility and blame of their assault rather than their attacker. This failure to protect victims of sexual assault and shifting of the blame to women for their own assault is termed rape culture; it is when the traumatic assault of a woman is trivialized, when men are given a pass and women are scolded for what they were wearing at the time of the attack, and when a woman would rather stay silent than seek the prosecution of her assailant. Sexual violence and the consequences of rape culture are violations of human rights in which the dignity and equality of women are not recognized. Rape culture is a human rights issue rooted in patriarchal societies, the normalization of sexual violence in media, and victim blaming.
Let me say that: The majority of men do not rape. But consider these other categories:
    Men who do not rape but would be willing to rape if they were sure they would not be punished.
    Men who do not rape but will not intervene when another man rapes.
    Men who do not rape but buy sex with women who have been, or likely will be, raped in the context of being prostituted.
    Men who do not rape but will watch films of women in situations that depict rape or rape-like acts.
    Men who do not rape but find the idea of rape sexually arousing.
    Men who do not rape but whose sexual arousal depends on feeling dominant and having power over a woman.
    Men who do not rape but routinely masturbate to pornography in which women are presented as objectified bodies whose primary, or only, function is to provide sexual pleasure for men.
Those men are not rapists. But is that fact — that the men in these categories are not, in legal terms, guilty of rape — comforting? Are we advancing the cause of ending men’s violence against women by focusing only on the acts legally defined as rape? Rape is rape, and rape culture is rape culture""

""Pornography is now beyond anyone’s control. It’s a classic example of ever-controversial unregulated capitalism — the market automatically responding to individual needs and desires. I continue to support and defend pornography, which I believe exposes the deepest, darkest truths about sexuality.""

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”

“The rape of a child is a violent act of contempt, not an expression of sexuality or affection.”

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.
The height of the harassment is that I am still bombarded with stupid calls from unknown foreign men and at my age and still on the net porn sites under my name are nasty deep fakes, such as the sadistic porn site Assholefever or an insulting suitor and whore forum, where women even more to be demoted than usual.
But there is also damage to property and human dung in the garden. The Koran says that women are the field of men, but as far as I know the Koran doesn't say that good male Muslims are entitled to shit in women's gardens.

The stalking and harassment on the net started right at the beginning of the rental period, when I was 48 years old and involved in organizations for women's and human rights and also an active member. Now I am 66 years old and the hate campaign of obviously many women-hating perpetrators who at least more than sympathize with the Islamic apartheid that women are completely worthless and are only suitable as sex objects is going on.
Sexualized, misogynistic and often very personal - online violence is increasing rapidly. The perpetrators usually go unmolested. It doesn't matter what you look like, it is enough that you open your mouth as a woman, as a young woman or as a woman in general. We expose these men and these haters by showing that we have brains. And that what they are trying to portray, their image of women, does not correspond at all to what we portray: the strong woman who is not allowed to exist in her world. And that's why we are an enemy. And that's why they go into the personal and try to hurt women with it.
The violence women experience online is mostly sexualized, clearly misogynistic and often very personal. Female Politicians receive hardcore porn with their heads mounted. Female Journalists are advertised on relevant websites as prostitutes on the Internet. Female Climate activists have to protect their private addresses because the rapists would like to drop by in real life. And of course there are also the dick pics: photos of penises that younger women in particular receive unsolicited direct messages on social media. This development leaves its mark - on women themselves, but not least in our society. Net violence is changing the way women move, behave and express themselves on the Internet. Many consider very carefully which topics they are still addressing on social media. You censor yourself to protect yourself. According to a European study, every second woman stays out of discussions on social networks after such experiences. Politicians are resigning from their offices or no longer running because they can no longer stand the online hatred. Women journalists are more often affected by depression and anxiety disorders due to hatred on the net, report less on certain topics or even consider getting out of journalism altogether. Much of what women have fought for in analogue life since the women's movement is being questioned again online - and often remains unchallenged or unpunished.

Because that is also part of the truth: Many women who defend themselves and go to the police to file a complaint are ridiculed. They are asked why they have to ""provoke so"" or why they not just delete their Facebook account when everything is so bad. Prosecutors are quick to drop proceedings because they do not recognize violence against women as such and do not punish it as hate crime. It takes consistent law enforcement. This can only happen if the authorities are aware that misogyny on the Internet is not a trivial matter and not a coincidence. This not only requires more women in the apparatus, but also training and a management culture that does not downplay or glorify violence against women. Legislation is needed that addresses violence against women. Because if perpetrators are not held accountable, hatred and violence against women in public become a bit more normal every day.

And we, who are part of this public, can help to draw red lines. By supporting women who are being attacked on the internet every day in front of all of us. In concrete terms, this means: solidarity in the comment columns, by direct message or by retweet. Anyone who receives support cannot be silenced so quickly. Knowing that you are not alone is still a great motivation for many politically active women online, not to give up and to oppose the hatred.

We must say it very clear: The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Caged Eyes: An Air Force Cadet's Story of Rape and Resilience /Lynn K. Hall (Autor)
Desperate to realize her childhood dream of being an astronaut, Lynn K. Hall was an enthusiastic young cadet. For Hall, the military offered an escape from her chaotic home—her erratic mother, absent biological father, and a man she called “dad” who sexually abused her. Resolute and committed to the Air Force Academy, Hall survived the ordeals of a first-year cadet: intense hazing from upperclassmen, grueling physical training, and demanding coursework. But she’s dismissed from the Academy when, after being raped by an upperclassman and contracting herpes, she is diagnosed with meningitis and left with chronic and debilitating pain.
Betrayed by the Academy and overcome with shame, Hall candidly recounts her loss of self, the dissociation from her body and the forfeiture of her individuality as a result of the military’s demands and her perpetrator’s abuse. Forced to leave the military and return to the civilian world, Hall turns to extreme sports to cope with and overcome PTSD and chronic pain. She, in turn, reclaims herself on the mountain trails of the Colorado Rockies.
An intimate account of grappling with shame and a misogynistic culture that condones rape and blames victims, Caged Eyes is also a transformative story of how it’s possible to help yourself and others in the aftermath of a profound injustice.

In the Name of Honor: A Memoir /Mukhtar Mai (Autor)
In June 2002, journalists throughout the world began to hear of the gang rape of a Pakistani woman from the impoverished village of Meerwala. The rape was ordered by a local clan known as the Mastoi and was arranged as punishment for indiscretions allegedly committed by the woman's brother. While certainly not the first account of a female body being negotiated for honor in a family, and (sadly) not the last, journalists and activists were captivated. This time the survivor had chosen to fight back, and in doing so, single-handedly changed the feminist movement in Pakistan. Her name was Mukhtar Mai, and her decision to stand up to her accusers was an act of bravery unheard of in one of the world's most adverse climates for women.
By July 2002, Mai's case was headline news in Pakistan and under international scrutiny, the government awarded her the equivalent of 8,500 U.S. dollars in compensation money (a historic settlement), and her attackers were sentenced to death. Mukhtar Mai went on to open a school for girls in an effort to ensure that future generations would not suffer, as she had, from illiteracy.
In this rousing account, Mai describes her experience and how she has since become an agent for change and a beacon of hope for oppressed women around the world. Timely and topical, In the Name of Honor is the remarkable and inspirational memoir of a woman who fought and triumphed against exceptional odds.

Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town /Jon Krakauer (Autor)
Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, home to a highly regarded state university whose beloved football team inspires a passionately loyal fan base. Between January 2008 and May 2012, hundreds of students reported sexual assaults to the local police. Few of the cases were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.
In these pages, acclaimed journalist Jon Krakauer investigates a spate of campus rapes that occurred in Missoula over a four-year period. Taking the town as a case study for a crime that is sadly prevalent throughout the nation, Krakauer documents the experiences of five victims: their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the skepticism directed at them by police, prosecutors, and the public; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them. These stories cut through abstract ideological debate about acquaintance rape to demonstrate that it does not happen because women are sending mixed signals or seeking attention. They are victims of a terrible crime, deserving of fairness from our justice system. Rigorously researched, rendered in incisive prose, Missoula stands as an essential call to action.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

The book provides detailed answers to a wide array of questions that bother scholars and charts a way forward.

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the partial or complete removal of the external female genitals for cultural rather than medical or religious reasons―its origin is unknown. Practitioners believe the procedure enhances the girl’s health, hygiene, chastity, fertility and marriage prospects―the truth is it obliterates sexual pleasure, causes severe health problems and is sometimes fatal. This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

Ijeoma: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughters /Richard Sacks (Author)
Ijeoma: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughters focuses on eighteen-year-old Ijeoma, who is forced to undergo the ruthless act of tribal cutting as a condition of marriage to an abusive man who threatens the same on his daughters. Ijeoma, inspired by true events, follows Ijeoma as she leaves her Nigerian village for New York, vowing that what was forced on her will not happen to her children.

Beautiful: A beautiful girl. An evil man. One inspiring true story of courage/Katie Piper (Author)
'I heard a horrible screaming sound, like an animal being slaughtered ... then I realised it was me.'
When Katie Piper was 24, her life was near perfect. Young and beautiful, she was well on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming a model.
But then she met Daniel Lynch on Facebook and her world quickly turned into a nightmare ...
After being held captive and brutally raped by her new boyfriend, Katie was subjected to a vicious acid attack. Within seconds, this bright and bubbly girl could feel her looks and the life she loved melting away.
Beautiful is the moving true story of how one young woman had her mind, body and spirit cruelly snatched from her and how she inspired millions with her fight to get them back.

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced/Nujood Ali (Author)
“I’m a simple village girl who has always obeyed the orders of my father and brothers. Since forever, I have learned to say yes to everything. Today I have decided to say no.”
Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.

817319510,"“But in any case, validity, offender self-reports have dubious validity, especially when the offender's self-interest is at stake. The only rule for deception in sex offenders I have ever found is this: If it is in the offender's best interests to lie, and if he can do it and not get caught, he will lie.
Being victimized as a child has become a ready excuse for perpetrating child molestation. The offender who claims he himself was victimized gets seen as less of a ""monster"" than one who wasn't a victim, and he gains much more empathy and support. It is hard to trust self-reports of sex offenders about abuse in their past when such reports are in their best interest.
Only a few studies on this topic have used objective measures, and they have found very different results.”

“over and over victims are blamed for their assaults. and when we imply that victims bring on their own fates - whether to make ourselves feel more efficacious or to make the world seem just - we prevent ourselves from taking the necessary precautions to protect ourselves. Why take precautions? We deny the trauma could easily have happened to us. And we also hurt the people already traumatized. Victims are often already full of self-doubt, and we make recovery harder by laying inspectors blame on them.”

It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

Fight gender apartheid! Against all extremism!
Violence does not arise in a vacuum, religious extremism must be fought before it breeds violence and terror. As with right-wing extremist assassins, the dehumanization of women is an elementary part of Islamist ideology. Gender apartheid begins where the separation of the sexes is demanded and enforced, and where women and girls are threatened if they want to exercise their freedoms.

Therefore every form of misogyny must be combated!
This includes not only counteracting the most widespread form of violence against women, domestic violence, and fully implementing the provisions of the Istanbul Convention, but also recognizing hatred of women as a dangerous underground for extremism and terrorism and resolutely opposing it .

Internally, action must be taken consistently against the curtailment of women's rights, especially to protect women and girls from Islamic communities, that is:

    The consistent persecution of female genital mutilation, child marriages and forced marriages, as well as the nationwide financial support of contact points and women's shelters for affected women and girls, because despite bans, girls and women are still threatened by these harmful practices.
    The criminal prosecution of those who force women to ""chaste"" behavior through the threat of violence, e.g. want to determine the love life, clothing and social contacts of female family members.
    The separate recording of so-called honor killings, in which the perpetrators indicate as a motive that the woman behaved ""unchaste"", too western ""and / or contrary to religious rules. These murders are also intended to prevent other women in the community from exercising their fundamental rights and thus constitute terrorism against the rights guaranteed in the Basic Law, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Istanbul Convention Women represent.

Protecting students from radicalization in schools:
Preventive work against all forms of radicalization must be expanded with ideologically neutral actors. As soon as teachers notice signs of radicalization, the schools must be provided with a package of concrete relief measures and trained staff. 
There must be a change in religious women hating.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic  and dangerous Islamist Australian ex-renter and his misogynist friends, all the biggest assholes on earth, believe me.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.
The height of the harassment is that I am still bombarded with stupid calls from unknown foreign men and at my age and still on the net porn sites under my name are nasty deep fakes, such as the sadistic porn site Assholefever or an insulting suitor and whore forum, where women even more to be demoted than usual.
But there is also damage to property and human dung in the garden. The Koran says that women are the field of men, but as far as I know the Koran doesn't say that good male Muslims are entitled to shit in women's gardens.
If I were not a polite lady, I would say that my ex-renter and his Islamist friends are a bunch of stinking, cowardly, disgusting manly shit that will one day disappear like a bunch of shit, because brave people, men and women, have to take care of that if you want to live in a peaceful world.


The stalking and harassment on the net started right at the beginning of the rental period, when I was 48 years old and involved in organizations for women's and human rights and also an active member. Now I am 66 years old and the hate campaign of obviously many women-hating perpetrators who at least more than sympathize with the Islamic apartheid that women are completely worthless and are only suitable as sex objects is going on.
Sexualized, misogynistic and often very personal - online violence is increasing rapidly. The perpetrators usually go unmolested. It doesn't matter what you look like, it is enough that you open your mouth as a woman, as a young woman or as a woman in general. We expose these men and these haters by showing that we have brains. And that what they are trying to portray, their image of women, does not correspond at all to what we portray: the strong woman who is not allowed to exist in her world. And that's why we are an enemy. And that's why they go into the personal and try to hurt women with it.
The violence women experience online is mostly sexualized, clearly misogynistic and often very personal. Female Politicians receive hardcore porn with their heads mounted. Female Journalists are advertised on relevant websites as prostitutes on the Internet. Female Climate activists have to protect their private addresses because the rapists would like to drop by in real life. And of course there are also the dick pics: photos of penises that younger women in particular receive unsolicited direct messages on social media. This development leaves its mark - on women themselves, but not least in our society. Net violence is changing the way women move, behave and express themselves on the Internet. Many consider very carefully which topics they are still addressing on social media. You censor yourself to protect yourself. According to a European study, every second woman stays out of discussions on social networks after such experiences. Politicians are resigning from their offices or no longer running because they can no longer stand the online hatred. Women journalists are more often affected by depression and anxiety disorders due to hatred on the net, report less on certain topics or even consider getting out of journalism altogether. Much of what women have fought for in analogue life since the women's movement is being questioned again online - and often remains unchallenged or unpunished.

Because that is also part of the truth: Many women who defend themselves and go to the police to file a complaint are ridiculed. They are asked why they have to ""provoke so"" or why they not just delete their Facebook account when everything is so bad. Prosecutors are quick to drop proceedings because they do not recognize violence against women as such and do not punish it as hate crime. It takes consistent law enforcement. This can only happen if the authorities are aware that misogyny on the Internet is not a trivial matter and not a coincidence. This not only requires more women in the apparatus, but also training and a management culture that does not downplay or glorify violence against women. Legislation is needed that addresses violence against women. Because if perpetrators are not held accountable, hatred and violence against women in public become a bit more normal every day.

And we, who are part of this public, can help to draw red lines. By supporting women who are being attacked on the internet every day in front of all of us. In concrete terms, this means: solidarity in the comment columns, by direct message or by retweet. Anyone who receives support cannot be silenced so quickly. Knowing that you are not alone is still a great motivation for many politically active women online, not to give up and to oppose the hatred.

We must say it very clear: The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

With her secret revealed, she was faced with the question, “why did you stay?” This is her answer to the question. She is a force to be reckoned with and she has survived to tell her tale.

Family Law Attorneys, this will be a great gift for your next client that has taken the first step to end their misery in a terrible relationship. Domestic violence is very real, very painful and unforgettable. I am so proud of our friend, Mekisha Jane Walker, for sharing her personal story and providing resources to help those in need.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

The book provides detailed answers to a wide array of questions that bother scholars and charts a way forward.

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the partial or complete removal of the external female genitals for cultural rather than medical or religious reasons―its origin is unknown. Practitioners believe the procedure enhances the girl’s health, hygiene, chastity, fertility and marriage prospects―the truth is it obliterates sexual pleasure, causes severe health problems and is sometimes fatal. This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

Beautiful: A beautiful girl. An evil man. One inspiring true story of courage/Katie Piper (Author)

But then she met Daniel Lynch on Facebook and her world quickly turned into a nightmare ...

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

The Burning Bed is the true story of Francine Hughes who killed her abusive ex-husband, Mickey, after enduring over a dozen years of emotional, financial and physical abuse. On March 9, 1977, in her home in Lansing, Michigan, Francine Hughes poured gas around her ex-husband's bed and lit it on fire.

The Accuser: The True Story of the Big Dan's Gang Rape Victim / Karen Curtis (Autor)
Cheryl Ann Araujo is The Accuser. In 1983, she was victimized by men, the judicial system, the Government, the media, and the Portuguese mob because she stood up against them all in the Big Dan's rape trial in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
In 1988, Jodie Foster portrayed a character loosely based on Cheryl Araujo in the Hollywood movie The Accused for which she won an Academy Award. Foster's character was gang raped on a pinball machine, rather than a pool table.
But, by the time the movie was released Cheryl was already dead. After the rape trials, she was run out of Massachusetts due to death threats and in 1986, died in a single-car accident in South Florida. Her two young daughters were with her in the car and survived. They recall what happened that fateful day in this book.
This is the true story about what the government and Hollywood do not want you to know regarding one young woman's fight as an accuser to tell her true story to a jury and to the world without being ""victim blamed."" Cheryl was one of the first accusers to face a camera in the courtroom shaping the way the media and judicial system covers rape trials today. Her grueling experience also planted the first seeds of today's burgeoning #MeToo movement.
The book contains never before published information, interviews, and photographs about the life and death of Cheryl Araujo, one of the most tragic accusers and heroines in American history.",0,0,Event,27239635,0,comment,2021-04-21 18:34:49+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],dc-entertainment-keep-amber-heard-as-mera-womens-rights-ambassador-for-aclu-united-nations-champion-lgbt-and-elon-musk,dc-entertainment-keep-amber-heard-as-mera-womens-rights-ambassador-for-aclu-united-nations-champion-lgbt-and-elon-musk_limit_1,for

“Every woman is a sister of another woman born within or outside her race. Women have the power to unite the world for they have one link to the universe--their caring and loving hearts.”
― Princess Maleiha Bajunaid Candao

Never any doubt that a group of thoughtful, brave and strong women and girls can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. We women and girls are strong and can change the world to a better one because without us it will not work! It must be our ultimate goal that female babies, children, girls and women can live fearless, free and self-determined anywhere in the world. It can not be that in the 21st century, men continue to have the power about their lives, their bodies, their freedom, their education, their occupation,their birth control. It can not be that girls and women are still being talked worldwide by brainwashing, they are only happy with men and daily intercourses in their lives. The media report daily where the whole thing leads to femicide, infanticides, domestic and sexual violence, rape culture, mass, gang and war rapes, misogyny, FGM, forced and child marriages, forced prostitution, trafficking in women and girls, sexual slavery, acid attacks, honor killings, dowry murders, widow murders, witch hunts, sex murders, domestic murders, sexual and sadistic stalking, slavery, forced veiling, catcalling, sexual harassment, hate speech and persecution in the name of all men made religions, verbal violence, hate speech and sexism in the society and media, , victim blaming, lynching, lashing, executions (stoning and burning alive) and imprisonment of female victims, even childs, to the compulsion to marry, to have sexual intercourse, to give birth to children, to give up because of men on education and occupation.

Unfortunately, for 17 years, I have been affected by cyberstalking, cyberbullying, identity theft on the internet, hate speech and defamation on the social medial, constant hacker attacks. The culprit is a former psychopathic and women-hating tenant and all his friends, relatives and acquaintances. These people make a sport of chasing and harassing women and girls on the Internet. My female friends, acquaintances and colleagues were also affected. I was obviously also sent real rape pornos, sadistic BDSM porn and rape threats and death threats. These people must finally get long prison sentences in jail. It can not be that such heinous criminals are allowed to continue.

The mirror of the situation worldwide: The misogyny on the Social Media:

The Unsafety Net: How Social Media Turned Against Women

Under the banner of free speech, companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been host to rape videos and revenge porn—which makes female users feel anything but free!!!

In December 2012, an Icelandic woman named Thorlaug Agustsdottir discovered a Facebook group called “Men are better than women.” One image she found there, Thorlaug wrote to us this summer in an email, “was of a young woman naked chained to pipes or an oven in what looked like a concrete basement, all bruised and bloody. She looked with a horrible broken look at whoever was taking the pic of her curled up naked.” Thorlaug wrote an outraged post about it on her own Facebook page.
Before long, a user at “Men are better than women” posted an image of Thorlaug’s face, altered to appear bloody and bruised. Under the image, someone commented, “Women are like grass, they need to be beaten/cut regularly.” Another wrote: “You just need to be raped.” Thorlaug reported the image and comments to Facebook and requested that the site remove them.

“We reviewed the photo you reported,” came Facebook’s auto reply, “but found it does not violate Facebook’s Community Standards on hate speech, which includes posts or photos that attack a person based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition.”

Instead, the Facebook screeners labeled the content “Controversial Humor.” Thorlaug saw nothing funny about it. She worried the threats were real.
Some 50 other users sent their own requests on her behalf. All received the same reply. Eventually, on New Year’s Eve, Thorlaug called the local press, and the story spread from there. Only then was the image removed.

In January 2013, Wired published a critical account of Facebook’s response to these complaints. A company spokesman contacted the publication immediately to explain that Facebook screeners had mishandled the case, conceding that Thorlaug’s photo “should have been taken down when it was reported to us.” According to the spokesman, the company tries to address complaints about images on a case-by-case basis within 72 hours, but with millions of reports to review every day, “it’s not easy to keep up with requests.” The spokesman, anonymous to Wired readers, added, “We apologize for the mistake.”
If, as the communications philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously said, television brought the brutality of war into people’s living rooms, the Internet today is bringing violence against women out of it. Once largely hidden from view, this brutality is now being exposed in unprecedented ways. In the words of Anne Collier, co-director of ConnectSafely.org and co-chair of the Obama administration’s Online Safety and Technology Working Group, “We are in the middle of a global free speech experiment.” On the one hand, these online images and words are bringing awareness to a longstanding problem. On the other hand, the amplification of these ideas over social media networks is validating and spreading pathology.

In other words, social media is more symptom than disease: A 2013 report from the World Health Organization called violence against women “a global health problem of epidemic proportion,” from domestic abuse, stalking, and street harassment to sex trafficking, rape, and murder. This epidemic is thriving in the petri dish of social media.

While some of the aggression against women online occurs between people who know one another, and is unquestionably illegal, most of it happens between strangers. Earlier this year, Pacific Standard published a long story by Amanda Hess about an online stalker who set up a Twitter account specifically to send her death threats.

Across websites and social media platforms, everyday sexist comments exist along a spectrum that also includes illicit sexual surveillance, “creepshots,” extortion, doxxing, stalking, malicious impersonation, threats, and rape videos and photographs. The explosive use of the Internet to conduct human trafficking also has a place on this spectrum, given that three-quarters of trafficked people are girls and women.

A report, “Misogyny on Twitter,” released by the research and policy organization Demos this June, found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter between December 26, 2013, and February 9, 2014. (The words “bitch” and “cunt” were not measured.) An estimated 20 percent of the misogyny study Tweets appeared, to researchers, to be threatening. An example: ""@XXX @XXX You stupid ugly fucking slut I’ll go to your flat and cut your fucking head off you inbred whore.""

In summer 2016, VidCon, an annual nationwide convention held in Southern California, women vloggers shared an astonishing number of examples. The violent threats posted beneath YouTube videos, they observed, are pushing women off of this and other platforms in disproportionate numbers. When Anita Sarkeesian launched a Kickstarter to help fund a feminist video series called Tropes vs. Women, she became the focus of a massive and violently misogynistic cybermob. Among the many forms of harassment she endured was a game where thousands of players “won” by virtually bludgeoning her face. In late August, she contacted the police and had to leave her home after she received a series of serious violent online threats.

Danielle Keats Citron, law professor at the University of Maryland and author of the recently released book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, explained, “Time and time again, these women have no idea often who it is attacking them. A cybermob jumps on board, and one can imagine that the only thing the attackers know about the victim is that she’s female.” Looking at 1,606 cases of “revenge porn,” where explicit photographs are distributed without consent, Citron found that 90 percent of targets were women. Another study she cited found that 70 percent of female gamers chose to play as male characters rather than contend with sexual harassment.

This type of harassment also fills the comment sections of popular websites. In August 2016, employees of the largely female-staffed website Jezebel published an open letter to the site’s parent company, Gawker, detailing the professional, physical, and emotional costs of having to look at the pornographic GIFs maliciously populating the site’s comments sections everyday. “It’s like playing whack-a-mole with a sociopathic Hydra,” they wrote, insisting that Gawker develop tools for blocking and tracking IP addresses. They added, “It’s impacting our ability to do our jobs.”

For some, the costs are higher. In 2010, 12-year-old Amanda Todd bared her chest while chatting online with a person who’d assured her that he was a boy, but was in fact a grown man with a history of pedophilia. For the next two years, Amanda and her mother, Carol Todd, were unable to stop anonymous users from posting that image on sexually explicit pages. A Facebook page, labeled “Controversial Humor,” used Amanda’s name and image—and the names and images of other girls—without consent. In October 2012, Amanda committed suicide, posting a YouTube video that explained her harassment and her decision. In April 2014, Dutch officials announced that they had arrested a 35-year-old man suspected to have used the Internet to extort dozens of girls, including Amanda, in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The suspect now faces charges of child pornography, extortion, criminal harassment, and Internet luring.

Almost immediately after Amanda shared her original image, altered versions appeared on pages, and videos proliferated. One of the pages was filled with pictures of naked pre-pubescent girls, encouraging them to drink bleach and die. While she appreciates the many online tributes honoring her daughter, Carol Todd is haunted by “suicide humor” and pornographic content now forever linked to her daughter’s image. There are web pages dedicated to what is now called “Todding.” One of them features a photograph of a young woman hanging.

Meanwhile, extortion of other victims continues. In an increasing number of countries, rapists are now filming their rapes on cell phones so they can blackmail victims out of reporting the crimes. In August, after a 16-year-old Indian girl was gang-raped, she explained, “I was afraid. While I was being raped, another man pointed a gun and recorded me with his cellphone camera. He said he will upload the film on the Net if I tell my family or the police.”

In Pakistan, the group Bytes for All—an organization that previously sued the government for censoring YouTube videos—released a study showing that social media and mobile tech are causing real harm to women in the country. Gul Bukhari, the report’s author, told Reuters, “These technologies are helping to increase violence against women, not just mirroring it.”

In June 2014, a 16-year-old girl named Jada was drugged and raped at a party in Texas. Partygoers posted a photo of her lying unconscious, one leg bent back. Soon, other Internet users had turned it into a meme, mocking her pose and using the hashtag #jadapose. Kasari Govender, executive director of the Vancouver-based West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), calls this kind of behavior “cybermisogyny.” “Cyberbullying,” she says, “has become this term that’s often thrown around with little understanding. We think it’s important to name the forces that are motivating this in order to figure out how to address it.”

In an unusually bold act, Jada responded by speaking publicly about her rape and the online abuse that followed. Supporters soon took to the Internet in her defense. “There’s no point in hiding,” she told a television reporter. “Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but that’s not what I am and who I am. I’m just angry.”

After Facebook removed Thorlaug’s altered image and the rape threats, she felt relieved, but she was angry too. “These errors are going to manifest again,” she told Wired, “if there isn’t clear enough policy.”

Yet, at the time of Thorlaug’s report, Facebook did have a clear policy. Its detailed Community Standards for speech, often considered the industry’s gold standard, were bolstered by reporting tools that allowed users to report offensive content, and Thorlaug had used these tools as instructed. But serious errors were still manifesting regularly.

Not long after Thorlaug’s struggle to remove her image, a Facebook user posted a video documenting the gang rape of a woman by the side of a road in Malaysia. The six minutes of graphic footage were live for more than three weeks, during which Facebook moderators declined repeated requests for removal.

Around the same time, another Icelandic woman, Hildur Lilliendahl Viggósdóttir, decided to draw attention to similar problems by creating a page called “Men who hate women,” where she reposted examples of misogyny she found elsewhere on Facebook. Her page was suspended four times—not because of its offensive content, but because she was reposting images without written permission. Meanwhile, the original postings—graphically depicting rape and glorifying the physical abuse of women—remained on Facebook. As activists had been noting for years, pages like these were allowed by Facebook to remain under the category of “humor.” Other humorous pages live at the time had names like “I kill bitches like you,” “Domestic Violence: Don’t Make Me Tell You Twice,” “I Love the Rape Van,” and “Raping Babies Because You’re Fucking Fearless.”

For online harassers, this is often an overt goal: to silence female community members, whether through sexual slurs or outright threats. It’s little surprise that the Internet has become a powerful tool in intimate partner violence: A 2012 survey conducted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) found that 89 percent of local domestic violence programs reported victims who were experiencing technology-enabled abuse, often across multiple platforms.

For their part, social media companies often express commitment to user safety, but downplay their influence on the broader culture. Administrators repeatedly explain that their companies, while very concerned with protecting users, are not in the business of policing free speech. As Twitter co-founder Biz Stone phrased it in a post titled “Tweets Must Flow,” “We strive not to remove Tweets on the basis of their content.” The company’s guidelines encourage readers to unfollow the offensive party and “express your feelings [to a trusted friend] so you can move on.”

None of this was of much help to Caroline Criado-Perez, a British journalist and feminist who helped get a picture of Jane Austen on the £10 banknote. The day Bank of England made the announcement, Criado-Perez began receiving more than 50 violent threats per hour on Twitter. “The immediate impact was that I couldn’t eat or sleep,” she told The Guardian in 2013. She asked Twitter to find some way to stop the threats, but at the time the company offered no mechanism for reporting abuse. Since then, the company has released a reporting button, but its usefulness is extremely limited: It requires that every tweet be reported separately, a cumbersome process that gives the user no way of explaining that she is a target of ongoing harassment. (The system currently provides no field for comments.)

For that reasons, when social media companies fail to respond to complaints and requests, victims of online harassment frequently turn to individuals who can publicize their cases. Trista Hendren, an Oregon-based blogger, became an advocate for other women after readers from Iceland, Egypt, Australia, India, Lebanon, and the UK began asking her to write about their experiences. “I was overwhelmed,” she told us. In December 2012, Hendren and several collaborators created a Facebook page called RapeBook where users could flag and report offensive content that the company had refused to take down.

By April 2013, people were using RapeBook to post pictures of women and pre-pubescent girls being raped or beaten. Some days, Hendren received more than 500 anonymous, explicitly violent comments—“I will skull-fuck your children,” for instance. Facebook users tracked down and posted her address, her children’s names, and her phone number and started to call her.

By that time, Hendren had abandoned any hope that using Facebook’s reporting mechanisms could help her. She was able, however, to work directly with a Facebook moderator to address the threats and criminal content. She found that the company sincerely wanted to help. Their representatives discussed the posts with her on a case-by-case basis, but more violent and threatening posts kept coming, and much of the content she considered graphic and abusive was allowed to remain.

Facebook’s people, she said, told her they didn’t consider the threats to her and her family credible or legitimate. Hendren, however, was concerned enough to contact the police and the FBI. The FBI started an investigation; meanwhile Hendren, physically and emotionally spent, suspended her Facebook account. “I was the sickest I have ever been,” she said. “It was really disgusting work. We just began to think, ‘Why are we devoting all our efforts on a volunteer basis to do work that Facebook—with billions of dollars—should be taking care of?’”

Hendren contacted Soraya, who continued to press Facebook directly. At the same time, Soraya and Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, also began comparing notes on what readers were sending them. Bates was struck by surprising ad placements. At the time, a photo captioned “The bitch didn’t know when to shut up” appeared alongside ads for Dove and iTunes. “Domestic Violence: Don’t Make Me Tell You Twice”—a page filled with photos of women beaten, bruised, and bleeding—was populated by ads for Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg’s new bestselling book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.

In early May, Bates decided to tweet at one of these companies. “Hi @Finnair here’s your ad on another domestic violence page—will you stop advertising with Facebook?” FinnAir responded immediately: “It is totally against our values and policies. Thanks @r2ph! @everydaysexism Could you send us the URL please so that we can take action?”

Soraya, Bates, and Jaclyn Friedman, the executive director of Women, Action, and Media, a media justice advocacy group, joined forces and launched a social media campaign designed to attract advertisers’ attention. The ultimate goal was to press Facebook to recognize explicit violence against women as a violation of its own prohibitions against hate speech, graphic violence, and harassment. Within a day of beginning the campaign, 160 organizations and corporations had co-signed a public letter, and in less than a week, more than 60,000 tweets were shared using the campaign’s #FBrape hashtag. Nissan was the first company to pull its advertising dollars from Facebook altogether. More than 15 others soon followed. The letter emphasized that Facebook’s refusal to take down content that glorified and trivialized graphic rape and domestic violence was actually hampering free expression—it was “marginaliz[ing] girls and women, sidelin[ing] our experiences and concerns, and contribut[ing] to violence against us.”

When Emily Bazelon, author of a book and a March 2013 Atlantic story about Internet bullies, visited Facebook’s headquarters, the young men she saw working as moderators were spending roughly 30 seconds assessing each reported post, millions of reports a week. Outsourced speech moderation has become a booming industry. Like Facebook’s own moderation process, the operations of these companies are opaque by design.

In late June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would hear the case of Anthony Elonis, a man with five charges of sexual harassment, who was imprisoned after threatening to kill his wife on Facebook. Elonis insists that his Facebook posts were not real threats but protected speech. Tara Elonis, his estranged wife—possibly aware that most female murder victims are killed by intimate partners—said that there was nothing unthreatening about her husband’s Facebook posts and that they forced her to take necessary, costly precautions. “If I only knew then what I know now,” read one, “I would have smothered your ass with a pillow, dumped your body in the back seat, dropped you off in Toad Creek, and made it look like a rape and murder.""

In late August 2016, Drew Curtis, founder of the content aggregator FARK, announced that the company had added “misogyny” to its moderation guidelines. FARK no longer allows rape jokes or threats. It also prohibited posts that call groups of women ""whores"" or ""sluts,"" or suggest that a woman who suffered a crime is somehow asking for it. In a note to readers, Curtis wrote, “This represents enough of a departure from pretty much how every other large Internet community operates that I figure an announcement is necessary.” Responding in Slate, Amanda Hess praised FARK’s new policy but also pointed out its limitations: Just underneath his announcement, users posted dozens of comments about rape, whores, and “boobies.”

What kind of world ist that, what kind of world for all females?

On a cold February night in 1991, a group of soldiers and officers of the Indian army stormed into two villages in Kashmir, seeking out militants assumed to be hiding there. Incensed at the villagers&; refusal to share any information, soldiers pulled residents from their homes, torturing men and raping women. According to village accounts, as many as thirty-one women were raped. The Indian army initially carried out cursory investigations before shelving the case without explanation. Kunan and Poshpora have since become known as the villages of raped women, and their residents have found it difficult to escape this stigma.

The Accuser: The True Story of the Big Dan's Gang Rape Victim/ Karen Curtis (Autor) 
Cheryl Ann Araujo is The Accuser. In 1983, she was victimized by men, the judicial system, the Government, the media, and the Portuguese mob because she stood up against them all in the Big Dan's rape trial in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
In 1988, Jodie Foster portrayed a character loosely based on Cheryl Araujo in the Hollywood movie The Accused for which she won an Academy Award. Foster's character was gang raped on a pinball machine, rather than a pool table.
But, by the time the movie was released Cheryl was already dead. After the rape trials, she was run out of Massachusetts due to death threats and in 1986, died in a single-car accident in South Florida. Her two young daughters were with her in the car and survived. They recall what happened that fateful day in this book.
This is the true story about what the government and Hollywood do not want you to know regarding one young woman's fight as an accuser to tell her true story to a jury and to the world without being ""victim blamed."" Cheryl was one of the first accusers to face a camera in the courtroom shaping the way the media and judicial system covers rape trials today. Her grueling experience also planted the first seeds of today's burgeoning #MeToo movement.
The book contains never before published information, interviews, and photographs about the life and death of Cheryl Araujo, one of the most tragic accusers and heroines in American history.

Perspectives on Stalking: Victims, Perpetrators, and Cyberstalking/ Roland Maiuro (Herausgeber) 
Each year an estimated 3.4 million men and women become victims of stalking. While a man in a black coat following a girl in a dark alley is the medias stereotypical portrayal of stalking, there is actually a wide range of behavior that can be defined as such. Stalkingcharacterized by harassment, repeated calling, sending inappropriate letters or gifts, unsuitable use of social media, confrontation, and other unwanted behaviorsis a worldwide problem that is on the rise, especially the incidence and prevalence of cyberstalking. This book presents a collection of prominent articles published in the peer-reviewed journalViolence and Victims, written by experts on stalking from a variety of social science disciplines. Authors present research related to stalking victims and perpetrators, cyberstalking, how to identify stalking, and stalking in a variety of settings with a focus on college campuses.
College students, many of whom are relatively new to intimate relationships, are especially prone to becoming stalked or perpetrating stalking. Several articles in this collection address stalking within the college population, including an empirical study of stalking victimization in men and women and a discussion of coping strategies at a Finnish university. Authors examine varying perceptions and attitudes toward stalking on campus, and discuss how to draw the line between courtship behavior and stalking. Personality attributes of stalkers include, according to one study, less social competence and a greater tendency to display borderline behaviors. Studies also address the relationship between stalking and gender, the stalking experiences of battered women, and the growing incidence of cyberstalking. This book will provide a solid research foundation toward understanding and controlling stalking behaviors, which can potentially lead to more serious abuse.

The Stoning of Soraya M.: A Story of Injustice in Iran/Freidoune Sahebjam (Autor)
Soraya M.’s husband, Ghorban-Ali, couldn’t afford to marry another woman. Rather than returning Soraya’s dowry, as custom required before taking a second wife, he plotted with four friends and a counterfeit mullah to dispose of her. Together, they accused Soraya of adultery. Her only crime was cooking for a friend’s widowed husband. Exhausted by a lifetime of abuse and hardship, Soraya said nothing, and the makeshift tribunal took her silence as a confession of guilt. They sentenced her to death by stoning: a punishment prohibited by Islam but widely practiced.
Day by day—sometimes minute by minute—Sahebjam deftly recounts these horrendous events, tracing Soraya’s life with searing immediacy, from her arranged marriage and the births of her children to her husband’s increasing cruelty and her horrifying execution, where, by tradition, her father, husband, and sons hurled the first stones. A stark look at the intersection between culture and justice, this is one woman’s story, but it stands for the stories of thousands of women who suffered—and continue to suffer—the same fate. It is a story that must be told.

What We’re Told Not to Talk About (But We’re Going to Anyway): Women’s Voices from East London to Ethiopia /Nimko Ali (Autor)
14 COUNTRIES, 42 WOMEN - FROM PERIODS TO ORGASMS TO FGM. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS OVERSHARING.
'Nimko's book is going to shift the conversation around women's bodies. Our bodies, and everything they do, make us who we are' - Amika George, founder of Free Periods Campaign
______________________
What do you do when you're homeless and on your period? What does it feel like to have a poo following childbirth? How do we learn to love our bodies again after they've been abused?
It's rude. It's improper. It's disgusting. All justifications that leave women's questions about their bodies unanswered. And activist Nimko Ali has had enough of it.
Following her own experience of FGM and rebuilding her relationship with her body, this important book contains the true stories of women sharing what they've always been told is secret and shameful - from east London to Ethiopia, from pregnancy to menopause.
This is a call to arms. This is a cry to reclaim the narrative around our fannies and to refuse the taboos that silent us.
______________________
'A beautiful book with such a wide range of uplifting but often heart-breaking stories. Made us cry and think in equal measure' - Pandora Sykes, co-host of The High Low
'Nimko has blown apart all taboos, blown apart the echo chamber and included all women in the feminist conversation.' - Scarlett Curtis, author of Feminists Don't Wear Pink
'There is no subject too taboo for her to tackle. We should all be talking about our vaginas and she is leading the way' - Bryony Gordon, author of Mad Girl
'Nimko Ali is heroine for our time, she destroys the notion of things being too rude to discuss' - Caitlin Moran, author of How to Be a Woman

Notes on a Silencing: A Memoir /Lacy Crawford (Autor)
A ""powerful and scary and important and true"" memoir of a young woman's struggle to regain her sense of self after trauma, and the efforts by a powerful New England boarding school to silence her—at any cost (Sally Mann, author of Hold Still).
When Notes on a Silencing hit bookstores in the summer of 2020, even amidst a global pandemic, it sent shockwaves through the country. Not only did this intimate investigative memoir usher in a media storm of coverage, but it also prompted the elite St. Paul's School to issue a formal apology to the author, Lacy Crawford, for its handling of her report of sexual assault by two fellow students nearly thirty years ago.
In this searing book, Crawford tells the story of coming forward during the state investigation of the elite New England prep school decades after her assault, only to find for the first time evidence that corroborated her memories. Here were depictions of the naïve, hardworking girl she’d been, as well as astonishing proof of an institutional silencing. The slander, innuendo, and lack of adult concern that Crawford had experienced as a student hadn't been imagined; they were the actions of a school that prized its reputation above anything, even a child.
 This revelation launched Crawford on an extraordinary inquiry deep into gender, privilege, and power, and the ways shame and guilt are used to silence victims. Insightful, arresting, and beautifully written, Notes on a Silencing wrestles with an essential question for our time: what telling of a survivor's story will finally force a remedy?",0,0,Event,25778741,0,comment,2021-03-19 08:44:43+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],warner-brothers-justice-for-johnny-depp-05f8b1e1-9f45-4f3a-99a5-ba483539fbbd,warner-brothers-justice-for-johnny-depp-05f8b1e1-9f45-4f3a-99a5-ba483539fbbd_limit_1,against

813613249,"""We must send a message across the world that there is no disgrace in being a survivor of sexual violence. The shame is on the aggressor. ""– Angelina Jolie

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home for if a woman cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere.”

""Pornography is used in rape - to plan it, to execute it, to choreograph it, to engender the excitement to commit the act."" [Andrea testimony before the New York Attorney General's Commission on Pornography in 1986]
-Andrea Dworkin

"" Men, permitted to put words (and other things) in women's mouths, create scenes in which women desperately want to be bound, battered, tortured, humiliated, and killed.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”

“The rape of a child is a violent act of contempt, not an expression of sexuality or affection.”
― Mike Lew, Gay Men and Childhood Sexual Trauma

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""
-Andrea Dworkin

"" Women are socially disadvantaged in controlling sexual access to their bodies through socialization to customs that define a woman's body as for sexual use by men. Sexual access is regularly forced or pressured or routinized beyond denial.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 16 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

books about:

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

The book provides detailed answers to a wide array of questions that bother scholars and charts a way forward.

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome.

This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

Our Bodies, Their Battlefields: War Through the Lives of Women /Christina Lamb (Author
From Christina Lamb, the coauthor of the bestselling I Am Malala and an award-winning journalist—an essential, groundbreaking examination of how women exerience war. In Our Bodies, Their Battlefields, longtime intrepid war correspondent Christina Lamb makes us witness to the lives of women in wartime. An award-winning war correspondent for twenty-five years (she’s never had a female editor) Lamb reports two wars—the “bang-bang” war and the story of how the people behind the lines live and survive. At the same time, since men usually act as the fighters, women are rarely interviewed about their experience of wartime, other than as grieving widows and mothers, though their experience is markedly different from that of the men involved in battle.
Lamb chronicles extraordinary tragedy and challenges in the lives of women in wartime. And none is more devastating than the increase of the use of rape as a weapon of war. Visiting warzones including the Congo, Rwanda, Nigeria, Bosnia, and Iraq, and spending time with the Rohingya fleeing Myanmar, she records the harrowing stories of survivors, from Yazidi girls kept as sex slaves by ISIS fighters and the beekeeper risking his life to rescue them; to the thousands of schoolgirls abducted across northern Nigeria by Boko Haram, to the Congolese gynecologist who stitches up more rape victims than anyone on earth. Told as a journey, and structured by country, Our Bodies, Their Battlefields gives these women voice.
We have made significant progress in international women’s rights, but across the world women are victimized by wartime atrocities that are rarely recorded, much less punished. The first ever prosecution for war rape was in 1997 and there have been remarkably few convictions since, as if rape doesn’t matter in the reckoning of war, only killing. Some courageous women in countries around the world are taking things in their own hands, hunting down the war criminals themselves, trying to trap them through Facebook.
In this profoundly important book, Christina Lamb shines a light on some of the darkest parts of the human experience—so that we might find a new way forward. Our Bodies, Their Battlefields is as inspiring and empowering is as it is urgent, a clarion call for necessary change.

Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching / Crystal N. Feimster (Author) 
Between 1880 and 1930, close to 200 women were murdered by lynch mobs in the American South. Many more were tarred and feathered, burned, whipped, or raped. In this brutal world of white supremacist politics and patriarchy, a world violently divided by race, gender, and class, black and white women defended themselves and challenged the male power brokers. Crystal Feimster breaks new ground in her story of the racial politics of the postbellum South by focusing on the volatile issue of sexual violence.
Pairing the lives of two Southern women―Ida B. Wells, who fearlessly branded lynching a white tool of political terror against southern blacks, and Rebecca Latimer Felton, who urged white men to prove their manhood by lynching black men accused of raping white women―Feimster makes visible the ways in which black and white women sought protection and political power in the New South. While Wells was black and Felton was white, both were journalists, temperance women, suffragists, and anti-rape activists. By placing their concerns at the center of southern politics, Feimster illuminates a critical and novel aspect of southern racial and sexual dynamics. Despite being on opposite sides of the lynching question, both Wells and Felton sought protection from sexual violence and political empowerment for women.
Southern Horrors provides a startling view into the Jim Crow South where the precarious and subordinate position of women linked black and white anti-rape activists together in fragile political alliances. It is a story that reveals how the complex drama of political power, race, and sex played out in the lives of Southern women.

Death in Salem: The Private Lives Behind The 1692 Witch Hunt / Diane Foulds (Author) 
Salem witchcraft will always have a magnetic pull on the American psyche. During the 1692 witch trials, more than 150 people were arrested. An estimated 25 million Americans—including author Diane Foulds—are descended from the twenty individuals executed. What happened to our ancestors? Death in Salem is the first book to take a clear-eyed look at this complex time, by examining the lives of the witch trial participants from a personal perspective.  
Massachusetts settlers led difficult lives; every player in the Salem drama endured hardships barely imaginable today. Mercy Short, one of the “bewitched” girls, watched as Indians butchered her parents; Puritan minister Cotton Mather outlived all but three of his fifteen children. Such tragedies shaped behavior and, as Foulds argues, ultimately played a part in the witch hunt’s outcome. A compelling “who’s who” to Salem witchcraft, Death in Salem profiles each of these historical personalities as it asks: Why was this person targeted?

Making a Killing: Femicide, Free Trade, and La Frontera/Alicia Gaspar de Alba (Editor)
Since 1993, more than five hundred women and girls have been murdered in Ciudad Juárez across the border from El Paso, Texas. At least a third have been sexually violated and mutilated as well. Thousands more have been reported missing and remain unaccounted for. The crimes have been poorly investigated and have gone unpunished and unresolved by Mexican authorities, thus creating an epidemic of misogynist violence on an increasingly globalized U.S.-Mexico border.
This book, the first anthology to focus exclusively on the Juárez femicides, as the crimes have come to be known, compiles several different scholarly ""interventions"" from diverse perspectives, including feminism, Marxism, critical race theory, semiotics, and textual analysis. Editor Alicia Gaspar de Alba shapes a multidisciplinary analytical framework for considering the interconnections between gender, violence, and the U.S.-Mexico border. The essays examine the social and cultural conditions that have led to the heinous victimization of women on the border—from globalization, free trade agreements, exploitative maquiladora working conditions, and border politics, to the sexist attitudes that pervade the social discourse about the victims. The book also explores the evolving social movement that has been created by NGOs, mothers' organizing efforts, and other grassroots forms of activism related to the crimes. Contributors include U.S. and Mexican scholars and activists, as well as personal testimonies of two mothers of femicide victims.

A Killer's Confession: How I Brought My Daughter’s Murderer to Justice /
Karen Edwards (Author)
A mother's fight to bring her daughter's killer, Christopher Halliwell, to justice
'I have lived every parent's worst nightmare. On what would have been my daughter's 29th birthday, Detective Superintendent Stephen Fulcher knocked on the door and told me my beautiful Becky was dead. Found buried in a shallow grave in a remote field, Becky had been brutally murdered.'
When Becky Godden-Edwards was killed, her mother Karen awoke to a world where the truth was never guaranteed; where taxi driver Christopher Halliwell got away with murder and the police officer who found her daughter was punished instead.
This is Karen's story. Despite unimaginable tragedy, her love for her daughter has been unbreakable: from her despair through Becky's troubled teenage years, to the agonising eight years when Becky was missing, and then the dramatic story of how a killer's confession led to a terrible discovery.
The one constant has been Karen's determination to fight for Becky, tirelessly campaigning for the truth about what happened to be heard and for Halliwell to face the consequences of his evil actions.
*The murders of Becky Godden-Edwards and Sian O'Callaghan will soon be the focus of major new ITV series A Confession starring Martin Freeman as Stephen Fulcher and Imelda Staunton as Karen Edwards*

You're the Only One I've Told: The Stories Behind Abortion /Meera Shah (Author)
""Moving, multifaceted, and deeply human...as eye-opening as it is compelling” —Cecile Richards, author of Make Trouble 
At a time where reproductive rights are at risk, these vital stories of diverse individuals serve as a reminder of the importance of empathy, finding community and motivating advocacy .
For a long time, when people asked Dr. Meera Shah, Chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, what she did, she would tell them she was a doctor and leave it at that. But when she started to be direct about her work as an abortion provider an interesting thing started to happen: one by one, people would confide that they'd had an abortion themselves. The refrain was often the same: You're the only one I've told. 
This book collects these stories as they've been told to Shah to humanize abortion and to combat myths that persist in the discourse that surrounds it. A wide range of ages, races, socioeconomic factors, and experiences shows that abortion always occurs in a unique context.  
Today, a healthcare issue that's so precious and foundational to reproductive, social, and economic freedom for millions of people is exploited by politicians who lack understanding or compassion about the context in which abortion occurs. Stories have the power to break down stigmas and help us to empathize with those whose experiences are unlike our own.

100 Times: A Memoir of Sexism/Chavisa Woods (Author)
Shirley Jackson Award-winning author and three-time Lambda Finalist, Chavisa Woods presents one hundred personal stories of sexism, harassment, discrimination, and assault. Recounting her experiences with sexist discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence—beginning in childhood, through the present—Woods lays out clear and unflinching personal vignettes that build in intensity as the number of times grows. Individually, and especially taken as a whole, these stories amount to powerful proof that sexual violence and discrimination are never just one-time occurrences, but part of a constant battle all women face every day.
In these extraordinary pages, sexual violence and sexist discrimination occur regardless of age, in all spheres of society, in rural and urban areas alike, in the US and abroad, from Woods' youth through adulthood. Demonstrating how often people are conditioned to endure sexism and harassment, and how thoroughly men feel entitled to women’s spaces and bodies, 100 Times forces the reader to witness the myriad ways in which sexism and misogyny continuously shape women’s lives, and are built-in facets of our society.

For Laci: A Mother's Story of Love, Loss, and Justice /Sharon Rocha (Author)
Laci Rocha Peterson, 8 months pregnant, was last seen by her sister, Amy, in the late afternoon of December 23, 2002. She spoke to her mother, Sharon Rocha, at 8:30 p.m. that night. This would be the last time anyone from her immediate family ever spoke to her.
A search began which lasted an agonizing four months. Sadly, Laci Peterson and her son Conner were found dead on the shores of San Francisco Bay on April 18, 2003.
Her husband, Scott, was eventually arrested and charged with the murder of Laci and Connor. After a sensational, media-saturated trial, Peterson was found guilty of capital murder and was sentenced to death on March 16, 2005.
This book deals with the story in three separate sections: first, Sharon describes the ordinary, loving life her daughter led, including fond memories of her childhood and adolescence. Second, it covers her marriage, disappearance, the community's moving search for her, and her and Connor's eventual recovery from San Francisco Bay. Third, it tells the story of the trial in detail not before revealed. Sharon will also talk about victim's rights, a subject on which she now campaigns regularly.

""The Rape of Innocence"" is an autobiographical account of a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant woman who discovered she had been the victim of clitoridectomy as a child in Kansas in the 1950s. The author is a therapist who deals with trauma. In her work, she has met many other American women and men who were genitally mutilated as children and adults. Could you -- or someone you love -- have been cut too? This book may explain the U.S. epidemic of sexual dysfunction, anger, anxiety, depression -- unresolved psychological trauma from circumcision. Now that the word is out, the healing can begin.

We Are the Murder Victims Who Lived: A Survivor’s Truth on Sexual Assault /S.K. Menelle (Author)
“We Are the Murder Victims Who Lived” is a gritty and grimy memoir written in the first person, which tackles the surviving of sexual assault while offering hope on life after. It also glimpses into the struggles and shames of life lived during, and a reminiscence on the innocence of life led before. This book serves as a beacon of hope to survivors of sexual assault as well as a wake-up call for a society blinded by darkness. The book targets audiences of every age and gender and sexual orientation, presenting itself as a safe zone specifically for women, a comfort for those previously affected by sexual violence, assault, and abuse. It is also written for those who are trying to understand what has happened to their loved ones, navigating through the unknown. It is an education in the horrors of sexual assault, a spit in the face of the writer’s very own rapist. It paves its way as a testimony to the power of good people. It is an education in the phases that survivors of sexual assault face: denial, hate, hiding, shame, and fear, which then lends itself to hopefulness, unbounding love, and truth. It is a plea for people to listen, forcing us to look at the ways in which we view sex and relationships, and consider whether we will raise our very own sons from boys to men--or from boys to rapists.

The powerful, poignant, bestselling National Book Award Finalist gives voice to a young girl robbed of her childhood yet determined to find the strength to triumph about sex slavery and torture.

Chinese Comfort Women: Testimonies from Imperial Japan's Sex Slaves/Peipei Qiu (Author)
During the Asia-Pacific War, the Japanese military forced hundreds of thousands of women across Asia into ""comfort stations"" where they were repeatedly raped and tortured. Japanese imperial forces claimed they recruited women to join these stations in order to prevent the mass rape of local women and the spread of venereal disease among soldiers. In reality, these women were kidnapped and coerced into  slavery. Estimates of the number of women involved typically range up to 200,000, but the actual number may have been even much higher.

“Every woman is a sister of another woman born within or outside her race. Women have the power to unite the world for they have one link to the universe--their caring and loving hearts.”
― Princess Maleiha Bajunaid Candao

Never any doubt that a group of thoughtful, brave and strong women and girls can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. We women and girls are strong and can change the world to a better one because without us it will not work! It must be our ultimate goal that female babies, children, girls and women can live fearless, free and self-determined anywhere in the world. It can not be that in the 21st century, men continue to have the power about their lives, their bodies, their freedom, their education, their occupation,their birth control. It can not be that girls and women are still being talked worldwide by brainwashing, they are only happy with men and daily intercourses in their lives. The media report daily where the whole thing leads to femicide, infanticides, domestic and sexual violence, rape culture, mass, gang and war rapes, misogyny, FGM, forced and child marriages, forced prostitution, trafficking in women and girls, sexual slavery, acid attacks, honor killings, dowry murders, widow murders, witch hunts, sex murders, domestic murders, sexual and sadistic stalking, slavery, forced veiling, catcalling, sexual harassment, hate speech and persecution in the name of all men made religions, verbal violence, hate speech and sexism in the society and media, , victim blaming, lynching, lashing, executions (stoning and burning alive) and imprisonment of female victims, even childs, to the compulsion to marry, to have sexual intercourse, to give birth to children, to give up because of men on education and occupation.

Unfortunately, for 17 years, I have been affected by cyberstalking, cyberbullying, identity theft on the internet, hate speech and defamation on the social medial, constant hacker attacks. The culprit is a former psychopathic and women-hating tenant and all his friends, relatives and acquaintances. These people make a sport of chasing and harassing women and girls on the Internet. My female friends, acquaintances and colleagues were also affected. I was obviously also sent real rape pornos, sadistic BDSM porn and rape threats and death threats. These people must finally get long prison sentences in jail. It can not be that such heinous criminals are allowed to continue.

The mirror of the situation worldwide: The misogyny on the Social Media:

The Unsafety Net: How Social Media Turned Against Women

Under the banner of free speech, companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been host to rape videos and revenge porn—which makes female users feel anything but free!!!

In December 2012, an Icelandic woman named Thorlaug Agustsdottir discovered a Facebook group called “Men are better than women.” One image she found there, Thorlaug wrote to us this summer in an email, “was of a young woman naked chained to pipes or an oven in what looked like a concrete basement, all bruised and bloody. She looked with a horrible broken look at whoever was taking the pic of her curled up naked.” Thorlaug wrote an outraged post about it on her own Facebook page.
Before long, a user at “Men are better than women” posted an image of Thorlaug’s face, altered to appear bloody and bruised. Under the image, someone commented, “Women are like grass, they need to be beaten/cut regularly.” Another wrote: “You just need to be raped.” Thorlaug reported the image and comments to Facebook and requested that the site remove them.

“We reviewed the photo you reported,” came Facebook’s auto reply, “but found it does not violate Facebook’s Community Standards on hate speech, which includes posts or photos that attack a person based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition.”

Instead, the Facebook screeners labeled the content “Controversial Humor.” Thorlaug saw nothing funny about it. She worried the threats were real.
Some 50 other users sent their own requests on her behalf. All received the same reply. Eventually, on New Year’s Eve, Thorlaug called the local press, and the story spread from there. Only then was the image removed.

In January 2013, Wired published a critical account of Facebook’s response to these complaints. A company spokesman contacted the publication immediately to explain that Facebook screeners had mishandled the case, conceding that Thorlaug’s photo “should have been taken down when it was reported to us.” According to the spokesman, the company tries to address complaints about images on a case-by-case basis within 72 hours, but with millions of reports to review every day, “it’s not easy to keep up with requests.” The spokesman, anonymous to Wired readers, added, “We apologize for the mistake.”
If, as the communications philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously said, television brought the brutality of war into people’s living rooms, the Internet today is bringing violence against women out of it. Once largely hidden from view, this brutality is now being exposed in unprecedented ways. In the words of Anne Collier, co-director of ConnectSafely.org and co-chair of the Obama administration’s Online Safety and Technology Working Group, “We are in the middle of a global free speech experiment.” On the one hand, these online images and words are bringing awareness to a longstanding problem. On the other hand, the amplification of these ideas over social media networks is validating and spreading pathology.

In other words, social media is more symptom than disease: A 2013 report from the World Health Organization called violence against women “a global health problem of epidemic proportion,” from domestic abuse, stalking, and street harassment to sex trafficking, rape, and murder. This epidemic is thriving in the petri dish of social media.

While some of the aggression against women online occurs between people who know one another, and is unquestionably illegal, most of it happens between strangers. Earlier this year, Pacific Standard published a long story by Amanda Hess about an online stalker who set up a Twitter account specifically to send her death threats.

Across websites and social media platforms, everyday sexist comments exist along a spectrum that also includes illicit sexual surveillance, “creepshots,” extortion, doxxing, stalking, malicious impersonation, threats, and rape videos and photographs. The explosive use of the Internet to conduct human trafficking also has a place on this spectrum, given that three-quarters of trafficked people are girls and women.

A report, “Misogyny on Twitter,” released by the research and policy organization Demos this June, found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter between December 26, 2013, and February 9, 2014. (The words “bitch” and “cunt” were not measured.) An estimated 20 percent of the misogyny study Tweets appeared, to researchers, to be threatening. An example: ""@XXX @XXX You stupid ugly fucking slut I’ll go to your flat and cut your fucking head off you inbred whore.""

In summer 2016, VidCon, an annual nationwide convention held in Southern California, women vloggers shared an astonishing number of examples. The violent threats posted beneath YouTube videos, they observed, are pushing women off of this and other platforms in disproportionate numbers. When Anita Sarkeesian launched a Kickstarter to help fund a feminist video series called Tropes vs. Women, she became the focus of a massive and violently misogynistic cybermob. Among the many forms of harassment she endured was a game where thousands of players “won” by virtually bludgeoning her face. In late August, she contacted the police and had to leave her home after she received a series of serious violent online threats.

Danielle Keats Citron, law professor at the University of Maryland and author of the recently released book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, explained, “Time and time again, these women have no idea often who it is attacking them. A cybermob jumps on board, and one can imagine that the only thing the attackers know about the victim is that she’s female.” Looking at 1,606 cases of “revenge porn,” where explicit photographs are distributed without consent, Citron found that 90 percent of targets were women. Another study she cited found that 70 percent of female gamers chose to play as male characters rather than contend with sexual harassment.

This type of harassment also fills the comment sections of popular websites. In August 2016, employees of the largely female-staffed website Jezebel published an open letter to the site’s parent company, Gawker, detailing the professional, physical, and emotional costs of having to look at the pornographic GIFs maliciously populating the site’s comments sections everyday. “It’s like playing whack-a-mole with a sociopathic Hydra,” they wrote, insisting that Gawker develop tools for blocking and tracking IP addresses. They added, “It’s impacting our ability to do our jobs.”

For some, the costs are higher. In 2010, 12-year-old Amanda Todd bared her chest while chatting online with a person who’d assured her that he was a boy, but was in fact a grown man with a history of pedophilia. For the next two years, Amanda and her mother, Carol Todd, were unable to stop anonymous users from posting that image on sexually explicit pages. A Facebook page, labeled “Controversial Humor,” used Amanda’s name and image—and the names and images of other girls—without consent. In October 2012, Amanda committed suicide, posting a YouTube video that explained her harassment and her decision. In April 2014, Dutch officials announced that they had arrested a 35-year-old man suspected to have used the Internet to extort dozens of girls, including Amanda, in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The suspect now faces charges of child pornography, extortion, criminal harassment, and Internet luring.

Almost immediately after Amanda shared her original image, altered versions appeared on pages, and videos proliferated. One of the pages was filled with pictures of naked pre-pubescent girls, encouraging them to drink bleach and die. While she appreciates the many online tributes honoring her daughter, Carol Todd is haunted by “suicide humor” and pornographic content now forever linked to her daughter’s image. There are web pages dedicated to what is now called “Todding.” One of them features a photograph of a young woman hanging.

Meanwhile, extortion of other victims continues. In an increasing number of countries, rapists are now filming their rapes on cell phones so they can blackmail victims out of reporting the crimes. In August, after a 16-year-old Indian girl was gang-raped, she explained, “I was afraid. While I was being raped, another man pointed a gun and recorded me with his cellphone camera. He said he will upload the film on the Net if I tell my family or the police.”

In Pakistan, the group Bytes for All—an organization that previously sued the government for censoring YouTube videos—released a study showing that social media and mobile tech are causing real harm to women in the country. Gul Bukhari, the report’s author, told Reuters, “These technologies are helping to increase violence against women, not just mirroring it.”

In June 2014, a 16-year-old girl named Jada was drugged and raped at a party in Texas. Partygoers posted a photo of her lying unconscious, one leg bent back. Soon, other Internet users had turned it into a meme, mocking her pose and using the hashtag #jadapose. Kasari Govender, executive director of the Vancouver-based West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), calls this kind of behavior “cybermisogyny.” “Cyberbullying,” she says, “has become this term that’s often thrown around with little understanding. We think it’s important to name the forces that are motivating this in order to figure out how to address it.”

In an unusually bold act, Jada responded by speaking publicly about her rape and the online abuse that followed. Supporters soon took to the Internet in her defense. “There’s no point in hiding,” she told a television reporter. “Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but that’s not what I am and who I am. I’m just angry.”

After Facebook removed Thorlaug’s altered image and the rape threats, she felt relieved, but she was angry too. “These errors are going to manifest again,” she told Wired, “if there isn’t clear enough policy.”

Yet, at the time of Thorlaug’s report, Facebook did have a clear policy. Its detailed Community Standards for speech, often considered the industry’s gold standard, were bolstered by reporting tools that allowed users to report offensive content, and Thorlaug had used these tools as instructed. But serious errors were still manifesting regularly.

Not long after Thorlaug’s struggle to remove her image, a Facebook user posted a video documenting the gang rape of a woman by the side of a road in Malaysia. The six minutes of graphic footage were live for more than three weeks, during which Facebook moderators declined repeated requests for removal.

Around the same time, another Icelandic woman, Hildur Lilliendahl Viggósdóttir, decided to draw attention to similar problems by creating a page called “Men who hate women,” where she reposted examples of misogyny she found elsewhere on Facebook. Her page was suspended four times—not because of its offensive content, but because she was reposting images without written permission. Meanwhile, the original postings—graphically depicting rape and glorifying the physical abuse of women—remained on Facebook. As activists had been noting for years, pages like these were allowed by Facebook to remain under the category of “humor.” Other humorous pages live at the time had names like “I kill bitches like you,” “Domestic Violence: Don’t Make Me Tell You Twice,” “I Love the Rape Van,” and “Raping Babies Because You’re Fucking Fearless.”

For online harassers, this is often an overt goal: to silence female community members, whether through sexual slurs or outright threats. It’s little surprise that the Internet has become a powerful tool in intimate partner violence: A 2012 survey conducted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) found that 89 percent of local domestic violence programs reported victims who were experiencing technology-enabled abuse, often across multiple platforms.

For their part, social media companies often express commitment to user safety, but downplay their influence on the broader culture. Administrators repeatedly explain that their companies, while very concerned with protecting users, are not in the business of policing free speech. As Twitter co-founder Biz Stone phrased it in a post titled “Tweets Must Flow,” “We strive not to remove Tweets on the basis of their content.” The company’s guidelines encourage readers to unfollow the offensive party and “express your feelings [to a trusted friend] so you can move on.”

None of this was of much help to Caroline Criado-Perez, a British journalist and feminist who helped get a picture of Jane Austen on the £10 banknote. The day Bank of England made the announcement, Criado-Perez began receiving more than 50 violent threats per hour on Twitter. “The immediate impact was that I couldn’t eat or sleep,” she told The Guardian in 2013. She asked Twitter to find some way to stop the threats, but at the time the company offered no mechanism for reporting abuse. Since then, the company has released a reporting button, but its usefulness is extremely limited: It requires that every tweet be reported separately, a cumbersome process that gives the user no way of explaining that she is a target of ongoing harassment. (The system currently provides no field for comments.)

For that reasons, when social media companies fail to respond to complaints and requests, victims of online harassment frequently turn to individuals who can publicize their cases. Trista Hendren, an Oregon-based blogger, became an advocate for other women after readers from Iceland, Egypt, Australia, India, Lebanon, and the UK began asking her to write about their experiences. “I was overwhelmed,” she told us. In December 2012, Hendren and several collaborators created a Facebook page called RapeBook where users could flag and report offensive content that the company had refused to take down.

By April 2013, people were using RapeBook to post pictures of women and pre-pubescent girls being raped or beaten. Some days, Hendren received more than 500 anonymous, explicitly violent comments—“I will skull-fuck your children,” for instance. Facebook users tracked down and posted her address, her children’s names, and her phone number and started to call her.

By that time, Hendren had abandoned any hope that using Facebook’s reporting mechanisms could help her. She was able, however, to work directly with a Facebook moderator to address the threats and criminal content. She found that the company sincerely wanted to help. Their representatives discussed the posts with her on a case-by-case basis, but more violent and threatening posts kept coming, and much of the content she considered graphic and abusive was allowed to remain.

Facebook’s people, she said, told her they didn’t consider the threats to her and her family credible or legitimate. Hendren, however, was concerned enough to contact the police and the FBI. The FBI started an investigation; meanwhile Hendren, physically and emotionally spent, suspended her Facebook account. “I was the sickest I have ever been,” she said. “It was really disgusting work. We just began to think, ‘Why are we devoting all our efforts on a volunteer basis to do work that Facebook—with billions of dollars—should be taking care of?’”

Hendren contacted Soraya, who continued to press Facebook directly. At the same time, Soraya and Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, also began comparing notes on what readers were sending them. Bates was struck by surprising ad placements. At the time, a photo captioned “The bitch didn’t know when to shut up” appeared alongside ads for Dove and iTunes. “Domestic Violence: Don’t Make Me Tell You Twice”—a page filled with photos of women beaten, bruised, and bleeding—was populated by ads for Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg’s new bestselling book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.

In early May, Bates decided to tweet at one of these companies. “Hi @Finnair here’s your ad on another domestic violence page—will you stop advertising with Facebook?” FinnAir responded immediately: “It is totally against our values and policies. Thanks @r2ph! @everydaysexism Could you send us the URL please so that we can take action?”

Soraya, Bates, and Jaclyn Friedman, the executive director of Women, Action, and Media, a media justice advocacy group, joined forces and launched a social media campaign designed to attract advertisers’ attention. The ultimate goal was to press Facebook to recognize explicit violence against women as a violation of its own prohibitions against hate speech, graphic violence, and harassment. Within a day of beginning the campaign, 160 organizations and corporations had co-signed a public letter, and in less than a week, more than 60,000 tweets were shared using the campaign’s #FBrape hashtag. Nissan was the first company to pull its advertising dollars from Facebook altogether. More than 15 others soon followed. The letter emphasized that Facebook’s refusal to take down content that glorified and trivialized graphic rape and domestic violence was actually hampering free expression—it was “marginaliz[ing] girls and women, sidelin[ing] our experiences and concerns, and contribut[ing] to violence against us.”

When Emily Bazelon, author of a book and a March 2013 Atlantic story about Internet bullies, visited Facebook’s headquarters, the young men she saw working as moderators were spending roughly 30 seconds assessing each reported post, millions of reports a week. Outsourced speech moderation has become a booming industry. Like Facebook’s own moderation process, the operations of these companies are opaque by design.

In late June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would hear the case of Anthony Elonis, a man with five charges of sexual harassment, who was imprisoned after threatening to kill his wife on Facebook. Elonis insists that his Facebook posts were not real threats but protected speech. Tara Elonis, his estranged wife—possibly aware that most female murder victims are killed by intimate partners—said that there was nothing unthreatening about her husband’s Facebook posts and that they forced her to take necessary, costly precautions. “If I only knew then what I know now,” read one, “I would have smothered your ass with a pillow, dumped your body in the back seat, dropped you off in Toad Creek, and made it look like a rape and murder.""

In late August 2016, Drew Curtis, founder of the content aggregator FARK, announced that the company had added “misogyny” to its moderation guidelines. FARK no longer allows rape jokes or threats. It also prohibited posts that call groups of women ""whores"" or ""sluts,"" or suggest that a woman who suffered a crime is somehow asking for it. In a note to readers, Curtis wrote, “This represents enough of a departure from pretty much how every other large Internet community operates that I figure an announcement is necessary.” Responding in Slate, Amanda Hess praised FARK’s new policy but also pointed out its limitations: Just underneath his announcement, users posted dozens of comments about rape, whores, and “boobies.”

811677710,"""Don't be ashamed of your story it will inspire others"" —Anita Kanitz

""You're not a victim for sharing your story. You are a survivor setting the world on fire with your truth. And you never know who needs your light, your warmth, and raging courage"" — Alex Elle

""We must send a message across the world that there is no disgrace in being a survivor of sexual violence. The shame is on the aggressor. ""– Angelina Jolie

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home for if a woman cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere.”
― Aysha Taryam

""Pornography is the instruction, rape the practice. Pornography shows evil lies about women and the sad truth about men.""
-Anita Kanitz

""Show me an abuse of women in society, I'll show it to you made sex in the pornography. If you want to know who is being hurt in this society, go see what is being done and to whom in pornography and then go look for them other places in the world. You will find them being hurt in just that way.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

""Pornography is used in rape - to plan it, to execute it, to choreograph it, to engender the excitement to commit the act."" [Andrea testimony before the New York Attorney General's Commission on Pornography in 1986]
-Andrea Dworkin

""If any male idiots send me dick pics, I should answer in their opinion, your penis is very personable, I want to get to know your dick. What is going on in the minds of these men, I tell them, nothing! They have a tail instead of a brain, sad but true!""
-Anita Kanitz

""If Pornography is part of your sexuality, then you have no right to your sexuality.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

"" Men, permitted to put words (and other things) in women's mouths, create scenes in which women desperately want to be bound, battered, tortured, humiliated, and killed.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

""Pornography is now beyond anyone’s control. It’s a classic example of ever-controversial unregulated capitalism — the market automatically responding to individual needs and desires. I continue to support and defend pornography, which I believe exposes the deepest, darkest truths about sexuality.""
-Camille Paglia

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”
― Sierra D. Waters, Debbie

“The rape of a child is a violent act of contempt, not an expression of sexuality or affection.”
― Mike Lew, Gay Men and Childhood Sexual Trauma

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 16 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

Armed Survivor/ Christine Hand-Gonzales Ed.D. (Author)
An honorable citizen, a disturbed criminal, and a lifelong addiction to violence, control, and sexual abuse, were on the agenda. ARMED SURVIVOR is the true account of two lives on a horrific collision course. The story is filled with twists and turns, intrigue and suspense. Violence against women has reached epic proportions in the United States. In this case, a 30-year veteran school counselor and single woman appeared to take all the right precautions to live alone “safely.” Smart, aware, and responsible, this independent lady possesses the survivor’s instinct, but did she have what it would take to battle this demon?Unbeknownst to her, this stalker would watched from a distance. He tracked her every move, day and night, weekdays and weekends for several months. Lurking in the dark, this predator, a Cuban national, planned his attack. Had he done this before? Was he seeking asylum and sanctuary in the United States to avoid jail time in Cuba for pending rape and murder charges? It will become apparent that this convicted felon and pathological liar did not fear extradition, our legal system, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or the Department of Homeland Security. Had he found refuge and protection in ""sanctuary cities?""Follow these two lives to understand how this freak encounter between two strangers occurred; then, learn how to protect yourself from such attacks.

I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced/Nujood Ali (Author)
“I’m a simple village girl who has always obeyed the orders of my father and brothers. Since forever, I have learned to say yes to everything. Today I have decided to say no.”
Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.
Hers is an unforgettable story of tragedy, triumph, and courage.

You Are Not Your Rape: an anthology /Tianna G Hansen (Editor)
In a time where the news tells tales of accused rape and those who speak out are ridiculed, sent death threats, shamed, made to feel unsafe... this project is all the more important and necessary. To provide a permanent home for those voices who refuse to stay silent, despite this. Despite the trauma we endure.
This is an influential time for us to speak out.
In this collection, you'll find over 100 voices - stories by and about sexual abuse and assault survivors, told in creative nonfiction, poems and flash.
We are survivors and there are many steps on this journey. Empowerment is a process. We honor every step, the fledgling ones and the dark hopelessness too.

“In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure no one listens.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“... in practice the standard for what constitutes rape is set not at the level of women's experience of violation but just above the level of coercion acceptable to men.”
― Judith Lewis Herman

""Pornography has been so thickly glossed over with the patina of chic these days in the name of verbal freedom and sophisication… Part of the problem is that those who traditionally have been the most vigorous opponents of porn are often those same people who shudder at the explicit mention of any sexual subject… There can be no equality in porn, no female equivalent, no turning of the tables in the name of bawdy fun. Pornography, like rape, is a male invention, desgined to dehumanize women… Pornography is the undiluted essence of anti-female propoganda.""
Susan Brownmiller

""Pornography is used in rape - to plan it, to execute it, to choreograph it, to engender the excitement to commit the act.""
Andrea Dworkin

The worldwide misogyny and contempt for women are expressed, above all, in sadistic pornography and forced prostitution worldwide in such an extreme form that we have to speak of sexual femicide and sexual terrorism for men.


Misogynist thinking and acting is everyday life in Germany. For example, every fourth woman and every second girl in Germany experiences beatings or rape.
Causes of misogyny are also male and female role models that are deeply anchored in society: men and boys should be tough and take what they want, women and girls should be sexy and available.
These role models supposedly provide orientation, but ultimately ""posing"" often prevents boys and girls / men and women from getting really close.
In the worst case, the unconscious replay of role models leads to violence against women, girls and female children because they are treated like objects.
Violence against women occurs in all social classes and groups. Specifically, in 2017 alone 114,000 acts of violence in partnerships were reported in which women were the victims. The number of unreported cases is very high. According to a Europe-wide study, only about 13 percent of women affected report serious incidents of violence to the police. Why is that? How is it that so many men do not regard women as equals and treat them disrespectfully?
Sexism, pornography and misogyny are ubiquitous around the world. E.g. when a group of guys talk about who ""cleared"" a girl. Because boys use it to express that they perceive girls as objects. ""Things"" that a man ""gets"", ""takes"" or ""belongs to"".
Many young women play this game, mostly unconsciously: by portraying themselves as a sexual object through outward appearances, including on social media, and by expecting the young man to take the first step and conquer them. And here you have to speak of a brainwashing of women by the media, society and politics. Because if female children, girls and women already feel worthless and let themselves be pushed into the role of sex dolls and birthing machines, why should men and boys still have respect for such objects that they consider completely worthless and see them as human beings?
There is toxic masculinity everywhere, which manifests itself in the so-called macho culture, rape culture, forced and child marriages, honor killings, acid assassinations, forced veiling, FGM, dowry and witch killings, the accusing, imprisoning, torturing and executing female victims, stoning is very popular here in Muslim countries for girls and women, in war, mass, group rape, sexual assault on the street, in school, university or at work, not to mention the very common domestic violence and sexual child abuse.
It is not optimistic about the horrific crimes and hate crimes against women around the world, mostly with impunity!
And anyone who wants to take refuge in music as a woman will be unpleasantly surprised:
In hip hop, men sing about how they make women ""clear"", feel superior to them, abuse them. All of this is sold as ""cool"" and often hits the charts. At the expense of women. A lot of porn has a similar dynamic: Here, too, male power fantasies are served. Even the porn actress Lena Nitro sees this critically: She demands a porn driver's license so that no one under 18 can watch porn films. In any case, porn gives a completely wrong picture of what ""normal sexuality"" is.
Porn scripts do not know equality! The biggest misogynists are clearly pornographers because they glorify violence, torture, humiliation, sexual femicide. That has nothing to do with normal sexuality!
Anyone who doesn't know each other well and cannot confidently say what he / she (does not) want comes under pressure from porn. Typical porn scripts are not about two people agreeing on an equal footing about what they enjoy. Rather, the man generally exercises power over the woman. He takes what he wants and she has to obey. Basically, both genders lose: women lose their dignity and both the freedom for feelings and the chance to be close.
What happens with pornography and re-enactment during intercourse is something like this: ""This is exactly what happens with porn, that it is not fun of equal value, but rather a 'I'm going off on her and taking my fun out of it'.""

There is also an understanding of hierarchy, for example that men are superior. Misogyny is used to secure male power and dominance in society.
Role patterns can be observed almost everywhere: in the school yard, in the disco, at public festivals. Here alcohol, crowds and wide-cut, short dirndls ensure that inhibitions fall. Where is the line between flirtation and assault? Are short dresses or large necklines an ""invitation to grope""? - A couple of men interviewed by moderator Ramo Ali tend to give it a try. And some even see a ""no"" as an occasion to become more persistent.
The women, in turn, report regular attacks: verbally and tangibly. As a female you almost have to expect that at an event like the Regensburg Maidult, a small ""Oktoberfest"". One of the women questioned is nevertheless outraged: Dressing sexy does not mean that she wants to be touched everywhere. Even when inhibitions are falling, men should know that ""just reaching out"" is taboo.
And they don't know that from my 65-year-old life experience. The so-called catcalling with often disgusting slogans and insults is familiar to every woman, every woman and every girl knows such slogans and such behavior at celebrations, parties and events, often enough it also happens at school, at university and at work. Even at home, women are not safe there, even in their own four walls and at family celebrations there is a lot to be heard and anyone who does not smile and join in here as a woman is considered abnormal and at best a brake on fun!
That is why it is damned important not to participate anymore as a woman and to say: Stop it, enough now, we are human beings and we want to be treated as such!
In courses for feminist self-assertion, women learn to build inner strength and clearly convey their limits: So far and no further! It starts with making them aware of their limits. Then they mentally act out dangerous situations: What to do if steps approach from behind in the dark? Anna Pytlak has had traumatic experiences. The very thought of the steps from behind triggers a panic attack in her. Other participants react less dramatically. However, many find it difficult to act loudly and decisively at the crucial moment instead of becoming silent and rigid. But this determination can be trained.

Learning to assert yourself can empower women individually. But in order to really fight misogyny, other role models are needed across society.
Unfortunately there are damned many forms of sexual violence and sexual violence has not decreased, no increased, because we live in the thought of pseudo-equality that does not exist worldwide. The men still have the real say, they just want to make us believe that this is not the case and that if we feel that way, we should urgently see a psychiatrist:

Forms of (sexual) violence against women:

In music videos or pornographic films, women often become mere objects: a ""thing"" that men can use. Women and girls are denied a right to self-determination.
""Victim blaming"" happens frequently: women are persuaded that it is their own fault that they have been the victim of an assault. For example because they were wearing a mini skirt.
Femicide means: women are killed because they are women. For example, because they had sex or were raped before marriage. The perpetrators, mostly from the family, call this ""honor killing"".
Women are also victims of digital violence on the Internet. Women are regularly victims of digital stalking by their exes.

What equality really looks like can be observed every day by women around the world from the sexual cyberstalking, the sexual online terror and the misogynistic online haters, it is a modern sexual witch hunt that takes place without exception on all women, the pornography of all society has lowered the inhibition threshold damn well!
Our society lays the roots for sexism and misogyny early on, for example with role models. It takes a lot of (self) awareness and a lot of conversations between men and women to get more understanding and respect for one another. In this way, ""toxic"" masculinity and violence against women can be reduced step by step. But that can only happen if paid rape in the worst and sadistic form such as pornography and prostitution is finally abolished worldwide and permanently. We women neither need prostitution nor pornography nor men in this world who claim that they cannot live without it.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0

Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter and his very bad misogynist friends.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k. The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.
The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Women fight back, because only then can you finally put an end to this indescribable misery.

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Tears of the Silenced: An Amish True Crime Memoir of Childhood Sexual Abuse, Brutal Betrayal, and Ultimate Survival/Misty Griffin (Autor)
When Misty Griffin was six years old, her family started to live and dress like the Amish. Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their stepfather kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care.
When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. After she escaped and reported the bishop, she found herself alone in a modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card.
Misty has a message for abuse survivors: “Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken. This is my story of survival and moving past the abuse to embrace my dreams.” In June 2019 Misty graduated nursing school. She continues to work to raise awareness about child abuse and sexual assault.

Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims and imparts a wisdom profoundly hard-won: “You save yourself or you remain unsaved.” Now reissued with a new afterword by the author, her story remains as urgent as it was when it was first published eighteen years ago.",0,0,Event,23536379,0,comment,2021-04-22 11:38:26+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],warner-brothers-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2,warner-brothers-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2_limit_1,for

817111174,"Change culture so that women can say they're victims of domestic abuse. Those saying they're victims while attacking Amber are fake...

Maybe I didn't get beat up or sexually abused physically, but I could have been. Then it's so scary to ever say that because it's silenced and retaliated. Women cannot just leave their homes or get away from abusers. Abusers continue to harm women even when they put distance between them. It's happening right now with Amber's example too.
Men often are richer, then they use this power and leverage to harm women that 'leave' them AND their children, such as myself. The stalking, the phone calls of breathing, this and that. Now, Depp can harm Amber the same way, but using others since he's rich enough.
Now, they want to invalidate 12 times of domestic violence?! Really?! When we see this, how many more years will it be in the United States until people like myself can ever say we were victims? When I see this, how can I say I'm a victim or others? Because harassment didn't lead to violence when it could have because we avoided it?

Amber Heard is a victim and it's so great that she spoke out. I know there's fear in saying that, but I definitely call her a victim as a 3rd party. She went through extreme violence.

816731165,"""Remember, we were all born with wings. In times of doubt spread them. ""
-Anita Kanitz

“Every woman is a sister of another woman born within or outside her race. Women have the power to unite the world for they have one link to the universe--their caring and loving hearts.”
― Princess Maleiha Bajunaid Candao

Never any doubt that a group of thoughtful, brave and strong women and girls can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. We women and girls are strong and can change the world to a better one because without us it will not work! It must be our ultimate goal that female babies, children, girls and women can live fearless, free and self-determined anywhere in the world. It can not be that in the 21st century, men continue to have the power about their lives, their bodies, their freedom, their education, their occupation,their birth control. It can not be that girls and women are still being talked worldwide by brainwashing, they are only happy with men and daily intercourses in their lives. The media report daily where the whole thing leads to femicide, infanticides, domestic and sexual violence, rape culture, mass, gang and war rapes, misogyny, FGM, forced and child marriages, forced prostitution, trafficking in women and girls, sexual slavery, acid attacks, honor killings, dowry murders, widow murders, witch hunts, sex murders, domestic murders, sexual and sadistic stalking, slavery, forced veiling, catcalling, sexual harassment, hate speech and persecution in the name of all men made religions, verbal violence, hate speech and sexism in the society and media, , victim blaming, lynching, lashing, executions (stoning and burning alive) and imprisonment of female victims, even childs, to the compulsion to marry, to have sexual intercourse, to give birth to children, to give up because of men on education and occupation.

Unfortunately, for 17 years, I have been affected by cyberstalking, cyberbullying, identity theft on the internet, hate speech and defamation on the social medial, constant hacker attacks. The culprit is a former psychopathic and women-hating islamic tenant and all his friends, relatives and acquaintances. These people make a sport of chasing and harassing women and girls on the Internet. My female friends, acquaintances and colleagues were also affected. I was obviously also sent real rape pornos, sadistic BDSM porn and rape threats and death threats. These people must finally get long prison sentences in jail. It can not be that such heinous criminals are allowed to continue.

The mirror of the situation worldwide: The misogyny on the Social Media:

The Unsafety Net: How Social Media Turned Against Women

Under the banner of free speech, companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been host to rape videos and revenge porn—which makes female users feel anything but free!!!

In December 2012, an Icelandic woman named Thorlaug Agustsdottir discovered a Facebook group called “Men are better than women.” One image she found there, Thorlaug wrote to us this summer in an email, “was of a young woman naked chained to pipes or an oven in what looked like a concrete basement, all bruised and bloody. She looked with a horrible broken look at whoever was taking the pic of her curled up naked.” Thorlaug wrote an outraged post about it on her own Facebook page.
Before long, a user at “Men are better than women” posted an image of Thorlaug’s face, altered to appear bloody and bruised. Under the image, someone commented, “Women are like grass, they need to be beaten/cut regularly.” Another wrote: “You just need to be raped.” Thorlaug reported the image and comments to Facebook and requested that the site remove them.

“We reviewed the photo you reported,” came Facebook’s auto reply, “but found it does not violate Facebook’s Community Standards on hate speech, which includes posts or photos that attack a person based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition.”

Instead, the Facebook screeners labeled the content “Controversial Humor.” Thorlaug saw nothing funny about it. She worried the threats were real.
Some 50 other users sent their own requests on her behalf. All received the same reply. Eventually, on New Year’s Eve, Thorlaug called the local press, and the story spread from there. Only then was the image removed.

In January 2013, Wired published a critical account of Facebook’s response to these complaints. A company spokesman contacted the publication immediately to explain that Facebook screeners had mishandled the case, conceding that Thorlaug’s photo “should have been taken down when it was reported to us.” According to the spokesman, the company tries to address complaints about images on a case-by-case basis within 72 hours, but with millions of reports to review every day, “it’s not easy to keep up with requests.” The spokesman, anonymous to Wired readers, added, “We apologize for the mistake.”
If, as the communications philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously said, television brought the brutality of war into people’s living rooms, the Internet today is bringing violence against women out of it. Once largely hidden from view, this brutality is now being exposed in unprecedented ways. In the words of Anne Collier, co-director of ConnectSafely.org and co-chair of the Obama administration’s Online Safety and Technology Working Group, “We are in the middle of a global free speech experiment.” On the one hand, these online images and words are bringing awareness to a longstanding problem. On the other hand, the amplification of these ideas over social media networks is validating and spreading pathology.

In other words, social media is more symptom than disease: A 2013 report from the World Health Organization called violence against women “a global health problem of epidemic proportion,” from domestic abuse, stalking, and street harassment to sex trafficking, rape, and murder. This epidemic is thriving in the petri dish of social media.

While some of the aggression against women online occurs between people who know one another, and is unquestionably illegal, most of it happens between strangers. Earlier this year, Pacific Standard published a long story by Amanda Hess about an online stalker who set up a Twitter account specifically to send her death threats.

Across websites and social media platforms, everyday sexist comments exist along a spectrum that also includes illicit sexual surveillance, “creepshots,” extortion, doxxing, stalking, malicious impersonation, threats, and rape videos and photographs. The explosive use of the Internet to conduct human trafficking also has a place on this spectrum, given that three-quarters of trafficked people are girls and women.

A report, “Misogyny on Twitter,” released by the research and policy organization Demos this June, found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter between December 26, 2013, and February 9, 2014. (The words “bitch” and “cunt” were not measured.) An estimated 20 percent of the misogyny study Tweets appeared, to researchers, to be threatening. An example: ""@XXX @XXX You stupid ugly fucking slut I’ll go to your flat and cut your fucking head off you inbred whore.""

In summer 2016, VidCon, an annual nationwide convention held in Southern California, women vloggers shared an astonishing number of examples. The violent threats posted beneath YouTube videos, they observed, are pushing women off of this and other platforms in disproportionate numbers. When Anita Sarkeesian launched a Kickstarter to help fund a feminist video series called Tropes vs. Women, she became the focus of a massive and violently misogynistic cybermob. Among the many forms of harassment she endured was a game where thousands of players “won” by virtually bludgeoning her face. In late August, she contacted the police and had to leave her home after she received a series of serious violent online threats.

Danielle Keats Citron, law professor at the University of Maryland and author of the recently released book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, explained, “Time and time again, these women have no idea often who it is attacking them. A cybermob jumps on board, and one can imagine that the only thing the attackers know about the victim is that she’s female.” Looking at 1,606 cases of “revenge porn,” where explicit photographs are distributed without consent, Citron found that 90 percent of targets were women. Another study she cited found that 70 percent of female gamers chose to play as male characters rather than contend with sexual harassment.

This type of harassment also fills the comment sections of popular websites. In August 2016, employees of the largely female-staffed website Jezebel published an open letter to the site’s parent company, Gawker, detailing the professional, physical, and emotional costs of having to look at the pornographic GIFs maliciously populating the site’s comments sections everyday. “It’s like playing whack-a-mole with a sociopathic Hydra,” they wrote, insisting that Gawker develop tools for blocking and tracking IP addresses. They added, “It’s impacting our ability to do our jobs.”

For some, the costs are higher. In 2010, 12-year-old Amanda Todd bared her chest while chatting online with a person who’d assured her that he was a boy, but was in fact a grown man with a history of pedophilia. For the next two years, Amanda and her mother, Carol Todd, were unable to stop anonymous users from posting that image on sexually explicit pages. A Facebook page, labeled “Controversial Humor,” used Amanda’s name and image—and the names and images of other girls—without consent. In October 2012, Amanda committed suicide, posting a YouTube video that explained her harassment and her decision. In April 2014, Dutch officials announced that they had arrested a 35-year-old man suspected to have used the Internet to extort dozens of girls, including Amanda, in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The suspect now faces charges of child pornography, extortion, criminal harassment, and Internet luring.

Almost immediately after Amanda shared her original image, altered versions appeared on pages, and videos proliferated. One of the pages was filled with pictures of naked pre-pubescent girls, encouraging them to drink bleach and die. While she appreciates the many online tributes honoring her daughter, Carol Todd is haunted by “suicide humor” and pornographic content now forever linked to her daughter’s image. There are web pages dedicated to what is now called “Todding.” One of them features a photograph of a young woman hanging.

Meanwhile, extortion of other victims continues. In an increasing number of countries, rapists are now filming their rapes on cell phones so they can blackmail victims out of reporting the crimes. In August, after a 16-year-old Indian girl was gang-raped, she explained, “I was afraid. While I was being raped, another man pointed a gun and recorded me with his cellphone camera. He said he will upload the film on the Net if I tell my family or the police.”

In Pakistan, the group Bytes for All—an organization that previously sued the government for censoring YouTube videos—released a study showing that social media and mobile tech are causing real harm to women in the country. Gul Bukhari, the report’s author, told Reuters, “These technologies are helping to increase violence against women, not just mirroring it.”

In June 2014, a 16-year-old girl named Jada was drugged and raped at a party in Texas. Partygoers posted a photo of her lying unconscious, one leg bent back. Soon, other Internet users had turned it into a meme, mocking her pose and using the hashtag #jadapose. Kasari Govender, executive director of the Vancouver-based West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), calls this kind of behavior “cybermisogyny.” “Cyberbullying,” she says, “has become this term that’s often thrown around with little understanding. We think it’s important to name the forces that are motivating this in order to figure out how to address it.”

In an unusually bold act, Jada responded by speaking publicly about her rape and the online abuse that followed. Supporters soon took to the Internet in her defense. “There’s no point in hiding,” she told a television reporter. “Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but that’s not what I am and who I am. I’m just angry.”

After Facebook removed Thorlaug’s altered image and the rape threats, she felt relieved, but she was angry too. “These errors are going to manifest again,” she told Wired, “if there isn’t clear enough policy.”

Yet, at the time of Thorlaug’s report, Facebook did have a clear policy. Its detailed Community Standards for speech, often considered the industry’s gold standard, were bolstered by reporting tools that allowed users to report offensive content, and Thorlaug had used these tools as instructed. But serious errors were still manifesting regularly.

Not long after Thorlaug’s struggle to remove her image, a Facebook user posted a video documenting the gang rape of a woman by the side of a road in Malaysia. The six minutes of graphic footage were live for more than three weeks, during which Facebook moderators declined repeated requests for removal.

Around the same time, another Icelandic woman, Hildur Lilliendahl Viggósdóttir, decided to draw attention to similar problems by creating a page called “Men who hate women,” where she reposted examples of misogyny she found elsewhere on Facebook. Her page was suspended four times—not because of its offensive content, but because she was reposting images without written permission. Meanwhile, the original postings—graphically depicting rape and glorifying the physical abuse of women—remained on Facebook. As activists had been noting for years, pages like these were allowed by Facebook to remain under the category of “humor.” Other humorous pages live at the time had names like “I kill bitches like you,” “Domestic Violence: Don’t Make Me Tell You Twice,” “I Love the Rape Van,” and “Raping Babies Because You’re Fucking Fearless.”

For online harassers, this is often an overt goal: to silence female community members, whether through sexual slurs or outright threats. It’s little surprise that the Internet has become a powerful tool in intimate partner violence: A 2012 survey conducted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) found that 89 percent of local domestic violence programs reported victims who were experiencing technology-enabled abuse, often across multiple platforms.

For their part, social media companies often express commitment to user safety, but downplay their influence on the broader culture. Administrators repeatedly explain that their companies, while very concerned with protecting users, are not in the business of policing free speech. As Twitter co-founder Biz Stone phrased it in a post titled “Tweets Must Flow,” “We strive not to remove Tweets on the basis of their content.” The company’s guidelines encourage readers to unfollow the offensive party and “express your feelings [to a trusted friend] so you can move on.”

None of this was of much help to Caroline Criado-Perez, a British journalist and feminist who helped get a picture of Jane Austen on the £10 banknote. The day Bank of England made the announcement, Criado-Perez began receiving more than 50 violent threats per hour on Twitter. “The immediate impact was that I couldn’t eat or sleep,” she told The Guardian in 2013. She asked Twitter to find some way to stop the threats, but at the time the company offered no mechanism for reporting abuse. Since then, the company has released a reporting button, but its usefulness is extremely limited: It requires that every tweet be reported separately, a cumbersome process that gives the user no way of explaining that she is a target of ongoing harassment. (The system currently provides no field for comments.)

For that reasons, when social media companies fail to respond to complaints and requests, victims of online harassment frequently turn to individuals who can publicize their cases. Trista Hendren, an Oregon-based blogger, became an advocate for other women after readers from Iceland, Egypt, Australia, India, Lebanon, and the UK began asking her to write about their experiences. “I was overwhelmed,” she told us. In December 2012, Hendren and several collaborators created a Facebook page called RapeBook where users could flag and report offensive content that the company had refused to take down.

By April 2013, people were using RapeBook to post pictures of women and pre-pubescent girls being raped or beaten. Some days, Hendren received more than 500 anonymous, explicitly violent comments—“I will skull-fuck your children,” for instance. Facebook users tracked down and posted her address, her children’s names, and her phone number and started to call her.

By that time, Hendren had abandoned any hope that using Facebook’s reporting mechanisms could help her. She was able, however, to work directly with a Facebook moderator to address the threats and criminal content. She found that the company sincerely wanted to help. Their representatives discussed the posts with her on a case-by-case basis, but more violent and threatening posts kept coming, and much of the content she considered graphic and abusive was allowed to remain.

Facebook’s people, she said, told her they didn’t consider the threats to her and her family credible or legitimate. Hendren, however, was concerned enough to contact the police and the FBI. The FBI started an investigation; meanwhile Hendren, physically and emotionally spent, suspended her Facebook account. “I was the sickest I have ever been,” she said. “It was really disgusting work. We just began to think, ‘Why are we devoting all our efforts on a volunteer basis to do work that Facebook—with billions of dollars—should be taking care of?’”

Hendren contacted Soraya, who continued to press Facebook directly. At the same time, Soraya and Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, also began comparing notes on what readers were sending them. Bates was struck by surprising ad placements. At the time, a photo captioned “The bitch didn’t know when to shut up” appeared alongside ads for Dove and iTunes. “Domestic Violence: Don’t Make Me Tell You Twice”—a page filled with photos of women beaten, bruised, and bleeding—was populated by ads for Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg’s new bestselling book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.

In early May, Bates decided to tweet at one of these companies. “Hi @Finnair here’s your ad on another domestic violence page—will you stop advertising with Facebook?” FinnAir responded immediately: “It is totally against our values and policies. Thanks @r2ph! @everydaysexism Could you send us the URL please so that we can take action?”

Soraya, Bates, and Jaclyn Friedman, the executive director of Women, Action, and Media, a media justice advocacy group, joined forces and launched a social media campaign designed to attract advertisers’ attention. The ultimate goal was to press Facebook to recognize explicit violence against women as a violation of its own prohibitions against hate speech, graphic violence, and harassment. Within a day of beginning the campaign, 160 organizations and corporations had co-signed a public letter, and in less than a week, more than 60,000 tweets were shared using the campaign’s #FBrape hashtag. Nissan was the first company to pull its advertising dollars from Facebook altogether. More than 15 others soon followed. The letter emphasized that Facebook’s refusal to take down content that glorified and trivialized graphic rape and domestic violence was actually hampering free expression—it was “marginaliz[ing] girls and women, sidelin[ing] our experiences and concerns, and contribut[ing] to violence against us.”

When Emily Bazelon, author of a book and a March 2013 Atlantic story about Internet bullies, visited Facebook’s headquarters, the young men she saw working as moderators were spending roughly 30 seconds assessing each reported post, millions of reports a week. Outsourced speech moderation has become a booming industry. Like Facebook’s own moderation process, the operations of these companies are opaque by design.

In late June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would hear the case of Anthony Elonis, a man with five charges of sexual harassment, who was imprisoned after threatening to kill his wife on Facebook. Elonis insists that his Facebook posts were not real threats but protected speech. Tara Elonis, his estranged wife—possibly aware that most female murder victims are killed by intimate partners—said that there was nothing unthreatening about her husband’s Facebook posts and that they forced her to take necessary, costly precautions. “If I only knew then what I know now,” read one, “I would have smothered your ass with a pillow, dumped your body in the back seat, dropped you off in Toad Creek, and made it look like a rape and murder.""

In late August 2016, Drew Curtis, founder of the content aggregator FARK, announced that the company had added “misogyny” to its moderation guidelines. FARK no longer allows rape jokes or threats. It also prohibited posts that call groups of women ""whores"" or ""sluts,"" or suggest that a woman who suffered a crime is somehow asking for it. In a note to readers, Curtis wrote, “This represents enough of a departure from pretty much how every other large Internet community operates that I figure an announcement is necessary.” Responding in Slate, Amanda Hess praised FARK’s new policy but also pointed out its limitations: Just underneath his announcement, users posted dozens of comments about rape, whores, and “boobies.”

Gender Apartheid and sexist racism against females in Islam:
Picture a woman in the Middle East, and probably the first thing that comes into your mind will be the hijab. You might not even envision a face, just the black shroud of the burqa or the niqab. Women's rights in the mostly Arab countries of the region are among the worst in the world, but it's more than that. As Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy writes in a provocative cover story for Foreign Policy, misogyny has become so endemic to Arab societies that it's not just a war on women, it's a destructive force tearing apart Arab economies and societies. But why? How did misogyny become so deeply ingrained in the Arab world? 
 As Maya Mikdashi once wrote, ""Gender is not the study of what is evident, it is an analysis of how what is evident came to be."" That's a much tougher task than cataloging the awful and often socially accepted abuses of women in the Arab world. But they both matter, and Eltahawy's lengthy article on the former might reveal more of the latter than she meant.

There are two general ways to think about the problem of misogyny in the Arab world. The first is to think of it as an Arab problem, an issue of what Arab societies and people are doing wrong. ""We have no freedoms because they hate us,"" Eltahawy writes, the first of many times she uses ""they"" in a sweeping indictment of the cultures spanning from Morocco to the Arabian Peninsula. ""Yes: They hate us. It must be said."" 
Some of the most important architects of institutionalized Arab misogyny weren't actually Arab. They were Turkish -- or, as they called themselves at the time, Ottoman -- British, and French. These foreigners ruled Arabs for centuries, twisting the cultures to accommodate their dominance. One of their favorite tricks was to buy the submission of men by offering them absolute power over women. The foreign overlords ruled the public sphere, local men ruled the private sphere, and women got nothing; academic Deniz Kandiyoti called this the ""patriarchal bargain."" Colonial powers employed it in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and in South Asia, promoting misogynist ideas and misogynist men who might have otherwise stayed on the margins, slowly but surely ingraining these ideas into the societies.

Of course, those first seeds of misogyny had to come from somewhere. The evolutionary explanations are controversial. Some say that it's simply because men are bigger and could fight their way to dominance; some that men seek to control women, and particularly female sexuality, out of a subconscious fear being of cuckolded and raising another man's child; others that the rise of the nation-state promoted the role of warfare in society, which meant the physically stronger gender took on more power. You don't hear these, or any of the other evolutionary theories, cited much. What you do hear cited is religion. 
Like Christianity, Islam is an expansive and living religion. It has moved with the currents of history, and its billion-plus practitioners bring a wide spectrum of interpretations and beliefs. The colonial rulers who conquered Muslim societies were skilled at pulling out the slightest justification for their ""patriarchal bargain."" They promoted the religious leaders who were willing to take this bargain and suppressed those who objected. This is a big part of how misogynistic practices became especially common in the Muslim world (another reason is that, when the West later promoted secular rulers, anti-colonialists adopted extreme religious interpretations as a way to oppose them). ""They enshrined their gentleman's agreement in the realm of the sacred by elevating their religious family laws to state laws,"" anthropologist Suad Joseph wrote in her 2000 book, Gender and Citizenship in the Middle East. ""Women and children were the inevitable chips with which the political and religious leaders bargained."" Some misogynist practices predated colonialism. But many of those, for example female genital mutilation, also predated Islam. 

In Arab and Islamic countries, domestic violence is not yet considered a major concern despite its increasing frequency and serious consequences. Surveys in Egypt, Palestine, Israel and Tunisia show that at least one out of three women is beaten by her husband. The indifference to this type of violence stems from attitudes that domestic violence is a private matter and, usually, a justifiable response to misbehaviour on the part of the wife. Selective excerpts from the Koran are used to prove that men who beat their wives are following God's commandments. These religious justifications, plus the importance of preserving the honour of the family, lead abusers, victims, police and health care professionals to join in a conspiracy of silence rather than disclosing these offences. However, a fair reading of the Koran shows that wife abuse, like genital mutilation and ""honour killings"" are a result of culture rather than religion. 

There are many hate crimes against females in islam:

Mass sexual assault is the collective sexual assault of women, and sometimes children, in public by groups of men. Typically acting under the protective cover of large gatherings, victims have reported being groped, stripped, beaten, bitten, penetrated and raped.
In Egypt, several mass sexual assaults have received wide international coverage.n Arabic, the term ""mass sexual assaults"" translates as taharrush gamea"" following a German police report into the 2015/2016 New Year's Eve sexual assaults done by thousands of muslims in Germany.
British television presenter Saira Khan said in 2016 that she had been sexually assaulted by a crowd in Pakistan in 2007 while filming a documentary for the BBC. She accused the BBC of having ignored the attack.
Female participants at We Are Sthlm, a summer music festival for teenagers in Stockholm, reported in 2014 and 2015 that they had been surrounded and molested by groups of males, mostly teenage boys. Police were accused of having failed to publicize the attacks because the suspects were mostly from Afghanistan. The incidents came to light only after the 2016 New Year's Eve attacks in Germany when the Stockholm Police were accused of covering up the incidents, which they denied.

Stoning, or lapidation, is a method of capital punishment where a group throws stones at a person until the subject dies from blunt trauma. It has been attested as a form of punishment for grave misdeeds since ancient times. Its adoption in some legal systems has caused controversy in recent decades. 
In recent times, stoning has been a legal or customary punishment in Iran, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Qatar, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, northern Nigeria, Afghanistan, Brunei, and tribal parts of Pakistan, including northwest Kurram Valley and the northwest Khwezai-Baezai region.
In some other countries, including Nigeria and Pakistan, although stoning is a legal form of punishment, it has never been legally carried out. Stoning is condemned by human rights organizations and stoning sentences have sparked international controversies. Punishing adultery with stoning has varying levels of public support in the Muslim world, ranging from 86% of Muslims in Pakistan to 6% of Muslims in Albania and Bosnia. 
Legal stoning sentences have been reported in Saudi Arabia.
There were four cases of execution by stoning reported between 1981 and 1992.
In May 2012, a Sudanese court convicted Intisar Sharif Abdallah of adultery and sentenced her to death; the charges were appealed and dropped two months later.
In July 2012, a criminal court in Khartoum, Sudan, sentenced 23-year-old Layla Ibrahim Issa Jumul to death by stoning for adultery.
Amnesty International reported that she was denied legal counsel during the trial and was convicted only on the basis of her confession. The organization designated her a prisoner of conscience, ""held in detention solely for consensual sexual relations"", and lobbied for her release
In October 2008, a girl, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was buried up to her neck at a Somalian football stadium, then stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to adultery in a sharia court in Kismayo, a city that was controlled by Islamist insurgents. According to the insurgents she had stated that she wanted sharia law to apply.However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, had begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground.
Amnesty International later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by al-Shabab militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.
In September 2014, Somali al Shabaab militants stoned a woman to death, after she was declared guilty of adultery by an informal court.
Stoning is a legal form of judicial punishment in UAE. In 2006, an expatriate was sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery.
Between 2009 and 2013, several people were sentenced to death by stoning.
In May 2014, an Asian housemaid was sentenced to death by stoning in Abu Dhabi.

An honor killing (American English), honour killing (Commonwealth English), or a shame killing,is the murder of a member of a family, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family, or has violated the principles of a community or a religion with an honor culture. Typical reasons include divorcing or separating from their spouse, refusing to enter an arranged, child or forced marriage, being in a relationship or having associations with social groups outside the family that is strongly disapproved by one's family, having premarital or extramarital sex, becoming the victim of rape or sexual assault, dressing in clothing, jewelry and accessories which are deemed inappropriate, and engaging in non-heterosexual relations.Honor killing is a type of domestic violence in the broadest sense of violence within a family (not limited to intimate partner violence, which is another common meaning of the term). The justice systems of some countries, whether by explicit provisions or by lack of enforcement of existing laws, either does not prosecute or dispense reduced penalties for killings committed in the name of family honor. Some jurisdictions have more lenient penalties for crimes of passion committed without premeditation (such as murder immediately upon discovery of adultery), or explicitly have reduced penalties for a husband who kills a cheating wife (but not necessarily the reverse).
The concept of family honor is extremely important in many communities worldwide. The UN estimates that 5,000 women and girls are murdered each year in honor killings, which are widely reported in the Middle East and South Asia, but they occur in countries as varied as Brazil, Canada, Iran, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Egypt, Sweden, Syria, Uganda, United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries.
According to a study investigating 67 honor killings in Europe 1989-2009 by psychologist Phyllis Chesler, published in the non-peer reviewed Middle East Quarterly journal, 96% of honor murder perpetrators in Europe were Muslim and 68% of victims were tortured before they died.
Honor-based violence has a long tradition in Albania, and although it is much rarer today than it was in the past, it still exists.
The Kanun is a set of traditional Albanian laws and customs. Honor (in Albanian: Nderi) is one of the four pillars on which the Kanun is based. Honor crimes happen, especially in northern Albania. In Albania (and in other parts of the Balkans) the phenomenon of blood feuds between males was more common historically than honor killings of females, but honor-based violence against women and girls also has a tradition.
Ghazala Khan was shot and killed in Denmark in September 2005, by her brother, after she had married against the will of the family. She was of Pakistani origin. Her murder was ordered by her father to save her family's 'honor' and several relatives were involved. Sentences considered harsh by Danish standards were handed out to all nine accused members of her family and permanent banishment was ordered for those who were not Danish citizens. 
The 26-year-old Iraqi Kurdish woman Fadime Şahindal was killed by her father in 2002 in Uppsala in Sweden.
Kurdish organizations were criticized by prime minister Göran Persson for not doing enough to prevent honor killings.
 Pela Atroshi was a Kurdish girl who was shot by her uncle in an honor killing in Iraqi Kurdistan.
The murder of Pela and Fadime gave rise to the formation of GAPF (the acronym stands for Never Forget Pela and Fadime), a politically and religiously independent and secular nonprofit organization working against honor-related violence and oppression. The organization's name is taken from Pela Atroshi and Fadime Şahindal which are Sweden's best-known and high-profile cases of honor killings.
Banaz Mahmod, a 20-year-old Iraqi Kurdish woman from Mitcham, south London, was killed in 2006, in a murder orchestrated by her father, uncle and cousins. Gangraped, tortured and murdered in a evil kind.Her life and murder were presented in a documentary called Banaz: A Love Story, directed and produced by Deeyah Khan. The investigation into her disappearance and murder was dramatised in the 2020, two-part ITV mini-series, Honour, starring Keeley Hawes.
As many as 133 women were killed in the Iraqi city of Basra alone in 2006. Seventy-nine were killed for violation of ""Islamic teachings"" and 47 for honor, according to IRIN, the news branch of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Amnesty International says that armed groups, not the government, also kill politically active women and those who did not follow a strict dress code, as well as women who are perceived as human rights defenders.
In 2008 a woman was killed in Saudi Arabia by her father for ""chatting"" with a man on Facebook. The killing became public only when a Saudi cleric referred to the case, to criticize Facebook for the strife it caused.
A report compiled by the Council of Europe estimated that over 200 women were killed in honor killings in Turkey in 2007.
A June 2008 report by the Turkish Prime Ministry's Human Rights Directorate said that in Istanbul alone there was one honor killing every week, and reported over 1,000 during the previous five years. It added that metropolitan cities were the location of many of these, due to growing immigration to these cities from the East.
In 2010 a 16-year-old girl was buried alive by relatives for befriending boys in Southeast Turkey; her corpse was found 40 days after she went missing.
In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honor killings, but the total number is believed to be much higher. Of the reported honor killings, 21% were committed by the victims' husbands, 7% by their brothers, 4% by their fathers, and the rest by other relatives.

Child marriage is a marriage or similar union, formal or informal, between a child and an adult or another child under a certain age, typically age eighteen.[1] The vast majority of child marriages are between a girl and a man,and are rooted in gender inequality.
According to UNICEF, Africa has the highest incidence rates of child marriage, with over 50% of girls marrying under the age of eighteen in five nations.[22] Girls in West and Central Africa have the highest risk of marrying in childhood. Niger has one of the highest rates of early marriage in sub-Saharan Africa. Among Nigerien women between the ages of twenty and twenty-four, 76% reported marrying before the age of eighteen and 28% reported marrying before the age of fifteen.
In parts of Ethiopia and Nigeria many girls are married before the age of 15, some as young as 7.In parts of Mali 39% of girls are married before the age of 15. In Niger and Chad, over 70% of girls are married before the age of 18.
Child marriage rates in Bangladesh are amongst the highest in the world.
very 2 out of 3 marriages involve child marriages. According to statistics from 2005, 49% of women then between 25 and 29 were married by the age of 15 in Bangladesh.Another study found that women who married at age 18 or older were less likely to experience IPV (intimate partner violence) than those married before age 18. It also found that girls married before age 15 were at an even higher risk for IPV.
According to two 2013 reports, over 50% of all marriages in Pakistan involve girls less than 18 years old.
Married teenage girls with low levels of education suffer greater risk of social isolation and domestic violence than more educated women who marry as adults.
Child marriage is always forced marriage.
Forced marriage is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without their consent or against their will. A marriage can also become a forced marriage even if both parties enter with full consent if one or both are later forced to stay in the marriage against their will.
Forced Marriage Unit campaign July 2012 (7555353844)

A forced marriage differs from an arranged marriage, in which both parties presumably consent to the assistance of their parents or a third party such as a matchmaker in finding and choosing a spouse. There is often a continuum of coercion used to compel a marriage, ranging from outright physical violence to subtle psychological pressure.[1] Though now widely condemned by international opinion, forced marriages still take place in various cultures across the world, particularly in parts of South Asia and Africa. Some scholars object to use of the term ""forced marriage"" because it invokes the consensual legitimating language of marriage (such as husband/wife) for an experience that is precisely the opposite.
In 2009, the Special Court for Sierra Leone's (SCSL) Appeals Chamber found the abduction and confinement of women for ""forced marriage"" in war to be a new crime against humanity (AFRC decision).
The SCSL Trial Chamber in the Charles Taylor decision found that the term 'forced marriage' should be avoided and rather described the practice in war as 'conjugal slavery' (2012).
Forced marriage is common in Niger. Niger has the highest prevalence of child marriage in the world.and also the highest total fertility rate,
Girls who attempt to leave forced marriages are most often rejected by their families and are often forced to enter prostitution in order to survive.Balkissa Chaibou is known as one of the most famous activists against forced marriage in Niger. Chaibou was 12 when she was informed by her own mother that she was to be married to her cousin, and when she was 16, she took to the courts. With little success, Chaibou was forced to a women's shelter before she was finally able to go home where she learned of her parents changed views on forced marriage, that they were now against it
The ""Sexual Intercourse Related Crimes Bill"" proposed in August 2020 would allow both child marriage and forced marriage. The new bill “risks legitimizing child marriage, among other alarming practices,” U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said. Thousands of people in Somalia circulated a petition against the bill, including representatives of the Mogadishu-based Elman Peace and Human Rights Center. More than 45% of young women in Somalia marry or are “in union” before age 18.
Forced marriage remains common for Kurdish girls in Iran and is also one of the major reasons for self-immolation in Iran.
 In 1998, UNICEF reported high rates of forced marriage in Iranian Kurdistan, including at an early age, but also reported that the practice was declining.[102] Kurdish cultural norms which facilitate the practice of forced and child marriage perpetuate the fear of violence amongst Kurdish girls in Iran.

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision,[a] is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widespread in Egypt, with a majority of women having undergone some version of the procedure,[40] although the practice is less common among the youth.[41] The practice is deeply ingrained in the culture and predates both Christianity and Islam. Its main purpose is to preserve chastity, though its social function is very complicated. FGM was banned in 2008, but enforcement of the law was weak.Women continued to face inadequate protection from sexual and gender-based violence, as well as gender discrimination in law and practice, particularly under personal status laws regulating divorce. A 17-year-old girl died on 29 May, reportedly from hemorrhaging, following female genital mutilation (FGM) at a private hospital in Suez Governorate. Four people faced trial on charges of causing lethal injury and FGM, including the girl's mother and medical staff as per Amnesty 2016/2017 report.
Female genital cutting (also known as female genital mutilation) in Nigeria accounts for the most female genital cutting/mutilation (FGM/C) cases worldwide.
The practice is considered harmful to girls and women and a violation of human rights.
FGM causes infertility, maternal death, infections, and the loss of sexual pleasure.

An acid attack,also called acid throwing, vitriol attack, or vitriolage, is a form of violent assault  involving the act of throwing acid or a similarly corrosive substance into the body of another ""with the intention to disfigure, maim, torture, or kill"".
Perpetrators of these attacks throw corrosive liquids at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones. Acid attacks can often lead to permanent blindness.
According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in Bangladesh, the country has reported 3000 acid attack victims since 1999, peaking at 262 victims for the year of 2002. Nearly all victims are female.Rates have been steadily decreasing by 15% to 20% since 2002, with the amount of acid attack victims reported at 91 in Bangladesh as recently as 2011.
 Bangladesh acid attacks shows the most gendered discrimination, with one study citing a male to female victim ratio of 0.15:1 and another reporting that 82% of acid attack survivors in Bangladesh are women and girls.
According to Afshin Molavi, in the early years of the revolution and following the mandating of the covering of hair by women in Iran, some women were threatened with acid attacks by Islamic vigilantes for failing to wear hijab.
In October 2014, a series of acid attacks on women occurred in the city of Isfahan, resulting in demonstrations and arrests of journalists who had covered the attacks. The attacks were thought by many Iranians to be the work of conservative Islamist vigilantes, but the Iranian government denies this.
Acid attacks in Pakistan came to international attention after the release of a documentary by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy called Saving Face (2012).
 According to Shahnaz Bukhari, the majority of these attacks occur in the summer when acid is used extensively to soak certain seeds to induce germination.
Various reasons have been given for such attacks, such as a woman dressing inappropriately or rejecting a proposal of marriage. The first known instance of an acid attack occurred in East Pakistan in 1967.
According to the Acid Survivors Foundation, up to 150 attacks occur every year. The foundation reports that the attacks are often the result in an escalation of domestic abuse, and the majority of victims are female.

Forced conversion is the adoption of a different religion or the adoption of irreligion under duress. Someone who has been forced to convert to a different religion or irreligion may continue, covertly, to adhere to the beliefs and practices which were originally held, while outwardly behaving as a convert.
In Egypt Coptic women and girls are abducted, forced to convert to Islam and marry Muslim men.
n 2009 the Washington, D.C. based group Christian Solidarity International published a study of the abductions and forced marriages and the anguish felt by the young women because returning to Christianity is against the law. Further allegations of organised abduction of Copts, trafficking and police collusion continue in 2017.
In April 2010, a bipartisan group of 17 members of the U.S. Congress expressed concern to the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Office about Coptic women who faced ""physical and sexual violence, captivity ... exploitation in forced domestic servitude or commercial sexual exploitation, and financial benefit to the individuals who secure the forced conversion of the victim.""
Each year, 1,000 Pakistani girls forcibly converted to Islam.
In 2003 a six-year-old Sikh girl  in Iraq was kidnapped by a member of the Afridi tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; the alleged kidnapper claimed the girl was actually 12-years-old, and had converted to Islam so therefore could not be returned to her non-Muslim family.

Worldwide sad facts:

Violence Against Women and Girls:
    One in five women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime.
    Women are more likely to be beaten, raped, or killed by a current or former partner than by any other person, with most studies estimating that 20 to 50 percent of women experience partner violence at some point in their lives.
    In the United States, a woman is abused, usually by her husband or partner, every 15 seconds and is raped every 90 seconds.
    One hundred and two countries have no specific legal provisions against domestic violence, and in at least fifty-three countries, marital rape is not a prosecutable offense.
    Between five hundred thousand and 2 million people-the majority of them women and children-are trafficked annually into situations including prostitution, forced labor, slavery, or servitude. Only 93 countries have some legislative provision prohibiting trafficking in human beings.
    The UN estimates that approximately five thousand women are murdered each year as a result of honor killings, but many women’s groups in the Middle East and Southwest Asia suspect the number is at least four times higher.

Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking of Women and Girls:
    There are approximately 27 million slaves alive today-more than at any point in history and 56 percent are women.
    The average price of a trafficked human is at a historic low of $90, which means that it is sometimes more “cost-effective” for traffickers to allow their victims to die than to provide them with adequate conditions and health care.
    Slavery is an extremely profitable, international industry. It is estimated that trafficking in the United States yields $9 billion every year, and around the world, trafficking in women for commercial sex purposes nets $6 billion per year.
    Roughly 14,500 to 17,500 foreign nationals are trafficked into the United States each
    year. California is a major trafficking entry point, with 43 percent of California trafficking incidents occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area alone.
    In the United States 70 percent of all prostitution is handled by pimps, who keep most of the money, and it is estimated that 70 percent of prostitutes experience multiple rapes each year-some as frequently as once a week.
    The typical age of entry into prostitution is 13 to 14 and almost 33 percent of the women got started in prostitution through family members or friends.
    Some estimates claim there are at least 300,000 children in prostitution, while others
    believe the numbers may be as high as 500,000 to 1.2 million.
    Worldwide, an estimated 51 million girls have been married before the age of consent. In many parts of the world, parents encourage the marriage of their underage daughters in exchange for property and livestock or to benefit their social status.
    The sexual violation and torture of civilian women and girls during periods of armed
    conflict has been referred to as “one of history’s great silences” and has generally been ignored despite the millions who have been injured and killed by the brutal practice. Trafficking of women and girls was reported in 85 percent of the world’s conflict zones.

Education:
    Of the 781 million illiterate adults in the developing world, two-thirds are women, and nearly one out of every five girls who enrolls in primary school does not complete her primary education.
    Nearly three-quarters of girls out of school are from excluded groups such as ethnic minorities, isolated clans, and very poor households, even though these groups represent only 20 percent of the world’s population.
    Educated women have greater control over their financial resources and are more likely than men to invest their resources in their families’ health, education, and nutrition.
    No country has ever achieved continuous and rapid economic growth without first having at least 40 percent of its adults able to read and write. An extra year of primary school boosts girls’ eventual wages by 10 to 20 percent and an extra year of secondary school increases earnings by 15 to 25 percent.
    Educating women increases productivity in agrarian communities. According to a 2005 report by the United Nations (UN), if female farmers in Kenya were provided with the same education and resources as male farmers, crop yields could rise by 22 percent.
    One year of female schooling reduces fertility by 10 percent and a child born to a woman who can read is 50 percent more likely to survive past age 5. Women with formal education are much more likely to use reliable family planning methods, delay marriage and childbearing, and have fewer and healthier babies.
    Education fosters democracy and women’s political participation. A study in Bangladesh found that educated women are three times more likely to take part in political meetings than those without schooling.
    Girls’ education ranks among the most powerful tools for reducing vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. A study in Zambia found that AIDS spreads twice as fast among uneducated girls than girls who have access to education. Young rural Ugandans with secondary education are three times less likely to contract HIV.

“In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure no one listens.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“... in practice the standard for what constitutes rape is set not at the level of women's experience of violation but just above the level of coercion acceptable to men.”
― Judith Lewis Herman

""Pornography has been so thickly glossed over with the patina of chic these days in the name of verbal freedom and sophisication… Part of the problem is that those who traditionally have been the most vigorous opponents of porn are often those same people who shudder at the explicit mention of any sexual subject… There can be no equality in porn, no female equivalent, no turning of the tables in the name of bawdy fun. Pornography, like rape, is a male invention, desgined to dehumanize women… Pornography is the undiluted essence of anti-female propoganda.""
Susan Brownmiller

""Pornography is used in rape - to plan it, to execute it, to choreograph it, to engender the excitement to commit the act.""
Andrea Dworkin

The worldwide misogyny and contempt for women are expressed, above all, in sadistic pornography and forced prostitution worldwide in such an extreme form that we have to speak of sexual femicide and sexual terrorism for men.


Misogynist thinking and acting is everyday life in Germany. For example, every fourth woman and every second girl in Germany experiences beatings or rape.
Causes of misogyny are also male and female role models that are deeply anchored in society: men and boys should be tough and take what they want, women and girls should be sexy and available.
These role models supposedly provide orientation, but ultimately ""posing"" often prevents boys and girls / men and women from getting really close.
In the worst case, the unconscious replay of role models leads to violence against women, girls and female children because they are treated like objects.
Violence against women occurs in all social classes and groups. Specifically, in 2017 alone 114,000 acts of violence in partnerships were reported in which women were the victims. The number of unreported cases is very high. According to a Europe-wide study, only about 13 percent of women affected report serious incidents of violence to the police. Why is that? How is it that so many men do not regard women as equals and treat them disrespectfully?
Sexism, pornography and misogyny are ubiquitous around the world. E.g. when a group of guys talk about who ""cleared"" a girl. Because boys use it to express that they perceive girls as objects. ""Things"" that a man ""gets"", ""takes"" or ""belongs to"".
Many young women play this game, mostly unconsciously: by portraying themselves as a sexual object through outward appearances, including on social media, and by expecting the young man to take the first step and conquer them. And here you have to speak of a brainwashing of women by the media, society and politics. Because if female children, girls and women already feel worthless and let themselves be pushed into the role of sex dolls and birthing machines, why should men and boys still have respect for such objects that they consider completely worthless and see them as human beings?
There is toxic masculinity everywhere, which manifests itself in the so-called macho culture, rape culture, forced and child marriages, honor killings, acid assassinations, forced veiling, FGM, dowry and witch killings, the accusing, imprisoning, torturing and executing female victims, stoning is very popular here in Muslim countries for girls and women, in war, mass, group rape, sexual assault on the street, in school, university or at work, not to mention the very common domestic violence and sexual child abuse.
It is not optimistic about the horrific crimes and hate crimes against women around the world, mostly with impunity!
And anyone who wants to take refuge in music as a woman will be unpleasantly surprised:
In hip hop, men sing about how they make women ""clear"", feel superior to them, abuse them. All of this is sold as ""cool"" and often hits the charts. At the expense of women. A lot of porn has a similar dynamic: Here, too, male power fantasies are served. Even the porn actress Lena Nitro sees this critically: She demands a porn driver's license so that no one under 18 can watch porn films. In any case, porn gives a completely wrong picture of what ""normal sexuality"" is.
Porn scripts do not know equality! The biggest misogynists are clearly pornographers because they glorify violence, torture, humiliation, sexual femicide. That has nothing to do with normal sexuality!
Anyone who doesn't know each other well and cannot confidently say what he / she (does not) want comes under pressure from porn. Typical porn scripts are not about two people agreeing on an equal footing about what they enjoy. Rather, the man generally exercises power over the woman. He takes what he wants and she has to obey. Basically, both genders lose: women lose their dignity and both the freedom for feelings and the chance to be close.
What happens with pornography and re-enactment during intercourse is something like this: ""This is exactly what happens with porn, that it is not fun of equal value, but rather a 'I'm going off on her and taking my fun out of it'.""

There is also an understanding of hierarchy, for example that men are superior. Misogyny is used to secure male power and dominance in society.
Role patterns can be observed almost everywhere: in the school yard, in the disco, at public festivals. Here alcohol, crowds and wide-cut, short dirndls ensure that inhibitions fall. Where is the line between flirtation and assault? Are short dresses or large necklines an ""invitation to grope""? - A couple of men interviewed by moderator Ramo Ali tend to give it a try. And some even see a ""no"" as an occasion to become more persistent.
The women, in turn, report regular attacks: verbally and tangibly. As a female you almost have to expect that at an event like the Regensburg Maidult, a small ""Oktoberfest"". One of the women questioned is nevertheless outraged: Dressing sexy does not mean that she wants to be touched everywhere. Even when inhibitions are falling, men should know that ""just reaching out"" is taboo.
And they don't know that from my 65-year-old life experience. The so-called catcalling with often disgusting slogans and insults is familiar to every woman, every woman and every girl knows such slogans and such behavior at celebrations, parties and events, often enough it also happens at school, at university and at work. Even at home, women are not safe there, even in their own four walls and at family celebrations there is a lot to be heard and anyone who does not smile and join in here as a woman is considered abnormal and at best a brake on fun!
That is why it is damned important not to participate anymore as a woman and to say: Stop it, enough now, we are human beings and we want to be treated as such!
In courses for feminist self-assertion, women learn to build inner strength and clearly convey their limits: So far and no further! It starts with making them aware of their limits. Then they mentally act out dangerous situations: What to do if steps approach from behind in the dark? Anna Pytlak has had traumatic experiences. The very thought of the steps from behind triggers a panic attack in her. Other participants react less dramatically. However, many find it difficult to act loudly and decisively at the crucial moment instead of becoming silent and rigid. But this determination can be trained.

Learning to assert yourself can empower women individually. But in order to really fight misogyny, other role models are needed across society.
Unfortunately there are damned many forms of sexual violence and sexual violence has not decreased, no increased, because we live in the thought of pseudo-equality that does not exist worldwide. The men still have the real say, they just want to make us believe that this is not the case and that if we feel that way, we should urgently see a psychiatrist:

Forms of (sexual) violence against women:

In music videos or pornographic films, women often become mere objects: a ""thing"" that men can use. Women and girls are denied a right to self-determination.
""Victim blaming"" happens frequently: women are persuaded that it is their own fault that they have been the victim of an assault. For example because they were wearing a mini skirt.
Femicide means: women are killed because they are women. For example, because they had sex or were raped before marriage. The perpetrators, mostly from the family, call this ""honor killing"".
Women are also victims of digital violence on the Internet. Women are regularly victims of digital stalking by their exes.

What equality really looks like can be observed every day by women around the world from the sexual cyberstalking, the sexual online terror and the misogynistic online haters, it is a modern sexual witch hunt that takes place without exception on all women, the pornography of all society has lowered the inhibition threshold damn well!
Our society lays the roots for sexism and misogyny early on, for example with role models. It takes a lot of (self) awareness and a lot of conversations between men and women to get more understanding and respect for one another. In this way, ""toxic"" masculinity and violence against women can be reduced step by step. But that can only happen if paid rape in the worst and sadistic form such as pornography and prostitution is finally abolished worldwide and permanently. We women neither need prostitution nor pornography nor men in this world who claim that they cannot live without it.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0

Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter and his very bad misogynist friends.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k. The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.
The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Women fight back, because only then can you finally put an end to this indescribable misery.

books about:

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Know My Name: The Survivor of the Stanford Sexual Assault Case Tells Her Story/Chanel Miller (Autor)
To girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought every day for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you.'
Chanel Miller's story changed our world forever. In 2016 Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail after he was caught sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. His light sentencing, and Chanel's victim impact statement, which was read by eleven million people in four days, sparked international outrage and action.

Entwining pain, resilience, and humour, this breath-taking memoir will stand as a modern classic.

In 2014, Chessy Prout was a freshman at St. Paul’s School, a prestigious boarding school in New Hampshire, when a senior boy sexually assaulted her as part of a ritualized game of conquest. Chessy bravely reported her assault to the police and testified against her attacker in court. Then, in the face of unexpected backlash from her once-trusted school community, she shed her anonymity to help other survivors find their voice.
This memoir is more than an account of a horrific event. It takes a magnifying glass to the institutions that turn a blind eye to such behavior and a society that blames victims rather than perpetrators. Chessy’s story offers real, powerful solutions to upend rape culture as we know it today. Prepare to be inspired by this remarkable young woman and her story of survival, advocacy, and hope in the face of unspeakable trauma.

Tears of the Silenced: An Amish True Crime Memoir of Childhood Sexual Abuse, Brutal Betrayal, and Ultimate Survival/Misty Griffin (Autor)
When Misty Griffin was six years old, her family started to live and dress like the Amish. Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their stepfather kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care.
When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. After she escaped and reported the bishop, she found herself alone in a modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card.
Misty has a message for abuse survivors: “Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken. This is my story of survival and moving past the abuse to embrace my dreams.” In June 2019 Misty graduated nursing school. She continues to work to raise awareness about child abuse and sexual assault.

Broken and Betrayed: The True Story of the Rotherham Abuse Scandal by the Woman Who Fought to Expose It/ Jayne Senior (Autor) 
For fourteen years, Jayne Senior tried to help girls from Rotherham who had been groomed, raped, tortured, pimped and threatened with violence by sex traffickers. As the manager of Risky Business, which was set up to work with vulnerable teens, she heard heartbreaking and shocking stories of abuse and assiduously kept notes and details of the perpetrators, passing information on to the authorities in the belief that they would do something. Eventually, when she lost hope that the authorities would take action against the gangs she had identified as the abusers, she became a whistleblower for The Times investigative reporter Andrew Norfolk.
Now, in her powerful memoir Broken and Betrayed, she describes a life spent working to protect Rotherham's girls, the pressure put on her to stop rocking the boat, and why she risked prison in the hope that she could help end the appalling child exploitation in the town.

Lucky /Alice Sebold (Autor)
In a memoir hailed for its searing candor, as well as its wit, Alice Sebold reveals how her life was transformed when, as an eighteen-year-old college freshman, she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. What ultimately propels this chronicle of sexual assault and its aftermath is Sebold’s indomitable spirit, as she fights to secure her rapist’s arrest and conviction and comes to terms with a relationship to the world that has forever changed. With over a million copies in print, Lucky has touched the lives of a generation of readers. Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims and imparts a wisdom profoundly hard-won: “You save yourself or you remain unsaved.” Now reissued with a new afterword by the author, her story remains as urgent as it was when it was first published eighteen years ago.",0,0,Event,28451845,2,comment,2021-04-22 11:41:54+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],kamala-harris-support-amber-heard-stop-domestic-violence-against-women,kamala-harris-support-amber-heard-stop-domestic-violence-against-women_limit_1,for

A massive script [not to mention storyline] rewrite can't and won't successfully solve, or [as I would enjoy properly labeling] fool the audience and fans of this new cult classic franchise. It's not fantastic without Depp, merely just beasts and where not to find Johnny Depp. I dont believe the general public are really demanding for another painfully awful sequel to the PotC series at the moment. Most people just plainly didn't enjoy the last two films in the pirates franchise so calling Depp off the gallows noose for yet another terrible addition to pirates will in my view actually probably help his career more than that of what some people are thinking that pirates will somehow hurt his career more. Disney is doing him a huge favor even though everything happening to Johnny Depp as of late is supposed to be an unofficial punishment for something being dealt with in his own private life.

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter and his women hating friends.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Nowhere does the hatred of cowardly, sadistic, women-hating men discharge so much as, for example, in sexual witch hunts on the Internet, in group and mass rapes, in sexual group stalking, in sexual street harassment, in honor killings and forced marriages with children combined with female genital mutilation, in child prostitution and sex trafficking in girls. They are only strong in the crowd. Otherwise they are pathetic figures and cowards.
I point out that my group stalkers have ejaculated and shit together in my garden, for example. One alone can hardly have managed this mass and mess. The harassment on the net also came from an extremely misogynistic and sexually sadistic male mob. I am one of millions who are affected by it and that is the sad thing, the female victims are ridiculed, the perpetrators are celebrated, quite sick and perverted or ..
The mirror is the network: sheer hatred, typed, posted - and targeted against women: that as a woman you are exposed to other types of hostility, that it becomes very sexist very quickly, becomes very hurtful, goes very below the belt towards, rape fantasies and sexual murder plans in social networks, the cases are worldwide extremely often.
Male group violence has only one thing in mind: to destroy women, girls, female children. This is how we can imagine the emergence of male rule and patriarchy. They have been playing this disgusting game for as long as there have been men.
In around a third of the cases, women were supposed to be reprimanded who, in the eyes of the perpetrators, had violated social norms. Sometimes the victim behaved in a dismissive manner towards a man, sometimes the attackers found the behavior or clothing of the victim to be too ""unfeminine"", too little submissive, to strong or too feminist. The triggers are always just pretexts, sometimes the victim did not want to be sexually humiliated, harassed, stalked or beaten by the perpetrators, sometimes she campaigned for women's or human rights, or she has a other religion or skin color or sometimes she was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. Everything is fine for the cowardly creeps, the main thing is that they can get started with humilation, harassment violence, rape, torture and murder.
To portray yourself as strong guys and ""let it rip"" with friends is another motive for many perpetrators.
And not only women are victims of such perpetrators, but also young men and male adolescents and children, even animals.
How can a woman still have respect for men as a woman? Is it really hard or ...

The group psychological dynamics is probably also the reason why several perpetrators tend to act more brutally and cattle than a single one.

Amazingly, there are women among the perpetrators. Some lure a female mate to a place where she can be abused by male group members. Others even actively participate in the rape, detaining, filming, or helping to strip the victim. Unfortunately there are always women and girls who are stupid enough to lick the offenders' boots or other things.

As long as there are women and girls who support such male cattle, the women and girls who fight for their rights will always lose. As sorry as I am, but these female silly beasts also deserve punishment, they have ensured for time immemorial that we will fight for survival to this day and that we will never have real equality until so stupid females exist.

And the crime sexual group stalking in the reality and in the internet is on rising. A dangerous hate crime against females.
Stalking is defined as a pattern of behavior (or a series of actions) directed at a specific person that cause that individual to feel afraid or in danger. Examples include but are not limited to:  threatening, repeated harassing behavior that causes a person to fear for their personal safety, unwanted contact, monitoring, unwelcome appearances or following. 

Stalking is unpredictable and dangerous. No two stalking situations are alike. Anyone can be a victim of stalking, regardless of their gender identity, sexuality, ability status, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, etc. However, research shows that those who come from oppressed and marginalized backgrounds and identities are at an increased risk of experiecning higher rates of stalking/violence. 

The vast majority of stalking victims know their stalker, usually because they have had a relationship with them. The stalker can be an intimate partner or former partner, classmate, roommate, or other acquaintance. A victim can be stalked for several days or for many years. The stalker’s actions also can affect family, friends, and coworkers. Stalking can be difficult to distinguish, which contributes to a lack of public awareness about the crime of stalking. 
To an outsider, stalking behavior can appear friendly and unthreatening, such as the receipt of  numerous gifts or flattering messages.  The person experiencing this behavior may find themselves needing to explain to others just how intrusive and frightening this unwanted attention can be.  Stalking is sometimes dismissed when it occurs in digital spaces (cell phones, computers, networking sites, surveillance equipment, and so on), but the medium is not what matters—it is the pattern of repeated, unwanted communication that defines stalking.
Take, for example, accused attorney Danford Grant. Described as an up-and-comer in an elite Seattle law firm, he has been charged with four sexual attacks on three different female massage therapists. And, as the details in the charges emerge, these attacks appear to be well-planned and researched.

For example, during a rape-at-knife-point of a Bellevue, Washington massage therapist, Grant allegedly told the woman that he had been research on her and accurately recited her home address and husband’s name. If convicted, Danford Grant would be an example of one of the rarest and most dangerous types of stalkers — the predatory stalker.
For the predatory stalker, stalking is foreplay; the real goal is sexual assault. While they may gain satisfaction from the sense of control and power stalking gives them over the victim, it’s the violent and sexual fantasies that they engage in while researching, planning, and following the victim that really gets them off as they prepare for the ultimate thrill — the sexual assault itself.

The stalking may have a sadistic quality to it. For example, some predatory stalkers mess with their victim’s minds by leaving subtle clues that they are being followed without revealing their identity. However, even when the victim is unaware that she is being stalked, the perpetrator can still take delight in the details — deciding how long to prolong the suspense, rehearsing the attack, fantasizing about the victim’s response.
Predatory stalkers are also most likely to lead double lives, leaving their friends and family stunned and disbelieving when they are finally caught. Night stalker Delroy Grant, for example, who stalked, raped, and terrorized retired pensioners for years, was viewed as a friendly, self-sacrificing neighbor who religiously cared for his wife who was paralyzed from the neck down from multiple sclerosis. Midwestern “Mall Rapist” James Perry stalked young girls in the malls and shopping center parking lots, was a popular member of his suburban community, where he lived with his wife and two young children.
If you are a woman and you have such a person in your life, then you and all around you in a very great danger. If this person has bad friends, then run so fast as you can, or it can be your last day on earth.

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome.

This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Mekisha Jane Walker takes you through her journey; a strong-willed successful attorney by day and a domestic violence victim by night. With her secret revealed, she was faced with the question, “why did you stay?” This is her answer to the question. She is a force to be reckoned with and she has survived to tell her tale. This compelling page-turner is a powerful read that will help eliminate the shame associated with being labeled a victim and that will raise awareness for this dirty secret that so many strong-willed women living with are afraid to talk about.
This is a definitely MUST READ BOOK for every woman out there. If you have teenage daughters, make sure they read it as well. Family Law Attorneys, this will be a great gift for your next client that has taken the first step to end their misery in a terrible relationship. Domestic violence is very real, very painful and unforgettable. I am so proud of our friend, Mekisha Jane Walker, for sharing her personal story and providing resources to help those in need.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

Cyber Crimes against Women in India/ Debarati Halder (Author), K Jaishankar
Cyber Crimes against Women in India reveals loopholes in the present laws and policies of the Indian judicial system, and what can be done to ensure safety in cyberspace.
The book is a signi­ficant contribution to socio-legal research on online crimes targeting teenage girls and women. It shows how they become soft targets of trolling, online grooming, privacy infringement, bullying, pornography, sexual defamation, morphing, spoofi­ng and so on.
The authors address various raging debates in the country such as how women can be protected from cybercrimes; what steps can be taken as prevention and as recourse to legal aid and how useful and accessible cyber laws are. The book provides detailed answers to a wide array of questions that bother scholars and charts a way forward.

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the partial or complete removal of the external female genitals for cultural rather than medical or religious reasons―its origin is unknown. Practitioners believe the procedure enhances the girl’s health, hygiene, chastity, fertility and marriage prospects―the truth is it obliterates sexual pleasure, causes severe health problems and is sometimes fatal. This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

Ijeoma: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughters /Richard Sacks (Author)
Ijeoma: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughters focuses on eighteen-year-old Ijeoma, who is forced to undergo the ruthless act of tribal cutting as a condition of marriage to an abusive man who threatens the same on his daughters. Ijeoma, inspired by true events, follows Ijeoma as she leaves her Nigerian village for New York, vowing that what was forced on her will not happen to her children. But her plans are stalled after she is arrested and detained, awaiting a deportation that could send her and her daughters back across the ocean to a fate that is too horrific to bear.

Beautiful: A beautiful girl. An evil man. One inspiring true story of courage/Katie Piper (Author)
'I heard a horrible screaming sound, like an animal being slaughtered ... then I realised it was me.'
When Katie Piper was 24, her life was near perfect. Young and beautiful, she was well on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming a model.
But then she met Daniel Lynch on Facebook and her world quickly turned into a nightmare ...
After being held captive and brutally raped by her new boyfriend, Katie was subjected to a vicious acid attack. Within seconds, this bright and bubbly girl could feel her looks and the life she loved melting away.
Beautiful is the moving true story of how one young woman had her mind, body and spirit cruelly snatched from her and how she inspired millions with her fight to get them back.

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced/Nujood Ali (Author)
“I’m a simple village girl who has always obeyed the orders of my father and brothers. Since forever, I have learned to say yes to everything. Today I have decided to say no.”
Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.
Hers is an unforgettable story of tragedy, triumph, and courage.

816483536,"Ms Heard claimed to have donated millions of her divorce settlement to two charities. Subsequent court proceedings indicate that years later they have not received any donations from her. Charities rely on people making good on their pledge so that they can help those that are less fortunate. She pledged $3.5m to each charity, a total of $7m.

- I will no longer support any charity or cause Ms Heard is an ambassador of. (Apologies to the charities but you will need to find more appropriate advocates or ambassadors).

- I will no longer buy or support any product Ms Heard is promoting, paid or otherwise. Including employment in any capacity she has in any aspect within the media, particularly the movie industry. 

- Her performance as “Mera”, to be blunt, sucked. I hope they find a better actress if only to have a more believable character as well as easier dialogue with other actors (I felt bad for Mamoa, she ruined Aquaman for him).",0,0,Event,20187467,0,comment,2021-04-10 22:03:23+00:00,,43698145,43698145,Emma,Warburton,Emma,Emma Warburton,,,AU,,en-AU,,220675408.0,photos/8/ea/is/QCEaisCKeuQWddy-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ea/is/QCEaisCKeuQWddy-48x48-noPad.jpg?1527841690,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ea/is/QCEaisCKeuQWddy-128x128-noPad.jpg?1527841690,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ea/is/QCEaisCKeuQWddy-400x400-noPad.jpg?1527841690,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ea/is/QCEaisCKeuQWddy-800x800-noPad.jpg?1527841690,False,800.0,800.0,[],warner-brothers-amber-heard-does-not-deserve-to-play-mera-in-the-next-aquaman-film,warner-brothers-amber-heard-does-not-deserve-to-play-mera-in-the-next-aquaman-film_limit_1,against

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt.

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped.

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 16 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Mekisha Jane Walker takes you through her journey; a strong-willed successful attorney by day and a domestic violence victim by night. With her secret revealed, she was faced with the question, “why did you stay?” This is her answer to the question. She is a force to be reckoned with and she has survived to tell her tale. This compelling page-turner is a powerful read that will help eliminate the shame associated with being labeled a victim and that will raise awareness for this dirty secret that so many strong-willed women living with are afraid to talk about.
This is a definitely MUST READ BOOK for every woman out there. If you have teenage daughters, make sure they read it as well. Family Law Attorneys, this will be a great gift for your next client that has taken the first step to end their misery in a terrible relationship. Domestic violence is very real, very painful and unforgettable. I am so proud of our friend, Mekisha Jane Walker, for sharing her personal story and providing resources to help those in need.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

Cyber Crimes against Women in India/ Debarati Halder (Author), K Jaishankar

The authors address various raging debates in the country such as how women can be protected from cybercrimes; what steps can be taken as prevention and as recourse to legal aid and how useful and accessible cyber laws are. The book provides detailed answers to a wide array of questions that bother scholars and charts a way forward.

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the partial or complete removal of the external female genitals for cultural rather than medical or religious reasons―its origin is unknown. Practitioners believe the procedure enhances the girl’s health, hygiene, chastity, fertility and marriage prospects―the truth is it obliterates sexual pleasure, causes severe health problems and is sometimes fatal. This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

Ijeoma: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughters /Richard Sacks (Author)
Ijeoma: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughters focuses on eighteen-year-old Ijeoma, who is forced to undergo the ruthless act of tribal cutting as a condition of marriage to an abusive man who threatens the same on his daughters. Ijeoma, inspired by true events, follows Ijeoma as she leaves her Nigerian village for New York, vowing that what was forced on her will not happen to her children.

Beautiful: A beautiful girl. An evil man. One inspiring true story of courage/Katie Piper (Author)
'I heard a horrible screaming sound, like an animal being slaughtered ... then I realised it was me.'
When Katie Piper was 24, her life was near perfect. Young and beautiful, she was well on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming a model.
But then she met Daniel Lynch on Facebook and her world quickly turned into a nightmare ...
After being held captive and brutally raped by her new boyfriend, Katie was subjected to a vicious acid attack. Within seconds, this bright and bubbly girl could feel her looks and the life she loved melting away.
Beautiful is the moving true story of how one young woman had her mind, body and spirit cruelly snatched from her and how she inspired millions with her fight to get them back.

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced/Nujood Ali (Author)
“I’m a simple village girl who has always obeyed the orders of my father and brothers. Since forever, I have learned to say yes to everything. Today I have decided to say no.”
Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.
Hers is an unforgettable story of tragedy, triumph, and courage.

817483731,"I couldn't agree more with this petition. Not only does this judge appear have questionable ties to the defendents' side, his choice to set aside evidence and police witness on the basis of the assumption that a key witness for the defense wouldn't lie under oath when it has become clear that she has done so at least once in Australia, sets a deplorable precedent that allows taped spontaneous confessions to be overruled or even completely disregarded in favour of a statement made under oath. Does this judge not allow for the fact that a criminal might lie under oath to evade justice? 
He said Ms Heard donating the 7 mill she received from Mr Depp as part of their divorce wasn't the action of a gold-digger, and it appears this has influenced his judgement more than any of the evidence put before him - and to top this off, it then turned out, Ms Heard, who has been widely touting her good deed in the media, did not donate at all! 
It appears clear that for whatever reason, Justice Nicol was woefully biased, and there ought to be an investigation as to whether this is the case and if so what lies at the root of it. 
Faith in the UK justice system has been severely damaged by this verdict, an impartial investigation might rectify this damage. If not, and this verdict is allowed to stand as it is, the conclusion especially for male survivors of DV can only be that if even someone like Johnny Depp, with a mountain of evidence amd witnesses cannot get a fair trial, then it is better to remain silent and not put yourself through this ordeal.

This is not the first time this man has been found to be corrupt and he needs to held accountable. How can anyone have faith in the justice system if it quite clearly shows absolutely no regard for victims of domestic violence and champions their abuser? It goes further in proving to them that their fear in coming forward  of not being believed is well founded if all she had to do was smile sweetly and look ""sad"" tell her tale whilst lying through her teeth on the stand without producing a shred of evidence! I have been in such a relationship where in I also suffered domestic violence and listening to her in those audio tapes and I was right back there SHE WAS NO VICTIM SHE WAS THE PERPETRATOR! and Nichol helped her and the Sun to further torment her victim SHAME on them and Shame on him!!

Yes, they say this, yet, there are spammed men's rights hate groups and they're never brought down or accused. How can this world continue to praise and accolade men for doing nothing? That's where we start to get meglomaniacs who get money handed to them and tyrants. 
Amber Heard is struggling in an era which is so harmful for women online, where these companies don't care about women for many years.

The other petition is just bots. It's proven and change does nothing. In fact, they added a 'share popup' to it when told that sharing makes them think it's real.
I don't know what is wrong with these tech companies, but they're worse than the alt right.

You're doing an amazing job and the REAL people (off social media) care and know you're right. Even if not everyone does, it's making a difference one person at a time.

As for the comment that never gets removed by Change.org for being anti-lgbt and anti-women, the only way to get out of harmful relationships is to ask for help from other people. Abusers typically isolate their victims and Depp was isolating Amber Heard. Also, many in the hollywood industry will tell their workers to not say where they are going, who they are with, etc. It's amazing that there were any texts or records at all. She defied the culture to protect herself. Even then, there could have been more witnesses than there are now.

Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home for if a woman cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere.”

""Show me an abuse of women in society, I'll show it to you made sex in the pornography. If you want to know who is being hurt in this society, go see what is being done and to whom in pornography and then go look for them other places in the world. You will find them being hurt in just that way.""

""Pornography is now beyond anyone’s control. It’s a classic example of ever-controversial unregulated capitalism — the market automatically responding to individual needs and desires. I continue to support and defend pornography, which I believe exposes the deepest, darkest truths about sexuality.""

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”
― Sierra D. Waters, Debbie

“The rape of a child is a violent act of contempt, not an expression of sexuality or affection.”
― Mike Lew, Gay Men and Childhood Sexual Trauma

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""
-Andrea Dworkin

"" Women are socially disadvantaged in controlling sexual access to their bodies through socialization to customs that define a woman's body as for sexual use by men. Sexual access is regularly forced or pressured or routinized beyond denial.""

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 16 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith. 'A compelling, disturbing examination of a tradition that stubbornly persists in modern Turkey' -- Guardian

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

Armed Survivor/ Christine Hand-Gonzales Ed.D. (Author)

He tracked her every move, day and night, weekdays and weekends for several months. Lurking in the dark, this predator, a Cuban national, planned his attack. Had he done this before? Was he seeking asylum and sanctuary in the United States to avoid jail time in Cuba for pending rape and murder charges? It will become apparent that this convicted felon and pathological liar did not fear extradition, our legal system, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or the Department of Homeland Security. Had he found refuge and protection in ""sanctuary cities?""Follow these two lives to understand how this freak encounter between two strangers occurred; then, learn how to protect yourself from such attacks.

I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced/Nujood Ali (Author)
“I’m a simple village girl who has always obeyed the orders of my father and brothers. Since forever, I have learned to say yes to everything. Today I have decided to say no.”
Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.
Hers is an unforgettable story of tragedy, triumph, and courage.

You Are Not Your Rape: an anthology /Tianna G Hansen (Editor)
In a time where the news tells tales of accused rape and those who speak out are ridiculed, sent death threats, shamed, made to feel unsafe... this project is all the more important and necessary. To provide a permanent home for those voices who refuse to stay silent, despite this. Despite the trauma we endure.
This is an influential time for us to speak out.
In this collection, you'll find over 100 voices - stories by and about sexual abuse and assault survivors, told in creative nonfiction, poems and flash.
We are survivors and there are many steps on this journey. Empowerment is a process. We honor every step, the fledgling ones and the dark hopelessness too.

817110919,"Change culture so that women can say they're victims of domestic abuse. Those saying they're victims while attacking Amber are fake... 

Maybe I didn't get beat up or sexually abused physically, but I could have been. Then it's so scary to ever say that because it's silenced and retaliated. Women cannot just leave their homes or get away from abusers. Abusers continue to harm women even when they put distance between them. It's happening right now with Amber's example too. 
Men often are richer, then they use this power and leverage to harm women that 'leave' them AND their children, such as myself. The stalking, the phone calls of breathing, this and that. Now, Depp can harm Amber the same way, but using others since he's rich enough.
Now, they want to invalidate 12 times of domestic violence?! Really?! When we see this, how many more years will it be in the United States until people like myself can ever say we were victims? When I see this, how can I say I'm a victim or others? Because harassment didn't lead to violence when it could have because we avoided it?

Amber Heard is a victim and it's so great that she spoke out. I know there's fear in saying that, but I definitely call her a victim as a 3rd party. She went through extreme violence.

Even though Amber Heard had two of her friends lie about commotion in their apartment and she herself lied on many occasions about Johnny, the LAPD found zero evidence. And yet Amber herself have been arrested in the past for abusing an ex-girlfriend. Why are you listening to a lying, narcissistic abuser? Bring Johnny back! Or at least give him the option.

AH is a convicted abuser before Depp married her. AH was seen hitting her then girlfriend, by a police officer, who immediately arrested her. There are many who have witnessed and been the subject to her rage & physical abuse.
It's sickening that not only was Depp physically abused by AH, but that this abuse continues by Disney & Warner Brothers, victimizing him for being a victim... pulling him from our beloved movies, while the lying convicted abuser, AH is still allowed to be a terrible actor.
I personally will vote with my money. 
I will Not pay to see a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Johnny Depp (nor will I pay to see Fantastic Beast without Depp).
And, even though I love Jason Mamoa, I will Not pay to see any movie with AH in it.

(Don’t get me wrong spouse abuse is very wrong). But to believe that Johnny after all these years decided to do such things is unbelievable. In fact it’s almost impossible. He’s never had a private life and all of his relationships have been beyond public. The only difference with this one is that amber has previous accounts of spousal abuse.

He deserves to have his career a career he worked hard for and every single role he had ever played he had made his own and we have all loved him in. #JUSTICE FOR JOHNNY❤️,0,0,Event,20186707,1,comment,2021-03-25 22:28:52+00:00,,19917757,19917757,Sherry,Kelly,Sherry,Sherry Kelly,Vancouver,WA,US,,en-US,,225364358.0,photos/1/ti/rw/eZTIRwOFelECoob-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/1/ti/rw/eZTIRwOFelECoob-48x48-noPad.jpg?1616711381,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/1/ti/rw/eZTIRwOFelECoob-128x128-noPad.jpg?1616711382,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/1/ti/rw/eZTIRwOFelECoob-400x400-noPad.jpg?1616711383,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/1/ti/rw/eZTIRwOFelECoob-800x800-noPad.jpg?1616711383,False,800.0,800.0,[],justice-for-johnny-depp,justice-for-johnny-depp_limit_1,against

811898624,"The way Johnny has been treated in court and by media is UNACCEPTABLE. He is innocent, there's even proof that Amber was the abuser in their relationship! Johnny was labeled as a ""wife beater"" by the sun, the media belives Amber's absurd allegations towards him and his reputation is on the edge of being destroyed. He has lost his role in Fantastic beasts as Grindelwald and he also lost one of his most iconic roles ever, Jack Sparrow from the pirates of the Caribbean movies. 

More and more evidence of Amber being the abuser has come out to the public but that's not enough. We all have to help Johnny, the actor who played a big role in our childhoods, the actor who loves his fans more than anything, the actor who's never abusive towards his loved ones. It's time for us to do our part, support him and be there for him no matter how much that crazy woman fucks up his reputation.

811460634,"Listened to the recordings of Amber heard's abuse towards Johnny despicable. I've heard the same words from my abuser ""I was hitting you not punching you."" she assaulted him  when all he was trying to do was find a safe place in the bathroom to hide from the anger and daily abuse likely. Women it's never okay to hit a man. just like men should never hit a woman. you should never hit anyone except to protect yourself from the harm you are receiving from some one and have no other choice. being a survivor of abuse seeing the exact same behaviors in the recordings from amber as my abuser it's clear she abused johnny.  she messed up by divorcing johnny because she sabotaged her own cycle of abuse and manipulation. she did him a favor and turned to fictitious claims of abuse when her act backfired. it's textbook abuse from a female perpetrator.  If johnny did hit her it was likely in self defense from one of her ""hitting"" sprees. There is nothing more terrifying then seeing the deranged look on the face of some on you love as they ""hit"" you as hard as they can pretending they are ""play fighting""  there is no difference between ""hitting"" and punching. And there is no weaker feeling then telling some one to stop hitting you and they won't even if you are stronger and able to get a hold of their hands and pin them down so they can't hit you. they will just wait and hit you again. No matter how many times you tell them to stop. You can hear the insecurities that are the center of amber's abuse. She's afraid that if she stops abusing him that johnny will split and leave her. So she stages anger fits and pushes him to try and resolve the situation of her anger to keep him in this cycle of dealing with her shit so he can't think of anything else. it's very evident that no other ex of his would expect him abusing some one and that they never received any abuse while with him that any physical abuse that johnny depp ""did"" was likely self defense from physical abuse from Amber. she is textbook abuser. And johnny reacts reacts to the violence is textbook male victim. he acknowledges that injury he caused her was wrong in the recording and when he tries to open her eyes up to the abuse she freaks out and runs takes off. knowing she got his attention that effectively she won and achieved her goal. subconsciously that is what she did. no accountability for hurting depp. you can't chase some one down when they are trying to get away  force yourself on them and hit them and not be an abuser. If some one needs space give them space.

"" Women are socially disadvantaged in controlling sexual access to their bodies through socialization to customs that define a woman's body as for sexual use by men. Sexual access is regularly forced or pressured or routinized beyond denial.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

“If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home for if a woman cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere.”
― Aysha Taryam

“Women face an uphill battle, from sexism and violence to inequality. In some areas, they are forced to deal with a culture that promotes primitive practices that endanger them, not just physically, but emotionally as well.”

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0

Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic and extrem women hating Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

We must say it clear and that vilonce is like a big flood worldwide, destroying everything and mostly destroying the female humanity:The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment and sexual witch hunts connected with stalking, rape, murder, defamation, snuff porns and sex slavery!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Caged Eyes: An Air Force Cadet's Story of Rape and Resilience /Lynn K. Hall (Autor)
An insider’s account of misogyny and rape in the US military and her extraordinary path to recovery and activism
Desperate to realize her childhood dream of being an astronaut, Lynn K. Hall was an enthusiastic young cadet. For Hall, the military offered an escape from her chaotic home—her erratic mother, absent biological father, and a man she called “dad” who sexually abused her. Resolute and committed to the Air Force Academy, Hall survived the ordeals of a first-year cadet: intense hazing from upperclassmen, grueling physical training, and demanding coursework. But she’s dismissed from the Academy when, after being raped by an upperclassman and contracting herpes, she is diagnosed with meningitis and left with chronic and debilitating pain.
Betrayed by the Academy and overcome with shame, Hall candidly recounts her loss of self, the dissociation from her body and the forfeiture of her individuality as a result of the military’s demands and her perpetrator’s abuse. Forced to leave the military and return to the civilian world, Hall turns to extreme sports to cope with and overcome PTSD and chronic pain. She, in turn, reclaims herself on the mountain trails of the Colorado Rockies.
An intimate account of grappling with shame and a misogynistic culture that condones rape and blames victims, Caged Eyes is also a transformative story of how it’s possible to help yourself and others in the aftermath of a profound injustice.

Stolen Girls: Survivors of Boko Haram Tell Their Stor/ Wolfgang Bauer
One night in April 2014, members of the terrorist organization Boko Haram raided the small town of Chibok in northeast Nigeria and abducted 276 young girls from the local boarding school. The event caused massive, international outrage. Using the hashtag “Bring Back Our Girls,” politicians, activists, and celebrities from all around the world―among them First Lady Michelle Obama and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai―protested.
Some of the girls were able to escape and award-winning journalist Wolfgang Bauer spent several weeks with them as they recounted their ordeal. In Stolen Girls, he gives voice to these girls, allowing them to speak for themselves―about their lives before the abduction, about the horrors during their captivity, and their dreams of a better future. Bauer's reportage is complemented by over a dozen stunning portraits by award-winning photographer Andy Spyra.
Bauer also examines the historical and political background of the Islamist terror in the heart of Africa, showing how Boko Haram works and describing the damage it has done to the fragile balance of ethnicities and cultures in one of the world's most diverse regions. His book tells a story of violence, fear, and uncertainty; it is also a story of hope, strength, and courage.

Highway of Tears: A True Story of Racism, Indifference, and the Pursuit of Justice for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls/Jessica McDiarmid (Autor)
For decades, Indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been found murdered along an isolated stretch of highway in northwestern British Columbia. The corridor is known as the Highway of Tears, and it has come to symbolize a national crisis.
Journalist Jessica McDiarmid meticulously investigates the devastating effect these tragedies have had on the families of the victims and their communities, and how systemic racism and indifference have created a climate in which Indigenous women and girls are overpoliced yet underprotected. McDiarmid interviews those closest to the victims—mothers and fathers, siblings and friends—and provides an intimate firsthand account of their loss and unflagging fight for justice. Examining the historically fraught social and cultural tensions between settlers and Indigenous peoples in the region, McDiarmid links these cases to others across Canada—now estimated to number up to four thousand—contextualizing them within a broader examination of the undervaluing of Indigenous lives in the country.
Highway of Tears is a piercing exploration of our ongoing failure to provide justice for the victims and a testament to their families’ and communities’ unwavering determination to find it.

Honour: Achieving Justice for Banaz Mahmod/Caroline Goode (Autor)
When Rahmat Sulemani reported his girlfriend Banaz missing, it quickly became clear to DCI Caroline Goode that something was very wrong. In fact, Banaz had contacted her local police station multiple times before, even listing the names of the men she expected to murder her in a so-called honour killing. Her parents didn't seem worried about her whereabouts, but Banaz had already accused them of being in on the conspiracy.
DCI Goode's homicide team took on the investigation before they even had proof that a murder had taken place. What emerged was a shocking story of betrayal and a community-wide web of lies, which would take the team from the suburban streets of south London to the mountain ranges of Kurdistan, making covert recordings and piecing together cell phone data to honour Banaz's memory and finally bring the killers to justice.

The Steubenville Rape Case: Social Media Evidence/ Alexandria Goddard (Autor)
In August 2012, high school football players from Steubenville High School in Steubenville, Ohio were charged with rape. The case made international news because the students documented the crime on social media and no one that night did anything to help the victim. Instead, tweet after tweet they shared humiliating commentary and made fun of her. This book contains screenshots of social media evidence that was collected weeks after the crime as well as tweets that relate to a rape that occurred in April 2012. Again, no one helped the victims. Instead, students and teachers laughed and made jokes.

The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State/Nadia Murad (Autor)
Nadia Murad was born and raised in Kocho, a small village of farmers and shepherds in northern Iraq. A member of the Yazidi community, she and her brothers and sisters lived a quiet life. Nadia had dreams of becoming a history teacher or opening her own beauty salon.
On August 15th, 2014, when Nadia was just twenty-one years old, this life ended. Islamic State militants massacred the people of her village, executing men who refused to convert to Islam and women too old to become sex slaves. Six of Nadia’s brothers were killed, and her mother soon after, their bodies swept into mass graves. Nadia was taken to Mosul and forced, along with thousands of other Yazidi girls, into the ISIS slave trade.
Nadia would be held captive by several militants and repeatedly raped and beaten. Finally, she managed a narrow escape through the streets of Mosul, finding shelter in the home of a Sunni Muslim family whose eldest son risked his life to smuggle her to safety.
Today, Nadia's story—as a witness to the Islamic State's brutality, a survivor of rape, a refugee, a Yazidi—has forced the world to pay attention to an ongoing genocide. It is a call to action, a testament to the human will to survive, and a love letter to a lost country, a fragile community, and a family torn apart by war.

Segrave, K: Lynchings of Women in the United States: The Recorded Cases, 1851-1946/Kerry Segrave (Autor)
Between 1850 and 1950, at least 115 women were lynched by mobs in the United States. The majority of these women were black. This book examines the phenomenon of the lynching of women, a much more rare occurence than the lynching of men. Over the same hundred year period covered in this text, more than 1,000 white men were lynched, while thousands of black men were murdered by mobs. Of particular importance in this examination is the role of race in lynching, particularly the increase in the number of lynchings of black women as the century progressed. Details are provided--when available--in an attempt to shine a light on this form of deadly mob violence.

The Natashas: The Horrific Inside Story of Slavery, Rape, and Murder in the Global Sex Trade/Victor Malarek (Autor)
On the black market, they’re the third most profitable commodity, after illegal weapons and drugs. The only difference is that these goods are human, to their handlers they are wholly expendable. They are women and girls, some as young as twelve, from all over the Eastern Bloc, where sinister networks of organized crime have become entrenched in the aftermath of the collapse of the Communist regimes.
In Israel, they’re called Natashas, whether they’re actually from Russia, Bosnia, the Czech Republic, or Ukraine. Lured into vans and onto airplanes with promises of jobs as waitresses, models, nannies, dishwashers, maids, and dancers, they are then stripped of their identification, and their brutal nightmare begins. They are sold into prostitution and kept enslaved; those who resist are beaten, raped, and sometimes killed. They often have nowhere to turn. In many cases, the men who should be rescuing them—immigration officials, police officers, or international peacekeepers—are among their most hostile aggressors. The worldwide traffic in human beings is already a crisis of epic proportions, and it continues to grow. Victor Malarek here exposes the global phenomenon of sexual trafficking, a form of twenty-first century slavery and a multibillion-dollar industry whose scope has, until now, remained largely unknown. The Natashas is an indispensable and startling call to action to seek out institutional corruption and to put a stop to this heinous crime against humanity.

In Fear of Her Life: The True Story of a Violent Marriage/Frances Smyth (Autor)
Frances Smith is the pseudonym for a woman who lived in fear of her life for 22 years. Married at 16 to a Dublin criminal, she endured years of relentless mental and physical torture until she found the strength to fight back.
This is her courageous story told with brutal honesty and at times humour. It chronicles her descent to the brink of suicide and consequent rebuilding of her life.
This unique account is essential reading for all those who have ever endured cruelty at the hands of a man, or another human being for that matter. It gives hope to all those who have been victimised.

One day she found the courage to change the locks, seek a divorce and let his mistress have him for keeps. It was then that she realised he meant the vows he took on his wedding day - 'Till death do us part…'
This is a inspirational story and unless you are a victim, or was a victim of domestic violence, it is never easy to understand why we put up with this abuse.",0,0,Event,25699929,0,comment,2021-04-29 05:46:26+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],warner-bros-bring-back-johnny-depp-as-grindelwald,warner-bros-bring-back-johnny-depp-as-grindelwald_limit_1,against

“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency plan and has demonstrated her ability to carry it out, she remains in danger of repeated abuse.”

"" Men, permitted to put words (and other things) in women's mouths, create scenes in which women desperately want to be bound, battered, tortured, humiliated, and killed.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

“It is not a single crime when a child is photographed while sexually assaulted (raped.) It is a life time crime that should have life time punishments attached to it. If the surviving child is, more often than not, going to suffer for life for the crime(s) committed against them, shouldn't the pedophiles suffer just as long? If it often takes decades for survivors to come to terms with exactly how much damage was caused to them, why are there time limits for prosecution?”
― Sierra D. Waters, Debbie

“The rape of a child is a violent act of contempt, not an expression of sexuality or affection.”
― Mike Lew, Gay Men and Childhood Sexual Trauma

""We are very close to death. All women are. And we are very close to rape and we are very close to beating. And we are inside a system of humiliation from which there is no escape for us. We use statistics not to try to quantify the injuries, but to convince the world that those injuries even exist. Those statistics are not abstractions. It is easy to say, Ah, the statistics, somebody writes them up one way and somebody writes them up another way. That’s true. But I hear about the rapes one by one by one by one by one, which is also how they happen. Those statistics are not abstract to me. Every three minutes a woman is being raped. Every eighteen seconds a woman is being beaten. There is nothing abstract about it. It is happening right now as I am speaking.""
-Andrea Dworkin

"" Women are socially disadvantaged in controlling sexual access to their bodies through socialization to customs that define a woman's body as for sexual use by men. Sexual access is regularly forced or pressured or routinized beyond denial.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

""All sex, even consensual sex between a married couple, is an act of violence perpetrated against a woman.""
-Catharine MacKinnon

What causes misogynistic thinking? New study finds link with early exposure to pornography !
Have you encountered a man with a sexist attitude? His introduction to pornography could be the stem, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of Nebraska, U.S., conducted an experiment to determine how exposure to porn for the first time could shape a man’s views on masculinity and sexuality.

To do so, they handed out a 46-question survey to 330 undergraduate men ages 17 to 54. It was designed to measure masculine norms, and it included questions about the first time males saw pornography and whether or not it was an accident.

On average, respondents said they were about 13 years old when they were first exposed to pornography. More than 43 percent said it was by accident, 33 percent said they sought it out and 17 percent said they were forced. About 6 percent declined to answer.

After analyzing the data, scientists found that men who were exposed to porn for the first time at a younger age mostly agreed with statements that asserted male superiority.

However, those who were older when they were first exposed to pornography and had a “greater endorsement of Playboy masculine norms,” such as having multiple sexual partners.

“We expected that the younger the boys were when first exposed to pornography, the more likely they were to adopt playboy norms as well as norms of masculine power over women,” researcher Alyssa Bischmann said in a statement. “We don’t have a lot of theories that would explain this unexpected inverse relationship between pornography use and playboy norms.”However, the scientists did note that their experiment didn’t identify other factors, such as negative sexual experiences, performance anxiety, religiosity and frequency of use, which could be related to the surprising results.

Therefore, more research is needed.

“Future research,” the study said, “should also investigate outcomes of these relations by including measures of relationship satisfaction, wellbeing, and perpetration of violence against women, as these variables may be related to masculine norms and pornography.”

Pornography is the instruction to rape, sexual torture and murder and sexual femicide! There is not only fantasy in porns, there is the real humilation, rape, torture, mutilation and sometimes murder of women, girls and childs. That are heinous sex crimes, nothing more and nothing less.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0
Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 16 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k.

The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.

The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality/ Judith Giesberg (Author)
Civil War soldiers enjoyed unprecedented access to obscene materials of all sorts, including mass-produced erotic fiction, cartes de visite, playing cards, and stereographs. A perfect storm of antebellum legal, technological, and commercial developments, coupled with the concentration of men fed into armies, created a demand for, and a deluge of, pornography in the military camps. Illicit materials entered in haversacks, through the mail, or from sutlers; soldiers found pornography discarded on the ground, and civilians discovered it in abandoned camps. Though few examples survived the war, these materials raised sharp concerns among reformers and lawmakers, who launched campaigns to combat it. By the war's end, a victorious, resurgent American nation-state sought to assert its moral authority by redefining human relations of the most intimate sort, including the regulation of sex and reproduction—most evident in the Comstock laws, a federal law and a series of state measures outlawing pornography, contraception, and abortion. With this book, Judith Giesberg has written the first serious study of the erotica and pornography that nineteenth-century American soldiers read and shared and links them to the postwar reaction to pornography and to debates about the future of sex and marriage.

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Gender Trolling: How Misogyny Went Viral / Karla Mantilla
Mantilla provides a thoughtful and thorough framework for understanding gender specific harassment and its relationship to broader ""real life"" gender-based abuses of women. She ties online threats and sexual harassment to intimate partner abuse, street harassment, workplace sexual harassment and rape and recommends structural, legal and corporate approaches to increasing women’s safety and free speech online.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Stand Up to Sexting: An Open Conversation for Parents and Tweens/Christy Monson (Author), Heather Boynton (Author),
Sexting-the texting of nude or sexually suggestive images to another person-has become so commonplace that nearly 1 in 4 teens admits to being a participant. The problem is, sexting destroys self-esteem, undermines healthy relationships, leads to depression and self-harm, and can even result to run-ins with the law. It's no wonder that parents recently put sexting among their top-3 parenting concerns-but what's a parent to do?
Stand Up to Sexting is the essential guidebook for parents and tweens to having an open, relaxed conversation about the dangers of sexting. Written in miniature chapters, the book includes friendly illustrations, Q&A prompts for easy conversations, and tools for staying safe. Designed for tweens ages 10-13, the book is the perfect preemptive tool for preparing your kids before their teen years strike.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls /Carrie Goldberg (Author)
Nobody's Victim is an unflinching look at a hidden world most people don’t know exists—one of stalking, blackmail, and sexual violence, online and off—and the incredible story of how one lawyer, determined to fight back, turned her own hell into a revolution.
“We are all a moment away from having our life overtaken by somebody hell-bent on our destruction.” That grim reality—gleaned from personal experience and twenty years of trauma work—is a fundamental principle of Carrie Goldberg’s cutting-edge victims’ rights law firm.
Riveting and an essential timely conversation-starter, Nobody's Victim invites readers to join Carrie on the front lines of the war against sexual violence and privacy violations as she fights for revenge porn and sextortion laws, uncovers major Title IX violations, and sues the hell out of tech companies, schools, and powerful sexual predators. Her battleground is the courtroom; her crusade is to transform clients from victims into warriors.
In gripping detail, Carrie shares the diabolical ways her clients are attacked and how she, through her unique combination of advocacy, badass relentlessness, risk-taking, and client-empowerment, pursues justice for them all. There are stories about a woman whose ex-boyfriend made fake bomb threats in her name and caused a national panic; a fifteen-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted on school grounds and then suspended when she reported the attack; and a man whose ex-boyfriend used a dating app to send more than 1,200 men to ex's home and work for sex. With breathtaking honesty, Carrie also shares her own shattering story about why she began her work and the uphill battle of building a business.
While her clients are a diverse group—from every gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race, religion, occupation, and background—the offenders are not. They are highly predictable. In this book, Carrie offers a taxonomy of the four types of offenders she encounters most often at her firm: assholes, psychos, pervs, and trolls. “If we recognize the patterns of these perpetrators,” she explains, “we know how to fight back.”
Deeply personal yet achingly universal, Nobody's Victim is a bold and much-needed analysis of victim protection in the era of the Internet. This book is an urgent warning of a coming crisis, a predictor of imminent danger, and a weapon to take back control and protect ourselves—both online and off.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Author)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don’t know we’re seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths―that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

Know My Name: A Memoir/Chanel Miller (Author)
She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

Violence against Women in Pornography/ Walter DeKeseredy (Author), Marilyn Corsianos (Author)
Violence against Women in Pornography illuminates the ways in which adult pornography hurts many women, both on and off screen. A growing body of social scientific knowledge shows that it is strongly associated with various types of violence against women in intimate relationships. Many women who try to leave abusive and/or patriarchal men also report that pornography plays a role in the abuse inflicted on them by their ex-partners. On top of these harms, male pornography consumption is strongly correlated with attitudes supporting violence against women. Many researchers, practitioners, and policy makers believe that adult pornography is a major problem and offer substantial evidence supporting this claim.
Violence against Women in Pornography, unlike books written mainly for scholarly and general audiences, specifically targets students enrolled in undergraduate criminology, deviance, women’s studies, masculinities studies, human sexuality, and media studies courses. Thoughtful discussion questions are placed at the end of each chapter, and appropriate PowerPoint slides and suggestions for classroom exercises will be available to aid student understanding. The main objective of this book is to motivate readers to think critically about adult pornography and to take progressive steps individually and collectively to curb the production and consumption of hurtful sexual media, including that from the ""dark side of the Internet.""

Female Mutilation: The Truth Behind the Horrifying Global Practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Hilary Burrage (Author)
The numbers of girls and women affected around the world are staggering. Death is not an uncommon outcome.

This book covers this controversial cultural practice that is taking place around the world including in Western countries where it is illegal. Read the harrowing stories of women who have been genitally mutilated, their accounts of survival and their determination to end this injustice. Find out what is being done to combat this crime against women from those committed to see change.

When Katie Piper was 24, her life was near perfect. Young and beautiful, she was well on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming a model.
But then she met Daniel Lynch on Facebook and her world quickly turned into a nightmare ...

FATWA: Hunted in America/Pamela Geller (Author)
In FATWA: Hunted in America, Geller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller's Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa issued to her and plot to behead her; and much more including the relentless vilification from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.
""It's my story, but it's every story,"" Geller concludes. ""Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible long war: what has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.""
Yet - as shown in this book - she has prevailed. Without Pamela Geller, there would be a 16-story mega-mosque at Ground Zero today. Without Pamela Geller, untold numbers of young women who are living free today would instead have been victims of honor killing. Without Pamela Geller, countless numbers of indefatigable fighters for freedom would have been cowed and intimidated into silence by an increasingly violent and authoritarian Left.

Honour Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed/ Ayse Onal (Author)
Honour killing persists around the Middle East, where regimes refrain from tackling primitive traditions for fear of sparking unrest. Ayse Onal interviewed imprisoned men in Turkey convicted of killing their mothers, sisters, and daughters. The result is a revealing and ultimately tragic account of ruined lives - both the victims' and the killers' - in a country where state and religion conspire to hush up the killing of hundreds of women every year. 'Ayse Onal has done an immense service by revealing what it is like to live in an honour-based society and the terrible cost, not just to the women who are beaten and eventually killed, but to the perpetrators and other relatives.' -- Joan Smith.

When Rape Becomes Acceptable: Corrective Rape in Jamaica /Kemone S.G. Brown (Author)
What would you do if your body had been violated? Would you have the will, the energy, and the drive to survive? What if the person who violated you believed that he was doing the right thing? After all, society had provided him with reasoning for his beliefs. What would you do if someone threatened to rape you and you had nowhere or no one to turn to, no one or system to protect you? “When Rape Becomes Acceptable” deals with the issues surrounding corrective rape in Jamaica. It follows the lives of ten women who were victims of corrective rape and illustrates how each woman or her loved ones is dealing with what happened. Some of these women had the will to survive, not in the sense that they are flourishing, but they continue to live, hiding in the shadows, hiding from society who they really are; the fear of being outed again and being subjected to another instance of “corrective rape” determining how they live their lives. However, some of them were not so “lucky”. They didn’t have the strength to deal with or come to grips with what happened to them, so instead of having to bear the burden of what happened, they decided to end the pain and the agony as it was much easier than continuing to live. Join them as each woman tells you her story and opens up her life, her scars, her pain, her suffering as she tries to cope in a society that has not only failed to protect her but has also given rise to the violation of her body.

I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced/Nujood Ali (Author)
“I’m a simple village girl who has always obeyed the orders of my father and brothers. Since forever, I have learned to say yes to everything. Today I have decided to say no.”
Nujood Ali's childhood came to an abrupt end in 2008 when her father arranged for her to be married to a man three times her age. With harrowing directness, Nujood tells of abuse at her husband's hands and of her daring escape. With the help of local advocates and the press, Nujood obtained her freedom—an extraordinary achievement in Yemen, where almost half of all girls are married under the legal age. Nujood's courageous defiance of both Yemeni customs and her own family has inspired other young girls in the Middle East to challenge their marriages.
Hers is an unforgettable story of tragedy, triumph, and courage.

The Sadist, the Hitman and the Murder of Jane Bashara/George Hunter (Author),Lynn Rosenthal (Author)
""Big Bob"" Bashara put on a respectable face. To his friends in Detroit's affluent suburb of Grosse Pointe, he was a married father of two, Rotary Club President, church usher and soccer dad who organized charity events with his wife, Jane.
To his ""slaves,"" he was ""Master Bob,"" a cocaine-snorting slumlord who operated a sex dungeon and had a submissive girlfriend to do his bidding--and he wanted more slaves to serve him.

The true story about a narcisstic sadist and his victims. And the sad truth ist, he is only one of many, many one. We don't look behind the kind faces of husbands, priests, neighbours, fathers, friends, college students, lawyers and so one, behind the charming masks of people, so evil that the devil must run away, if he must meet them.

Our Bodies, Their Battlefields: War Through the Lives of Women /Christina Lamb (Author
From Christina Lamb, the coauthor of the bestselling I Am Malala and an award-winning journalist—an essential, groundbreaking examination of how women exerience war. In Our Bodies, Their Battlefields, longtime intrepid war correspondent Christina Lamb makes us witness to the lives of women in wartime. An award-winning war correspondent for twenty-five years (she’s never had a female editor) Lamb reports two wars—the “bang-bang” war and the story of how the people behind the lines live and survive. At the same time, since men usually act as the fighters, women are rarely interviewed about their experience of wartime, other than as grieving widows and mothers, though their experience is markedly different from that of the men involved in battle.
Lamb chronicles extraordinary tragedy and challenges in the lives of women in wartime. And none is more devastating than the increase of the use of rape as a weapon of war. Visiting warzones including the Congo, Rwanda, Nigeria, Bosnia, and Iraq, and spending time with the Rohingya fleeing Myanmar, she records the harrowing stories of survivors, from Yazidi girls kept as sex slaves by ISIS fighters and the beekeeper risking his life to rescue them; to the thousands of schoolgirls abducted across northern Nigeria by Boko Haram, to the Congolese gynecologist who stitches up more rape victims than anyone on earth. Told as a journey, and structured by country, Our Bodies, Their Battlefields gives these women voice.
We have made significant progress in international women’s rights, but across the world women are victimized by wartime atrocities that are rarely recorded, much less punished. The first ever prosecution for war rape was in 1997 and there have been remarkably few convictions since, as if rape doesn’t matter in the reckoning of war, only killing. Some courageous women in countries around the world are taking things in their own hands, hunting down the war criminals themselves, trying to trap them through Facebook.
In this profoundly important book, Christina Lamb shines a light on some of the darkest parts of the human experience—so that we might find a new way forward. Our Bodies, Their Battlefields is as inspiring and empowering is as it is urgent, a clarion call for necessary change.

Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching / Crystal N. Feimster (Author) 
Between 1880 and 1930, close to 200 women were murdered by lynch mobs in the American South. Many more were tarred and feathered, burned, whipped, or raped. In this brutal world of white supremacist politics and patriarchy, a world violently divided by race, gender, and class, black and white women defended themselves and challenged the male power brokers. Crystal Feimster breaks new ground in her story of the racial politics of the postbellum South by focusing on the volatile issue of sexual violence.
Pairing the lives of two Southern women―Ida B. Wells, who fearlessly branded lynching a white tool of political terror against southern blacks, and Rebecca Latimer Felton, who urged white men to prove their manhood by lynching black men accused of raping white women―Feimster makes visible the ways in which black and white women sought protection and political power in the New South. While Wells was black and Felton was white, both were journalists, temperance women, suffragists, and anti-rape activists. By placing their concerns at the center of southern politics, Feimster illuminates a critical and novel aspect of southern racial and sexual dynamics. Despite being on opposite sides of the lynching question, both Wells and Felton sought protection from sexual violence and political empowerment for women.
Southern Horrors provides a startling view into the Jim Crow South where the precarious and subordinate position of women linked black and white anti-rape activists together in fragile political alliances. It is a story that reveals how the complex drama of political power, race, and sex played out in the lives of Southern women.

Death in Salem: The Private Lives Behind The 1692 Witch Hunt / Diane Foulds (Author) 
Salem witchcraft will always have a magnetic pull on the American psyche. During the 1692 witch trials, more than 150 people were arrested. An estimated 25 million Americans—including author Diane Foulds—are descended from the twenty individuals executed. What happened to our ancestors? Death in Salem is the first book to take a clear-eyed look at this complex time, by examining the lives of the witch trial participants from a personal perspective.  
Massachusetts settlers led difficult lives; every player in the Salem drama endured hardships barely imaginable today. Mercy Short, one of the “bewitched” girls, watched as Indians butchered her parents; Puritan minister Cotton Mather outlived all but three of his fifteen children. Such tragedies shaped behavior and, as Foulds argues, ultimately played a part in the witch hunt’s outcome. A compelling “who’s who” to Salem witchcraft, Death in Salem profiles each of these historical personalities as it asks: Why was this person targeted?

Making a Killing: Femicide, Free Trade, and La Frontera/Alicia Gaspar de Alba (Editor)
Since 1993, more than five hundred women and girls have been murdered in Ciudad Juárez across the border from El Paso, Texas. At least a third have been sexually violated and mutilated as well. Thousands more have been reported missing and remain unaccounted for. The crimes have been poorly investigated and have gone unpunished and unresolved by Mexican authorities, thus creating an epidemic of misogynist violence on an increasingly globalized U.S.-Mexico border.
This book, the first anthology to focus exclusively on the Juárez femicides, as the crimes have come to be known, compiles several different scholarly ""interventions"" from diverse perspectives, including feminism, Marxism, critical race theory, semiotics, and textual analysis. Editor Alicia Gaspar de Alba shapes a multidisciplinary analytical framework for considering the interconnections between gender, violence, and the U.S.-Mexico border. The essays examine the social and cultural conditions that have led to the heinous victimization of women on the border—from globalization, free trade agreements, exploitative maquiladora working conditions, and border politics, to the sexist attitudes that pervade the social discourse about the victims. The book also explores the evolving social movement that has been created by NGOs, mothers' organizing efforts, and other grassroots forms of activism related to the crimes. Contributors include U.S. and Mexican scholars and activists, as well as personal testimonies of two mothers of femicide victims.

A Killer's Confession: How I Brought My Daughter’s Murderer to Justice /
Karen Edwards (Author)
A mother's fight to bring her daughter's killer, Christopher Halliwell, to justice
'I have lived every parent's worst nightmare. On what would have been my daughter's 29th birthday, Detective Superintendent Stephen Fulcher knocked on the door and told me my beautiful Becky was dead. Found buried in a shallow grave in a remote field, Becky had been brutally murdered.'
When Becky Godden-Edwards was killed, her mother Karen awoke to a world where the truth was never guaranteed; where taxi driver Christopher Halliwell got away with murder and the police officer who found her daughter was punished instead.
This is Karen's story. Despite unimaginable tragedy, her love for her daughter has been unbreakable: from her despair through Becky's troubled teenage years, to the agonising eight years when Becky was missing, and then the dramatic story of how a killer's confession led to a terrible discovery.
The one constant has been Karen's determination to fight for Becky, tirelessly campaigning for the truth about what happened to be heard and for Halliwell to face the consequences of his evil actions.
*The murders of Becky Godden-Edwards and Sian O'Callaghan will soon be the focus of major new ITV series A Confession starring Martin Freeman as Stephen Fulcher and Imelda Staunton as Karen Edwards*

You're the Only One I've Told: The Stories Behind Abortion /Meera Shah (Author)
""Moving, multifaceted, and deeply human...as eye-opening as it is compelling” —Cecile Richards, author of Make Trouble 
At a time where reproductive rights are at risk, these vital stories of diverse individuals serve as a reminder of the importance of empathy, finding community and motivating advocacy .
For a long time, when people asked Dr. Meera Shah, Chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, what she did, she would tell them she was a doctor and leave it at that. But when she started to be direct about her work as an abortion provider an interesting thing started to happen: one by one, people would confide that they'd had an abortion themselves. The refrain was often the same: You're the only one I've told. 
This book collects these stories as they've been told to Shah to humanize abortion and to combat myths that persist in the discourse that surrounds it. A wide range of ages, races, socioeconomic factors, and experiences shows that abortion always occurs in a unique context.  
Today, a healthcare issue that's so precious and foundational to reproductive, social, and economic freedom for millions of people is exploited by politicians who lack understanding or compassion about the context in which abortion occurs. Stories have the power to break down stigmas and help us to empathize with those whose experiences are unlike our own.  
A portion of proceeds will be donated to promote reproductive health access. 

100 Times: A Memoir of Sexism/Chavisa Woods (Author)
Shirley Jackson Award-winning author and three-time Lambda Finalist, Chavisa Woods presents one hundred personal stories of sexism, harassment, discrimination, and assault. Recounting her experiences with sexist discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence—beginning in childhood, through the present—Woods lays out clear and unflinching personal vignettes that build in intensity as the number of times grows. Individually, and especially taken as a whole, these stories amount to powerful proof that sexual violence and discrimination are never just one-time occurrences, but part of a constant battle all women face every day.
In these extraordinary pages, sexual violence and sexist discrimination occur regardless of age, in all spheres of society, in rural and urban areas alike, in the US and abroad, from Woods' youth through adulthood. Demonstrating how often people are conditioned to endure sexism and harassment, and how thoroughly men feel entitled to women’s spaces and bodies, 100 Times forces the reader to witness the myriad ways in which sexism and misogyny continuously shape women’s lives, and are built-in facets of our society.

For Laci: A Mother's Story of Love, Loss, and Justice /Sharon Rocha (Author)
Laci Rocha Peterson, 8 months pregnant, was last seen by her sister, Amy, in the late afternoon of December 23, 2002. She spoke to her mother, Sharon Rocha, at 8:30 p.m. that night. This would be the last time anyone from her immediate family ever spoke to her.
A search began which lasted an agonizing four months. Sadly, Laci Peterson and her son Conner were found dead on the shores of San Francisco Bay on April 18, 2003.
Her husband, Scott, was eventually arrested and charged with the murder of Laci and Connor. After a sensational, media-saturated trial, Peterson was found guilty of capital murder and was sentenced to death on March 16, 2005.
This book deals with the story in three separate sections: first, Sharon describes the ordinary, loving life her daughter led, including fond memories of her childhood and adolescence. Second, it covers her marriage, disappearance, the community's moving search for her, and her and Connor's eventual recovery from San Francisco Bay. Third, it tells the story of the trial in detail not before revealed. Sharon will also talk about victim's rights, a subject on which she now campaigns regularly.

We Are the Murder Victims Who Lived: A Survivor’s Truth on Sexual Assault /S.K. Menelle (Author)
“We Are the Murder Victims Who Lived” is a gritty and grimy memoir written in the first person, which tackles the surviving of sexual assault while offering hope on life after. It also glimpses into the struggles and shames of life lived during, and a reminiscence on the innocence of life led before. This book serves as a beacon of hope to survivors of sexual assault as well as a wake-up call for a society blinded by darkness. The book targets audiences of every age and gender and sexual orientation, presenting itself as a safe zone specifically for women, a comfort for those previously affected by sexual violence, assault, and abuse. It is also written for those who are trying to understand what has happened to their loved ones, navigating through the unknown. It is an education in the horrors of sexual assault, a spit in the face of the writer’s very own rapist. It paves its way as a testimony to the power of good people. It is an education in the phases that survivors of sexual assault face: denial, hate, hiding, shame, and fear, which then lends itself to hopefulness, unbounding love, and truth. It is a plea for people to listen, forcing us to look at the ways in which we view sex and relationships, and consider whether we will raise our very own sons from boys to men--or from boys to rapists.

Chinese Comfort Women: Testimonies from Imperial Japan's Sex Slaves/Peipei Qiu (Author)
During the Asia-Pacific War, the Japanese military forced hundreds of thousands of women across Asia into ""comfort stations"" where they were repeatedly raped and tortured. Japanese imperial forces claimed they recruited women to join these stations in order to prevent the mass rape of local women and the spread of venereal disease among soldiers. In reality, these women were kidnapped and coerced into sexual slavery. Comfort stations institutionalized rape, and these ""comfort women"" were subjected to atrocities that have only recently become the subject of international debate.
Comfort women, also called military comfort women, Japanese jūgun ianfu, a euphemism for women who provided sexual services to Japanese Imperial Army troops during Japan’s militaristic period that ended with World War II and who gen",0,0,Event,25706552,0,comment,2021-02-12 09:11:57+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],warner-brothers-i-would-like-for-amber-heard-to-be-removed-from-warner-bros-for-assaulting-johnny-depp,warner-brothers-i-would-like-for-amber-heard-to-be-removed-from-warner-bros-for-assaulting-johnny-depp_limit_1,against

815977057,"“Every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is, although we didn’t have a name for it.”
“Feminism is the notion that we should each be free to develop our own talents and not be held back by man made barriers.”
-Ruth Ginsburg

We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as I will show with my cases and examples, of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, namely my inhuman violent sexually sadistic brother-in-law and my hateful sexually perverse and extremely manipulative ex-tenant.
Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.

These are my shocking experiences:.

First I was and I am a honest girl and woman, hard working at school, High School and Workplace. Goodlooking and with no sexy dresses. A hardworking wife and mother, fighting for women's rights, girls and childrens rights and human rights, for animal rights and for a clean and good environment. I am a very careful person. But inspite of this, I met many psychopaths and evil persons. Nobody is an island of safety and nobody can say, that evil things cannot crosssing the way of life, every day and every time:


The cases I'll describe in more detail!

Here is a short overview!

I was hunted and stalked on the way to school by a traveling salesman from the area of Aachen at the age of 8 to 10 years for two years by the car. Female neighbors who had seen from the window, that a anonymous car was chasing me, said viciously laughing to my shocked old grandmother, that I was a little slut, if that would already start with men and cars, then I would eventually end up on the street prostitution. None of these stupid and vicious women called the police or anyone else to help, though they saw that in my desperation I ran across the fields for my life. This thing ended with schoolmates and my former teacher, who ambushed the offender and expelled him, but I did not get any help from women.

In high school at the age of 17, I was massively harassed, terrorized and stalked by a classmate. There were female idiots in my class who thought I should finally sleep with him, so that calm would enter the class. It was known, that my harasser was an sexual sadist, because he was a great fan of the misogynist films, ""The last Tango of Paris"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Some stupid girls said, that I am an impertinence with my resistance for the whole class. Because of the fact, the stalker had girl friends in the class, it was planned, that these girls should lure me to a party where I would then be put forcefully under alcohol and drugs and he wanted to gang rape me with numerous friendsn, male classmates warned me, from the concerned girls no warning came. And when he tried every day to throw his heavy school backpack on my head for long-distance practice, which could have ended in a hit with serious or fatal injuries, male classmates intervened, some more than mindless girls were very amused over the show and thought that I should see it as casual fun. The help for me came by male classmates and a female subject teacher, one of the few women in my life that really helped me.
Later, when I had started training in another city, he was seen several times with unknown young men in my train compartment, where they passed me with a sneering smile, then another friend of him was one day suddenly in my company canteen, where he was looking menacingly and silently sat down at my table and also my classmate stalker and two male friends threw me one day powerfully an old umbrella from behind in my back in the main station, so that the umbrella broke. So much for the harmlessness of stalkers.

During my first year at the workplace at the age of 18, I became the victim of a rape attempt by a senior colleague. My successful resistance was dismissed as outrageous and unnormal, especially among stupid women who had gone to sleeping around to make carreer, they said if I was thinking to be anything better then the other women. These mindless women bullied me instead of supporting me. I have at that time the support of my boss and a another male collague. For me, it was not surprising that the harasser had an absolutely disgusting porn calender in his office and in my presence he was constantly talking about whether I could compete with these porn stars and show if I have such a figure. My complaints had the loud mocking laughter of the men and the indignation of the absolutely dumbfounded women to say that porn and prostitution were normal and would prevent rapes and only someone who was not right in the head, like me, would be bothered by this porn calender. However, as we learn from the media / criminal cases and crimonological and scientific studies on a daily basis, increasing pornography and prostitution since the sixties has led to worldwide sexual femicide in all countries, especially in Africa, Asia, South America and all Muslim countries/ Arab / Hindu countries. When at the birthday party of my boss a friend of the harasser massively sexually molested me so in that kind that I gave him a hard slap in the face and he wanted to beat me in front of all colleagues who participated with their family in the celebration, it was some men who intervened and helped me. These absolutely totally stupid women on the party said that I was the troublemaker and the wife of the boss had to drive me home to the indignation of the female guests. Mind you, not the harasser, a family man had to leave the celebration, but me. I was bullied for two more years by all horny men and silly women, sleeping around in this authority because of my resilience to the rape and sexual harassment that forced me to quit my civil service.

And when my ex-tenant stalked me at the age of 48 and terrorized to this day, there were very stupid women in the forum for stalking victims who sided with the stalker and called me a liar, and they were totally brainlessfemale friends of the stalker, who have bully me ever with anonymously calls, laughing at the phone and always sending me English-language love-couple reunion hotlines on my birthday and New Year's Eve. No trace of female solidarity, only of mockery and terror. Apparently it makes these stupid women happy to blame and bully the victims not the culprits. They were so silly, that they have not noticed, that my Ex-tenant has make many BDSM revenge porns of them, sending me these porns with anonymous E-Mails, calling all women and girls sluts. No comment to the stupity of these women and girls.

And at last one of greatest women haters of all:
My brother-in-law and half-brother of my husband, the super-bully and misogynist:
My brother-in-law, a wealthy and successful independent businessman, with mansions, houses at home and abroad, mobbed and terrorized everyone, invariably, but mostly women and girls. He was also still a domestic violent offender, who abused my first sister-in-law and his two children and he is always unpunished. Above all, he humiliated my husband without end. He stopped at no one. Whenever we had family reunions, he always came too late, we were not allowed to start drinking coffee he came, otherwise he was raging. His wife and children always came with blow marks, he constantly insulted me with sexually disgusting comments. I'm a very quick-witted and courageous person, I think, but I've been nearly assaulted by him on several occasions because I objected and stopped him. In one case he wanted to beat the children and his wife at the birthday table of my mother-in-law before my eyes. I intervened and he said he like beating a bitch like me. After everyone was dumbfounded and trembling with fear, I said, go ahead, I've always wanted to use the bonecrusher trick from my judo course on a living subject. And another time, he said to my mother-in-law's old girlfriends that such women as me he would meet otherwise only in brothels. Yes, I said, it has been rumored that you are the main customer in our city brothel, there was now a syphillis epidemic. The two old ladies were trembling all over and snow-white. My brother-in-law slandered me from the beginning ( I was at that time 18 years old), for example when I was in my parents' house with severe pneumonia and high fever, he claimed that he had seen me in the old town at late night with strange men and that I was a bitch. My parents didn't want to see him after that anymore. Or when I applied for an apprenticeship at the tax office, he called as my supposed husband there and said that he would forbid me to work there and that I was pregnant. And because of this lie, I didn't get the job.
He beat his first wife during the two pregnancies, he hated children, he forced my first sister-in-law to have three abortions in one year. He also terrorized and harassed the female employees in his tax advisor office. And he kept saying to everyone who wanted to hear it or not, women were only there to fuck and even for that they were too stupid!
He forced my second sister-in-law to sterilization during a holiday abroad, even though she was only 25 years old and definitely wanted children. Then he named her his free hooker. Before his first wedding, he took underaged girls to his room for sex and then literally chased them away saying that they were worthless whores.
My first sister-in-law found in his well-hidden documents before the divorce, evidence that he was constantly having sex with underaged girls abroad, but nobody wanted to get involved.
After a short time there was no contact with my brother-in-law until today. He verbally and physically terrorized and mistreated his female employees in a extreme way for very long years, a father of a underaged female trainee complained to me and my husband that his daughter had almost committed suicide, I could only point out that he must contact a lawyer and police, what else couldnot done. The brother of my husband deceived and decimated all his business associates and friends. They all complained to me and my husband too about this. At the end, the old parents were on the line, first my very ill old father-in-law, whom the brother of my husband accused in the hospital of being a simulant and that he was a case for the psychiatry. When I intervened, he terrorized my mother-in-law, telling her to ban me form visting the ill old man. He did not achieve that. When my father-in-law died, he bullied my seriously ill mother-in-law, along with his second wife, who had just married him for the money and was a true luxury female. When my mother-in-law, whom we cared for on her own, as well as for my father-in-law, although my brother-in-law had five minutes his office and his house away, became ill during our vacation, a female neighbor asked my brother-in-law for help. That was a goddamn mistake, because he pushed the poor old neighbour woman when he came almost down the stairs, screaming in rage, and my mother-in-law was forced by him and my sister-in-law to pack her things and the poor old woman was leave with their suitcases in tears in the doorway of a retirement home. In the meantime, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and playful grandson have looted my mother-in-law's account, along with the cleaning lady, sharing the most valuable stamps and coins from my father-in-law's collections, jewelry, and elegant clothing. When we got our mother-in-law out of the old people's home, the disaster had already happened. My mother-in-law threatened suicide if we went to the police. So she died completely broken in another modern retirement home, because it turned out that she had severe Alzheimer's. Before, my brother-in-law wrote two bad letters, we could take care of her now, he declines any responsibility. Well, evil exists, right.

The female betrayal of female victims is as old as the world. Because of this men worldwide call women dumb and inferior. The female betrayal includes bullying, slander, hate speech, psychoterror, abuse, violence, stalking, participation in FGM, child murder, abortion of female fetuses, femicide, forced marriages, childhood marriages, honor murder, dowry murder, sex murder, sexual torture, acid attacks, witch hunts, sex slavery, rape pornography, forced prostitution. Female treason also means excusing the perpetrators and accusing the victims. This is a worldwide disgrace and must have an end.
No wonder men around the world consider women for stupid and inferior. As long as women and girls behave so unsolidly and meanly, that will remain so.
If you are female and think you are safe at home, at school or at work, my experiences will teach you a better one!

I would advise all women, girls, and female children to learn self-defense and martial arts instead of learning to be beautiful and docile. Because the day could come when it saves their lives.

Later I deterred all the aggressors by telling them I practiced on a Grapfruit in a self-defense course, how to squeeze out the eyes of male aggressors.

I was stalked and hunted for two years with a car by a unknown man(a cowardly pervert) as I was a little school girl on my long and lonley school way. I was between 8 and 10 years old. He wanted to abduct me and rape me and perhaps kill me. All the time he cried out of the car, he has a little girl as me at home, I must fear nothing. In the back of his car, so I can see it, he had a notebook with female nude photos.The last time the man chased me with the car and tried to pull me in the car, I slammed the car door from the outside and clamped his arm in the car door and then ran away over fields, fields and scrub where he could not follow with the car. I saw on his hand a ring, he was married. He verbally abused me out of the car, called me a little slut and whore and threatened to kill me. Nevertheless, this behavior has saved me. Although the offender was tall and strong, I escaped. At that time, I was telling everything to my teacher and classmates which were trying to ambush the man to grab him. But he escaped. and was never seen again. He had still unsuccessfully addressed boys of my age in the village, but he had not hunted them like me. And these boys have noticed that he had an Aachen license plate and a case for traveling salesmen in the backseat. That said, this man was probably nationwide on the road and in my view, he could certainly have raped and killed children everywhere on his trips. No one could have proved it to him then, the DNA search did not exist at that time. What a perverse human pig!

I was bullied and stalked in college and at workplace. I was 17 year old. I got rape threats from a psychopathic classmate (a cowardly idiot). The classmate was an absolutely spoiled son of an innkeeper in Sulzbach an der Murr. When the classmate sexually insulted and scolded me in front of the whole class, I ripped him with his long hair over a bench and hit him with a ruler until it broke. That gave me respect, because he was a very strong and very tall young man. He had many girl friends all the time, changing them like T-Shirts and laughing about them and called them sluts and whores, but in spite of that, he harassed me. Classmates and a female teacher were speaking some hard words to him, after It told them, that this stalker want to rape me with others and was planing that. He defamed me in the whole school and called me a mad slut. What a heinous human pig! He left the school without passed exame. On a rainy night (I had already left school after passing the exam) he beheaded all the flowers and roses below my bedroom window and trampled all the beds in the garden with his very large shoes. The tracks could be seen the next morning. He made telephone terror together with other unknown guys for many years and drifted around the house at night. Destroyed all the flowers under my bedroom window on the ground floor at night and always showed with threatening looks at my station.

And at the workplace there was a rape attempt by a male boss (a cowardly dumb ass)I was 18 years old. At that time I had a limited internship in the building district of the German Federal Post Office in Fellbach. And here was sexual harassment on the agenda. But as a later female supervisor told me, I would be a shame for the whole post office because men are men, but my behavior to openly blame these men can not be excused. I have not heard a greater nonsense in my life. My supervisor gave me a lot of work unnecessarily, so I sat at it until the evening. When we were alone in the office, he came from behind, took me into a strangle hold and tried to throw me down and take off the sweater. I broke free with elbows and kicks, gave him a chin hook that sent him to the ground and then stepped on him. After that, I escaped. I was very angry because his pregnant wife was in the hospital and he bragged in the office, that he slept daily with another girl, they are all sluts and bitches. This offender was very strong, like a bulldog. I told everything to my other big boss and a male collegague. Both said very hard words to the culprit and threatend him with the police. The offender said, he invited me to a cup of coffee and then I got mad. And to others he said that I was a liar and a slut sleeping around. What a cowardly human pig! But they did not believe him. In spite of this I was bullied and harassed by others, because of that and so I terminated my job after three years for a better one.

I was stalked and harassed by an misogynist Muslim ex-tenant (a cowardly asshole) and his entire circle of friends. At that time I was 48 years old. There were damages to property, slander on the Internet, cybermobbing, telephone terror, rape threats and death threats. I got many sadistic rape porns and I was called a slut, which deserves rape. My husband e-mailed the tenant for his outrageous behavior, which then accused us of being liars and stalkers.
My husband reported the tenant on suspicion of terrorism because tenant had the behavior of a terrorist and friendships with very uncanny appropriate people.
Our ex-tenant told us that he was a student of the University of Melbourne and would do an internship at a famous firm in Stuttgart. At the time, I wondered why the university and the firm did not realize which real psychopath they were dealing with.


I think my ex-tenant is a very dangerous man who is capable of anything. Shortly before moving out, he was seen laughing and taking a gun at the head of his then-female acquaintance in a car below the house. At the same time, my husband informed me that the tenant had bought a sadistic porn on the same day, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleeding from me. We knew immediately what had happened. During his short thenant-time he had a girl friend and many One-Night-Stands, but in spite of that, he stalked me. And he defamed me in the neighbour hood as woman, that slept around. After the departure of the tenant informed me the very worried mother of a female tenant in the apartment above him that her daugther was probably drugged with drugs, raped and was now blackmailed. The mother of the female tenant must give her 24.000 €, the daughter said, she had to pay someone at once. But she said her mother not, who he was. Since the female tenant no longer talked to us and then moved out and probably no police turned on, we could unfortunately do nothing. Anonymous murder and rape threats to me were signed with Jack from Hell. I got a photo sent from the blowjob with about a twelve years old girl or younger, I recognized him on the liver spot and dimples on the chin, on the dark hair and the clothes. And I got anonymous many rape porns with E-Mail with calling me a dumb bitch and prostitute.
From a forum for stalking victims, I and all those who wanted to help me, were bullied out by him and other unknowns within a few days. I was no longer anonymous, because my appearance and my place of residence was described. A pen pal discovered a Bosnian forum where my tenant bragged that he was going to end the conflict with a woman with a bottle in her vagina, attached with a corresponding cruel X-ray image of such a crime. What a sadistic human pig! My tenant was a very tall and very strong man, when I realized that he was planning something evil when I was home alone one day, I invited my parents and let them park their car somewhere else. He came then and was very angry when I was not alone, he was sweating heavily, claiming that he wanted to pay me the rent cash today and pulled out a bundle of unbelievable many money , which seemed very strange to me. He is a masterful psychopathic liar, and capable of anything that I know to be evil.
There are also frequent incidents (during the rental period and even today after removal of the tenant) with nocturnal shots below the house, nocturnal destruction of a flower bank, flower pots, outdoor lamps, outdoor cameras, motion detectors, garden furniture in the garden, digging plants and stone steps at night Removal of the garbage containers or paper containers at night with removal of the contents, nightly damage to the company car (scratching, loosening the wheel nuts, piercing the tires).And until now we hear unknown men nightly around the house, under the house and the garden. A girlfriend of mine saw unknown foreign men in cars under the house nightly together with her friend, these people were driving always quickly away when they saw my girlfriend and her friend. Apart from the fact that he did not even pay his monthly newspaper and told the newspaper I would pay it.
Again and again, someone unknown goes around the house at night. When I threw hard fruit out of the skylight several times a night and hit the shadow, I heard from the sounds that it was a man.
Since my ex-tenant had intercepted mail from me during his tenancy and spied constantly in the paper container at night in discarded postal items, he came so to the addresses of girlfriends, penpals and colleagues. These people were massively harassed on the Internet and privately with telephone terror, property damages, break-ins and burglary attempts. A female friend of mine, who lived below my house, was molested by a whole unknown Arab clique (there were a burglary attempt and rape threats connected with harassment and telephone terror) until she threatened with the police. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, I saw this man again and again at longer intervals nearby, near the house, in the tram, the tram stop in my neighborhood, my workplace, near my girlfriend's apartment, either alone or together with an unknown man or an unknown woman, either in changing cars with different license plates or without a car. With beard, glasses, sunglasses or without. My son also saw him differently in the car parks near his school. When I saw him once in front of the shopping center of our district in the morning, my imitated photos were gone for 6 weeks. On a vacation and a cure, I had an unknown very big man at night on the balcony, which was also noticed by others. In addition, we had two private burglary attempts and a break-in attempt in our Austrian apartment and in a cure tried at night an unknown man to invade in my room. When a movie theater we visited, had to be evacuated because of a decaying, stinking dead animal that unknown people had left behind us, my son and his friend saw our ex-tenant with an unknown woman leaving the cinema. In addition, the ex-tenant repeatedly called me with false identities professionally and privately, so in the presence of my son in December 2015, when I was just was released from a serious tumor surgery from the hospital, my ex-tenant called himself Mr. Unterberg. At the hospital last night, an unknown tall, dark-haired man tried to get into my room, but he was expelled by a fellow female patient. The daughter of a female friend (who herself was exposed to several burglaries and harassment from a group of unknown foreign persons), was gangraped by unknown perpetrators and made a severely disabled. The perpetrators were never identified. The stalking of another girlfriend (Burglaries, harassment by unknown) was so extreme that she goes with her husband many times to the police, but the police could not find out everything, in all other cases it was the same.

Of course, all stalking operations also affected my commute and my workplace and all our office buildings. In the long time of stalking, I changed the departments several times and so did the buildings. Shortly after moving out of the ex-tenant we got a lot of virus mails, porno mails, funny and anonymous calls in the company. In addition, there were burglary attempts at my former workplace. But that was not all, as I later moved within the city in another company building, it started really. Burglaries and attempted burglaries were the order of the day in both company buildings, but our superiors made sure that nothing came out. In one case I was on vacation when all the offices were robbed and devastated, except my office and direct colleagues, which all found damn suspicious. Previously, I had noticed suspicious Arabs in the building who did not belong here, and on my report, my boss suspected me of racism. A little later, in the evening, my chief boss in another company building surprised the burglars and called the police, while the foreign dark-haired young offenders fled across the roof. He was banned by the top management to say anything, but he told me all about it. Once again someone smashed a massive glass door in the corridor in the evening while I was still working. Again nothing could be found out. In addition, someone tried in the evening to open forcefully the office space of another office building of the company when I was alone in the company with a blind female colleague. As a precaution, I had closed all the staircase and elevator entrances and doors, which saved us. My husband picked me up that evening and noticed suspicious lights above our floor from his car, lights from a floor that was actually empty at the time. Soon after, he saw a whole group of Arab suspicious young men furiously leaving the building. My blind colleague at the time was scared to death, but did not want that I call the police and left the building shivering with me over the elevator, where my husband was already was waiting very worried. In another case someone wanted to break into another office building with my female colleagues in the morning when I was on vacation. Completely hysterical, they called my boss, who forbade them to call the police for their paranoia. It is not surprising that this was my office space. Another time when I was on vacation as well, an elderly colleague unsuspectingly picked up my phone and heard an unknown man yell deadly death threats, including: I punch you in the skull, I'll kill you.
Since the caller called the whole day, the police were informed, which could only find out that the calls were made by a phone booth in Berlin. Everything was to be kept secret from me, yet my colleagues told me everything. Once again I silently talked to our male receptionist about the front desk when an unknown stocky Arab showed up at the glass door, made threatening gestures to us and wildly scolded him in Arabic. When the receptionist wanted to ask him what he was doing there, the culprit fled with a car. A few years after moving out of the tenant, I was twice persecuted in the morning on the way to work in the dark by a male stranger, who always remained in the dark and avoided the streetlights. It was strong male steps and a very big shadow. Did I stop, he stopped, when I went on, he wents on. The same happened twice on the way back, even in the dark in the evening. My husband, who was the meaning it was too dangerous for me, drove me to the tram and picked me up in the evening. About stalking was not spoken in my company. Despite all the incidents, the female persons who reported incidents were accused of paranoia. I was personally told that these are all coincidences that I should not overestimate. Much was also tried to keep secret from me.

I got and receive many phone calls from him with fake names, both professionally and privately. He called himself, for example, Mr. Unterberg, Kofi Annan, Johnny Cash, Johnnie Walker, Jim Beam. He also allegedly called on behalf of our insurance companies, our health insurance or a environment organization, where I was a member. Recalls from my husband and myself showed that no one from the insurance companies, the health insurance and environment organization had called us. He never disguised his voice and always laughed maliciously. I always recognized and identified him. In addition, we received uninterrupted anonymous letters and faxes that our relatives had died abroad. Unfortunately, I was also confronted with sadistic and misogynist pornography by this Muslim ex-tenant and stalker and his Islamist friends, in which they constantly sent me BDSM and shocking cruel gangbang pornos and news, especially by a porn producer from Munich, John Thompson, whose film studio became closed later due to incredible cruelty. My stalker and his friends told me that they would practice my planned rape gangbang as a porn supporter and porn statists with John Thompson. Porn producer, Reinhold B. (64) aka John Thompson expressed his pride in 2012 about his disgusting machinations, even if he had to sit in the court in 2010 for it.
What was filmed in his studios on Leopoldstrasse in the middle of Schwabing is, in fact, far beyond ""normal"" pornography: the films are extremely brutal rape! Women are being abused and humiliated. ""On his website,"" John Thompson ""constantly recruits young women:"" If you pass the casting, you start with 25 euros per hour (for gang rape and sexual torture at it's finest). Many of our models earn $ 1,000 a day. (for lifelong injuries on body and soul) ""What women paid for this gage reads like a horror script in the indictment: Bound women are raped by several men at the same time, they are beaten and spit, they become objects and hot candle wax, they are humiliated and literally pulled through the mud. All disgusting details are shown in close up.
Furthermore, during the stalking, I was confronted with sex trafficking and forced prostitution, in which the stalker and his friends told me that my real place was also in such a flat-rate brothel as, for example, in Fellbach near Stuttgart, here there were female sex slaves for almost nothing money and the women and girls would open their mouths only for blowjobs. Soon after that , various flatrate brothels were closed down for human trafficking and forced prostitution and unworthy conditions, as many girls and women had to spend a day with hundreds of suitors, entire buses of horny and sadistic men arrived to stage brutal gangbangs with young girls. After the perpetrators were convicted and the brothels were closed, it became known to the public that the young women were in poor health due to many untreated infections and injuries. Because of trafficking and pimping in so-called flat-rate brothels, two men and the female brothel chief from Fellbach became their punishment in court. The Stuttgart district court sent the defendants to jail for several years. The public has demanded much longer prison sentences for these criminals. From March 2008 to July 2009, they are said to have employed about 200 women and girls, some of them underaged in four brothels with low flat rates. For 100 to 200 euros , the women would have to spend a day available.
My meaning is, the male police means, that all the women are hysterical and implausible. I think nothing of the thesis that stalker are admirers and are harmless, I think this thesis simply idiotic and stupid and it was probably invented to protect these hate crime.

The unintelligible thing about the whole thing is, all Criminals, Mobbers and Stalkers had spectators, bystanders and helpers and people, which are looking away, also females. How can women and girls in this world be so stupid to be not on their own side?
I have therefore the opinion that the cowardly crimes stalking, bullying and rape are punished as hard as possible and that helpers, bystanders and spectators must be also severely punished.
Bullying and stalking, rape culture should not be more straightforward in the future. In cases where bullying and stalking leads to death or ends with rape, gang rape, sexual torture, murder and suicide, there should be high lifelong imprisonment for all parties, including helpers and spectators.

Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny/Kate Manne (Autor)
Misogyny is a hot topic, yet it's often misunderstood. What is misogyny, exactly? Who deserves to be called a misogynist? How does misogyny contrast with sexism, and why is it prone to persist - or increase - even when sexist gender roles are waning? This book is an exploration of misogyny in public life and politics by the moral philosopher and writer Kate Manne. It argues that misogyny should not be understood primarily in terms of the hatred or hostility some men feel toward all or most women. Rather, it's primarily about controlling, policing, punishing, and exiling the ""bad"" women who challenge male dominance. And it's compatible with rewarding ""the good ones,"" and singling out other women to serve as warnings to those who are out of order. It's also common for women to serve as scapegoats, be burned as witches, and treated as pariahs.
Manne examines recent and current events such as the Isla Vista killings by Elliot Rodger, the case of the convicted serial rapist Daniel Holtzclaw, who preyed on African-American women as a police officer in Oklahoma City, Rush Limbaugh's diatribe against Sandra Fluke, and the ""misogyny speech"" of Julia Gillard, then Prime Minister of Australia, which went viral on YouTube. The book shows how these events, among others, set the stage for the 2016 US presidential election. Not only was the misogyny leveled against Hillary Clinton predictable in both quantity and quality, Manne argues it was predictable that many people would be prepared to forgive and forget regarding Donald Trump's history of sexual assault and harassment. For this, Manne argues, is misogyny's oft-overlooked and equally pernicious underbelly: exonerating or showing ""himpathy"" for the comparatively privileged men who dominate, threaten, and silence women.

Gendertrolling: How Misogyny Went Viral/Karla Mantilla (Autor)
Gendertrolling arises out of the same misogyny that fuels other ""real life"" forms of harassment and abuse of women. This book explains this phenomenon, the way it can impact women's lives, and how it can be stopped.
 Combines the phenomenon of trolling and keen feminist insight to create a unique perspective on the treatment of women, male/female interaction, and online user interaction
 Demonstrates what online rape and death threats have in common with street harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace, domestic violence, and date rape, showing the serious, harmful nature of this practice

A Brief History of Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice (Brief Histories)/ Jack Holland (Autor)
In this compelling, powerful book, highly respected writer and commentator Jack Holland sets out to answer a daunting question: how do you explain the oppression and brutalization of half the world's population by the other half, throughout history?
The result takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through centuries, continents and civilizations as it looks at both historical and contemporary attitudes to women. Encompassing the Church, witch hunts, sexual theory, Nazism and pro-life campaigners, we arrive at today's developing world, where women are increasingly and disproportionately at risk because of radicalised religious belief, famine, war and disease. Well-informed and researched, highly readable and thought-provoking, this is no outmoded feminist polemic: it's a refreshingly straightforward investigation into an ancient, pervasive and enduring injustice. It deals with the fundamentals of human existence -- sex, love, violence -- that have shaped the lives of humans throughout history.
The answer? It's time to recognize that the treatment of women amounts to nothing less than an abuse of human rights on an unthinkable scale. A Brief History of Misogyny is an important and timely book that will make a long-lasting contribution to the efforts to improve those rights throughout the world.

Misogyny and Media in the Age of Trump (Communicating Gender)/
Maria B. Marron (Herausgeber)
This book explores misogyny across media ranging from political and editorial cartoons to news, sport, film, television, social media (especially Twitter), and journalistic organizations that address gender inequities.

Beyond Blurred Lines: Rape Culture in Popular Media/Nickie D Phillips (Autor)
Beyond Blurred Lines explores the ways that the concept of “rape culture” resonates in popular media. This book demonstrates that popular culture, mass media, and social media are prominent sites for understanding and responding to sexual violence.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Autor)
Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. And, as Gail Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. Proving that porn desensitizes and actually limits our sexual freedom, Dines argues its omnipresence is a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town/Jon Krakauer (Autor)
Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, home to a highly regarded state university whose beloved football team inspires a passionately loyal fan base. Between January 2008 and May 2012, hundreds of students reported sexual assaults to the local police. Few of the cases were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.
In these pages, acclaimed journalist Jon Krakauer investigates a spate of campus rapes that occurred in Missoula over a four-year period. Taking the town as a case study for a crime that is sadly prevalent throughout the nation, Krakauer documents the experiences of five victims: their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the skepticism directed at them by police, prosecutors, and the public; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them. These stories cut through abstract ideological debate about acquaintance rape to demonstrate that it does not happen because women are sending mixed signals or seeking attention. They are victims of a terrible crime, deserving of fairness from our justice system. Rigorously researched, rendered in incisive prose, Missoula stands as an essential call to action.

Fraternity Gang Rape: Sex, Brotherhood, and Privilege on Campus /Peggy Reeves Sanday (Autor)
This widely acclaimed and meticulously documented volume illustrates, in painstaking and disturbing detail, the nature of fraternity gang rape. Drawing on interviews with both victims and fraternity members, Peggy Reeves Sanday reconstructs daily life in the fraternity, highlighting the role played by pornography, male bonding, and degrading, often grotesque, initiation and hazing rituals.
In a substantial new introduction and afterword, Sanday updates the incidences of fraternity gang rape on college campuses today, highlighting such recent cases as that of Duke University and others in the headlines. Sanday also explores the nature of hazing at sororities on campus and how Greek life in general contributes to a culture which promotes the exploitation and sexual degradation of women on campus. More broadly, Sanday examines the nature of campus life today and the possibility of creating a rape-free campus culture.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Autor)
An award-winning journalist's intimate investigation of the true scope of domestic violence, revealing how the roots of America's most pressing social crises are buried in abuse that happens behind closed doors.
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don't know we're seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths-that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

See What You Made Me Do: Power, Control and Domestic Violence /Jess Hill (Autor)
""Women are abused or killed by their partners at astonishing rates- in Australia, almost 17 per cent of women over the age of fifteen - one in six - have been abused by an intimate partner. In this confronting and deeply researched account, journalist Jess Hill uncovers the ways in which abusers exert control in the darkest - and most intimate - ways imaginable. She asks- What do we know about perpetrators? Why is it so hard to leave? What does successful intervention look like? What emerges is not only a searing investigation of the violence so many women experience, but a dissection of how that violence can be enabled and reinforced by the judicial system we trust to protect us. Combining exhaustive research with riveting storytelling, See What You Made Me Do dismantles the flawed logic of victim-blaming and challenges everything you thought you knew about domestic and family violence.""--Publisher's description.

Stalkers and their Victims /Paul E. Mullen (Autor)
Stalking has moved from being a novel area for study to become a core area of concern for mental health professionals, lawyers and other members of the criminal justice system.

This new edition brings the reader completely up-to-date with the explosion in published research and clinical studies in the field, and covers new issues such as cyberstalking, stalking health professionals, stalking in the workplace, female stalkers, juvenile stalkers, stalking celebrities, evaluating risk in the stalking situation, as well as exploring changes to the legal status of the behaviour. Illustrated with case studies throughout, this is the definitive guide and reference for anyone with professional, academic or other interests in this complex behaviour.

Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online/ Bailey Poland (Autor)
Cybersexism is rampant and can exact an astonishingly high cost. In some cases, the final result is suicide.
Bullying, stalking, and trolling are just the beginning. Extreme examples such as GamerGate get publicized, but otherwise the online abuse of women is largely underreported. Haters combines a history of online sexism with suggestions for solutions.
Using current events and the latest available research into cybersexism, Bailey Poland questions the motivations behind cybersexist activities and explores methods to reduce footprints of Internet misogyny, drawing parallels between online and offline abuse. By exploring the cases of Alyssa Funke, Rehtaeh Parsons, Audrie Pott, Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu, and others, and her personal experiences with sexism, Poland develops a compelling method of combating sexism online.

Domestic Disturbances, Patriarchal Values/ Marianna Muravyeva (Herausgeber)
This book offers an in-depth analysis of several national case studies on family violence between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, using court records as their main source. It raises important questions for research on early modern Europe: the notion of absolute power; sovereignty and its applicability to familial power; the problem of violence and the possibility of its usage for conflict resolution both in public and private spaces; and the interconnection of gender and violence against women, reconsidered in the context of modern state formation as a public sphere and family building as a private sphere.
Contributors bring together detailed studies of domestic violence and spousal murder in Romania, England, and Russia, abduction and forced marriage in Poland, infanticide and violence against parents in Finland, and rape and violence against women in Germany. These case studies serve as the basis for a comparative analysis of forms, models, and patterns of violence within the family in the context of debates on political power, absolutism, and violence. They highlight changes towards unlimited violence by family patriarchs in European countries, in the context of the changing relationship between the state and its citizens. This book was originally published as a special issue of the Journal of the History of the Family.

Mass Rape: The War against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina/ Alexandra Stiglmayer (Herausgeber), Roy Gutman (Künstler), Marion Faber (Übersetzer)
Alexandra Stiglmayer interviewed survivors of the continuing war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to reveal, to a seemingly deaf world, the horrors of the ongoing war in the former Yugoslavia. The womenprimarily of Muslim but also of Croatian and Serbian originhave endured the atrocities of rape and the loss of loved ones. Their testimony, published in the 1993 German edition, is bare, direct, and its cumulative effect overwhelming.
The first English edition contains Stiglmayer's updates to her own two essays, one detailing the historical context of the current conflict and the other presenting the core of the book, interviews with some twenty victims of rape as well as interviews with three Serbian perpetrators. Essays investi-gating mass rape and war from ethnopsychological, sociological, cultural, and medical perspectives are included.
New essays by Catharine A. MacKinnon, Rhonda Copelon, and Susan Brownmiller address the crucial issues of recognizing the human rights of women and children. A foreword by Roy Gutman describes war crimes within the context of the UN Tribunal, and an afterword by Cynthia Enloe relates the mass rapes of this war to developments and reactions in the international women's movement.
Accounts of torture, murder, mutilation, abduction, sexual enslavement, and systematic attempts to impregnateall in the name of ""ethnic cleansing""make for the grimmest of reading. However brutal and appalling the information conveyed here, this book cannot and should not be ignored.

Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment/ Linda Hirshman (Autor)
The first history—incisive, witty, fascinating—of the fight against sexual harassment, from the author of the New York Times bestseller Sisters in Law
Linda Hirshman, acclaimed historian of social movements, delivers the sweeping story of the struggle leading up to #MeToo and beyond: from the first tales of workplace harassment percolating to the surface in the 1970s, to the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal—when liberal women largely forgave Clinton, giving men a free pass for two decades. Many liberals even resisted the movement to end rape on campus.
And yet, legal, political, and cultural efforts, often spearheaded by women of color, were quietly paving the way for the takedown of abusers and harassers. Reckoning delivers the stirring tale of a movement catching fire as pioneering women in the media exposed the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, women flooded the political landscape, and the walls of male privilege finally began to crack.

The Accuser: The True Story of the Big Dan's Gang Rape Victim/ Karen Curtis (Author)
Cheryl Ann Araujo is The Accuser. In 1983, she was victimized by men, the judicial system, the Government, the media, and the Portuguese mob because she stood up against them all in the Big Dan's rape trial in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
In 1988, Jodie Foster portrayed a character loosely based on Cheryl Araujo in the Hollywood movie The Accused for which she won an Academy Award. Foster's character was gang raped on a pinball machine, rather than a pool table.
But, by the time the movie was released Cheryl was already dead. After the rape trials, she was run out of Massachusetts due to death threats and in 1986, died in a single-car accident in South Florida. Her two young daughters were with her in the car and survived. They recall what happened that fateful day in this book.
This is the true story about what the government and Hollywood do not want you to know regarding one young woman's fight as an accuser to tell her true story to a jury and to the world without being ""victim blamed."" Cheryl was one of the first accusers to face a camera in the courtroom shaping the way the media and judicial system covers rape trials today. Her grueling experience also planted the first seeds of today's burgeoning #MeToo movement.
The book contains never before published information, interviews, and photographs about the life and death of Cheryl Araujo, one of the most tragic accusers and heroines in American history.

Burned Alive: A Survivor of an ""Honor Killing"" Speaks Out/Souad (Author) Marie-Therese Cuny (Collaborator)
When Souad was seventeen she fell in love. In her West Bank village, as in so many others, sex before marriage is considered a grave dishonor to one's family and is punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of meting out her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family's clothes, he poured gasoline over her and set her on fire. Miraculously, she survived, rescued by women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horribly burned over seventy percent of her body and still denounced by her family, Souad was able to receive the care she needed only after the intervention of a European aid worker. Now in permanent exile from her homeland, she has decided to tell her story and reveal the barbarity of a practice that continues to this day. Burned Alive ...is the first true account ever published by a victim of an ""honor crime."" Souad's inspiring testimony is a shocking, moving, and harrowing story of cruelty and incomparable courage...and an inspiring call to action to end a heinous tradition.

Being Reshma: The Extraordinary Story of an Acid-Attack Survivor who Took the World by Storm/ Reshma Qureshi (Author), Tania Singh (Author)
On 19 May 2014, as seventeen-year-old Reshma Qureshi left home for the examination centre, everything happened in a flash. The men rushed towards her. Grabbed her. Tugged at her hair.

Rising from from tragedy and suffering, Reshma soon made global headlines by becoming the first acid-attack survivor to walk the runway at the New York Fashion Week. Now an international anti-acid-sale activist, vlogger, model, and the face of Make Love Not Scars, Reshma works tirelessly towards empowering other acid-attack survivors like herself and has become a beacon of hope for millions. Inspiring and life-affirming, Being Reshma is the extraordinary story of this young girl from the slums of Mumbai, who overcame insurmountable odds in an unjust world and dared to change it.

Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women/ Kimberlé Crenshaw (Autor), Andrea J. Ritchie (Autor), Rachel Anspach (Autor), Rachel Gilmer (Autor), Luke Harris (Autor) 
To continue to call attention to police violence against Black women in the U.S., the African American Policy Forum, the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School, and Andrea Ritchie, Soros Justice Fellow and expert on policing of women and LGBT people of color, have put forth “Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women.” The document is intended to serve as a resource for the media, organizers, researchers, policy makers, and other stakeholders to better understand and address Black women’s experiences of profiling and policing. In addition to stories of Black women who have been killed by police and who have experienced gender-specific forms of police violence, Say Her Name provides some analytical frames for understanding their experiences and broadens dominant conceptions of who experiences state violence and what it looks like. Say Her Name responds to increasing calls for attention to police violence against Black women by offering a resource to help ensure that Black women’s stories are integrated into demands for justice, policy responses to police violence, and media representations of victims and survivors of police brutality.

Stop Telling Women to Smile: Stories of Street Harassment and How We're Taking Back Our Power/Tatyana Fazlalizadeh (Autor)
Every day, all over the world, women are catcalled and denigrated simply for walking down the street. Boys will be boys, women have been told for generations, ignore it, shrug it off, take it as a compliment. But the harassment has real consequences for women: in the fear it instills and the shame they are made to feel.
In Stop Telling Women to Smile, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh uses her arresting street art portraits to explore how women experience hostility in communities that are supposed to be homes. She addresses the pervasiveness of street harassment, its effects, and the kinds of activism that can serve to counter it. The result is a cathartic reckoning with the aggression women endure, and an examination of what equality truly entails. 

Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back/Gretchen Carlson (Autor)
A groundbreaking manifesto from journalist Gretchen Carlson about how women can protect themselves from sexual harassment in the workplace and reclaim their power against abuse or injustice.
In BE FIERCE, Gretchen shares her own experiences, as well as powerful and moving stories from women in many different careers and fields who decided they too weren't ready to shut up and sit down. Gretchen became a voice for the voiceless.
In this revealing and timely book, Gretchen shares her views on what women can do to empower and protect themselves in the workplace or on a college campus, what to say when someone makes suggestive remarks, how an employer's Human Resources department may not always be your friend, and how forced arbitration clauses in work contracts often serve to protect companies rather than employees. Her groundbreaking message encourages women to stand up and speak up in every aspect of their lives.
Gretchen also discusses why this fight will require both women and men working together to ensure that our daughters and sons will have a brighter future.",0,0,Event,26296405,1,comment,2021-03-30 13:12:22+00:00,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],change-org-petitions-to-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-perpetuates-abuse-towards-women-who-speak-up,change-org-petitions-to-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-perpetuates-abuse-towards-women-who-speak-up_limit_1,for
