<p><strong>Watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">the New Movie</a> here:</strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8</a></p>
<p>Among the death threats and social bots online - as tech is a part of this 21st Century story - Waldman refers to homeland security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.' In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a ""007 Flemming's novel"" to an artificial intelligence auditor? </strong></p>
<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. They terrified dozens of actresses.</em> Similarly, intense real-time monitoring occurs for Amber Heard online using AI Bots which claim using ""I am"" Persona Dialogue - open source between 2017 and 2020 - to be 'victims' and use ILM/Alex fill in the blank based on previous text Dialogues which goes beyond a 2021 social network analysis paper using BERT: <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071</a> In irony, Elon Musk's OpenAI GPT-2 and GPT-3 - <a href=""https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot</a> - likely is being used against his ex girlfriend, Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed Depp's agents wanted to make lies about Amber Heard's trips to Tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.</p>
<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is where Amber won in the NGN trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.</p>
<p>Audio clips, which were cut out of timed leaks, from Incredibly Incredible's channel - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a> - are shown to provide context to Coercive Control. From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.</p>
<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore. Right next door to this extreme wealth, are the slums of Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>""What happened on private jets and islands between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp?"" Was it really broadcasted, or was it silenced and twisted?</strong></p>
<p>""Hey @mariannaspring [BBC], after I discovered the connection between Johnny Depp attorney Adam Waldman &amp; a Vladimir Putin-connected Russian oligarch 16 months ago, I postulated the theory Depp's team was using bots to influence public opinion on his case."" - <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/video-reveals-bots-signing-anti-amber-heard-petition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">The Geek Buzz</a>, July 28, 2020</p>
<p>""Twitter can be a hostile place,” [Jennifer Robinson] says. “The online attacks in respect of Amber have been far worse than anything I experienced during the Julian Assange case.” - Financial Times In Context: Jennifer Robinson, Assange's lawyer of 10 years, had to be hired by Amber Heard. Waldman met with Assange to target him at least 7 times. We show a political clip showing texts between Waldman and Senator Warner of Virginia about Steele's dossier.</p>

<li>#AmberHeard​ #Movie​ #JohnnyDepp​ #MeToo​ #ElonMusk​ #Spies​ #Aquaman<br><br><em><strong>We just want to Save Amber Heard's Life</strong></em> and we see that so far, in social network analysis, there were over 600,000 targeted tweets/activities against Amber Heard in 2020. Over 30,000 tweets/activities were on January 27th, days <em>before</em> the audio leaks beginning on January 31st in the Daily Mail newspaper and there were few targeted tweets before then in that month. There were over 50,000 on November 2nd, with heightened targeting when it was announced that she won by Judge Nicol in the UK. Ironically, timed with the USA's elections.</li>
<li>Over 9,000 accounts in Natural Language Understanding are seen against her in latest 50,000 tweets with 1,500 supporting accounts in a more specialized monitoring page process.</li>
<li>Recommended reading is ""The Price of Influence:<br>Disinformation in the Private Sector"" with aged accounts layered then with new accounts: <a href=""https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf</a></li>
<li>Recently, we saw two AI Bot accounts threatening Amber Heard with a dead heart profile and raw flesh banner, and Hunting Hound working, then a faceless profile working to boost as well (layered persona bots). If you recall, the trials in 2020 revealed that Depp put raw meat around the house and in Amber's gown. How does a moderator-type person who is 'not a bystander' sleep? It's like a smoking gun that we used to ask a Twitter Worker - finally reached after all of this time - for help, who said our studies were forwarded.</li>
<li>On April 2nd, they said a proactive bot would be used to monitor for only 1 week. We also tried asking <a href=""https://bodyguard.ai/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Bodyguard AI</a> (from France and gratefully referred by <a href=""https://metta-space.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Metta Space</a> which looks at NLP) about helping, and they can also help protect from targeted customization directly (but that's not an ecosystem). They're just starting to reach the USA.</li>

""<strong>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Heard has reportedly had talks with the studio about doing a Mera TV show, which would end up on HBO Max</strong>. That’s all Richtman, who shared the intel on his <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/DanielRPK/posts"" rel=""nofollow"">Patreon page</a>, has revealed at the moment, but this info does add up with everything we’ve heard about WB’s plans to expand the DCEU onto the small screen and make use of their new streaming service. After all, they’re going to want to create as many offshoots from the movies as they can, so it adds up that they would explore doing more with one of the DC universe’s leading ladies.""</p>
<p>Heard has said she’s excited to return as Mera in Aquaman 2. Not only that, but she might even get her own vehicle as the future queen of the oceans...""</p>
<p><a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/amber-heard-reportedly-talks-hbo-max-spinoff-mera/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/amber-heard-reportedly-talks-hbo-max-spinoff-mera/</a></p>
<p><strong>Remember Amber Heard's extensive evidence despite manipulation via social media online</strong> ... (so much, that we all recently saw the deadly attack at the Washington DC Capitol, which was incited and organized online)....<br>According to someone with NATO clearance, since at least April/March of 2020 it's been known about hostile entities using bots on Twitter and elsewhere to try to cause a USA Civil War... and people continue to walk right into it. The Virginia ruling to dismiss Amber's cyberabuse sections of her counter lawsuit is another sign of USA weaknesses against hate and objectification online that's causing in-person violence. It's tragic.</p>
<p>How does this affect Amber Heard? She's caught in the middle of this era and is a Cyber Civil Rights Spokesperson. SHEILD Act still has not passed.</p>
<p>We're continuing to take down hate pages, such as one on Reddit, and we reported the continuous hate bots, even to an AI Lead of Google (who recognized spam as harmful, but not abuse of saying 'she's not a victim') and a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) worker there.</p>
<p>When will social impact matter more for future generations?</p>
<p><strong>JANUARY 05, 2021 by Eriq Gardner - Amber's Countersuit goes forward, but misses the online part of social manipulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnny Depp Must Face Ex's Libel Suit After His Attorney Declared ""Hoax""</strong></p>
<p>A Virginia judge allows Amber Heard to partially proceed on counterclaims, although not the one that targeted her ex-husband for allegedly deploying bots against her.<br>Johnny Depp has failed to leverage a new law that he may be partially credited for bringing about. On Monday, a Virginia state court judge rejected the actor's bid for immunity over statements made about Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard. As a result, if the case moves to trial later this year, Depp will face counterclaims after his attorney told media outlets that Heard's tale of domestic abuse was a ""hoax.""...</p>
<p>Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was ""fake"" and all part of a ""sexual violence hoax,"" Heard included defamation counterclaims too...</p>
<p>Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims — a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit against a British tabloid. <strong>The November ruling that Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was ""substantially true""</strong> has wounded Depp's career...</p>
<p>The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.</p>
<p>But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the Daily Mail in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.)...</p>
<p>""In support of her accusation of malice, Ms. Heard alleged that the GQ journalist, Mr. Heath, stated that Mr. Depp invited him to interview the actor because he was 'angry —angry about a lot of things —and he's vengeful,'"" states the opinion. ""Moreover, Ms. Heard has alleged that Mr. Depp has the intention of ruining her career; citing statements that he made to friends demonstrating a malicious intent. Further, Mr. Depp has admitted his intent to destroy Ms. Heard's career by stating that he wanted her replaced on Aquaman. Accordingly, Ms. Heard has sufficiently pled a malicious intent, which prevents a ruling on the self-defense privilege at this stage in the litigation.""<br><br>From: <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax</a></p>

About 10–15 minutes later I received a message from Rocky saying something like “he beat the sh** out of her again” and told me she was looking after her. I remember being told that they had reached out to a nurse to do a concussion check. 16. Rocky told me that there was a big fight and Johnny had head butted Amber, ripped out pieces of her hair and smothered her and that they had to call Dr Kipper’s office to get Amber a concussion check. I also talked to Amber about it. 17. I saw Amber that night and the next day saw her injuries: she had bruising around both eyes which extended down the bridge of her nose and her forehead was red…<br>21 May 2016, Los Angeles: I met Jerry downstairs and gave him the phone. He took a few steps to walk away and then turned and asked me ·Is she okay?”. I said something like, “Are you f** kidding me? He beat the sh** out of her again and you guys stood by and watched it”</p>

Just about every conversation alternated between her love for him and the problem of his abuse. These conversations took place well before she divorced Johnny and got a restraining order against him.7.The first time I saw the physical evidence of Johnny’s abuse was before Amber was scheduled to appear on the Late Show with James Corden. Amber and I were supposed to go bowling the night before, but Amber told me that she could not join because she had been in a bad fight with Johnny. I came over to the Eastern Building to apply makeup before her TV appearance, and as I walked into her kitchen, I saw writing on the countertop in gold marker. Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of a picture that depicts the writing I saw that night. I also saw that a number of Amber’s possessions had been smashed or destroyed.”</p>

The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny, with Richard Green serving as the stand-in for Johnny Depp.</p>
<p><strong>Photos, audios, texts, witnesses, and data proved Amber Heard is a victim of domestic abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber is a spokesperson for the ACLU, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, World Identity Network, and United Nations Gender Equality SDG5.</strong></p>
<p>Heard continues to make frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence that were attempting to make their voices heard during that pivotal moment in US history. In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women’s rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically). Amber has continued with trips to Central America where she met with human-rights defenders, diplomats, and indigenous community leaders.</p>
<p><em>She has spoken for, introduced and advocated for democratic candidate Kamala Harris since 2007 and has been very active in supporting Harris in her 2020 presidential run</em>. Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as “revenge porn”) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.</p>
<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.</p>
<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and free-thought in the increasingly polarized political world at Arizona State University for thousands of people attending.</p>

<p><em>Hope</em> is wishing something will happen.</p>
<p><em>Faith</em> is believing something will happen.</p>

<p>So let's have <em>courage</em> , and remember what we are fighting for. </p>

<p><strong>Watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">the New Movie</a> here:</strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8</a></p>
<p>Among the death threats and social bots online - as tech is a part of this 21st Century story - Waldman refers to homeland security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.' In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a ""007 Flemming's novel"" to an artificial intelligence auditor? </strong></p>
<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. They terrified dozens of actresses.</em> Similarly, intense real-time monitoring occurs for Amber Heard online using AI Bots which claim using ""I am"" Persona Dialogue - open source between 2017 and 2020 - to be 'victims' and use ILM/Alex fill in the blank based on previous text Dialogues which goes beyond a 2021 social network analysis paper using BERT: <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071</a> In irony, Elon Musk's OpenAI GPT-2 and GPT-3 - <a href=""https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot</a> - likely is being used against his ex girlfriend, Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed Depp's agents wanted to make lies about Amber Heard's trips to Tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.</p>
<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is where Amber won in the NGN trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.</p>
<p>Audio clips, which were cut out of timed leaks, from Incredibly Incredible's channel - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a> - are shown to provide context to Coercive Control. From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.</p>
<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore. Right next door to this extreme wealth, are the slums of Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>""What happened on private jets and islands between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp?"" Was it really broadcasted, or was it silenced and twisted?</strong></p>
<p>""Hey @mariannaspring [BBC], after I discovered the connection between Johnny Depp attorney Adam Waldman &amp; a Vladimir Putin-connected Russian oligarch 16 months ago, I postulated the theory Depp's team was using bots to influence public opinion on his case."" - <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/video-reveals-bots-signing-anti-amber-heard-petition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">The Geek Buzz</a>, July 28, 2020</p>
<p>""Twitter can be a hostile place,” [Jennifer Robinson] says. “The online attacks in respect of Amber have been far worse than anything I experienced during the Julian Assange case.” - Financial Times In Context: Jennifer Robinson, Assange's lawyer of 10 years, had to be hired by Amber Heard. Waldman met with Assange to target him at least 7 times. We show a political clip showing texts between Waldman and Senator Warner of Virginia about Steele's dossier.</p>
<p>""... It's a hoax by Adam ""former lobbyist for Russian Putin Lackey Oleg Deripaska who sought complete immunity in the US Senate Russian 2016 hacking hearings"" Waldman."" - <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/in-memoriam-judge-tires-of-comrade-waldman-gives-him-the-boot/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">The Geek Buzz</a>, July 29, 2020 (Bots &amp; Personality?)</p>
<p>""New legal claims filed against Johnny Depp for targeting his ex-wife on social media, specifically through the alleged deployment of ""bots"" to smear her and interfere with her career opportunities."" - Eric Gardner, Hollywood Reporter ""RottenTomatoes, IMDB, metacritic have all all changed their online methods to post reviews because of it. Again, very similar patterns and, frankly, targets. In 2016, the target was Hillary Clinton.

<li>#AmberHeard​ #Movie​ #JohnnyDepp​ #MeToo​ #ElonMusk​ #Spies​ #Aquaman<br><br><em><strong>We just want to Save Amber Heard's Life</strong></em> and we see that so far, in social network analysis, there were over 600,000 targeted tweets/activities against Amber Heard in 2020. Over 30,000 tweets/activities were on January 27th, days <em>before</em> the audio leaks beginning on January 31st in the Daily Mail newspaper and there were few targeted tweets before then in that month. There were over 50,000 on November 2nd, with heightened targeting when it was announced that she won by Judge Nicol in the UK. Ironically, timed with the USA's elections.</li>

<li>Recently, we saw two AI Bot accounts threatening Amber Heard with a dead heart profile and raw flesh banner, and Hunting Hound working, then a faceless profile working to boost as well (layered persona bots). If you recall, the trials in 2020 revealed that Depp put raw meat around the house and in Amber's gown. How does a moderator-type person who is 'not a bystander' sleep? It's like a smoking gun that we used to ask a Twitter Worker - finally reached after all of this time - for help, who said our studies were forwarded.</li>
<li>On April 2nd, they said a proactive bot would be used to monitor for only 1 week.

That’s all Richtman, who shared the intel on his <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/DanielRPK/posts"" rel=""nofollow"">Patreon page</a>, has revealed at the moment, but this info does add up with everything we’ve heard about WB’s plans to expand the DCEU onto the small screen and make use of their new streaming service. After all, they’re going to want to create as many offshoots from the movies as they can, so it adds up that they would explore doing more with one of the DC universe’s leading ladies.""</p>
<p>Heard has said she’s excited to return as Mera in Aquaman 2. Not only that, but she might even get her own vehicle as the future queen of the oceans...""</p>

<p><strong>Remember Amber Heard's extensive evidence despite manipulation via social media online</strong> ... (so much, that we all recently saw the deadly attack at the Washington DC Capitol, which was incited and organized online)....<br>According to someone with NATO clearance, since at least April/March of 2020 it's been known about hostile entities using bots on Twitter and elsewhere to try to cause a USA Civil War... and people continue to walk right into it. The Virginia ruling to dismiss Amber's cyberabuse sections of her counter lawsuit is another sign of USA weaknesses against hate and objectification online that's causing in-person violence. It's tragic.</p>
<p>How does this affect Amber Heard? She's caught in the middle of this era and is a Cyber Civil Rights Spokesperson. SHEILD Act still has not passed.</p>
<p>We're continuing to take down hate pages, such as one on Reddit, and we reported the continuous hate bots, even to an AI Lead of Google (who recognized spam as harmful, but not abuse of saying 'she's not a victim') and a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) worker there.</p>
<p>When will social impact matter more for future generations?</p>
<p><strong>JANUARY 05, 2021 by Eriq Gardner - Amber's Countersuit goes forward, but misses the online part of social manipulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnny Depp Must Face Ex's Libel Suit After His Attorney Declared ""Hoax""</strong></p>
<p>A Virginia judge allows Amber Heard to partially proceed on counterclaims, although not the one that targeted her ex-husband for allegedly deploying bots against her.<br>Johnny Depp has failed to leverage a new law that he may be partially credited for bringing about. On Monday, a Virginia state court judge rejected the actor's bid for immunity over statements made about Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard. As a result, if the case moves to trial later this year, Depp will face counterclaims after his attorney told media outlets that Heard's tale of domestic abuse was a ""hoax.""...</p>
<p>Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was ""fake"" and all part of a ""sexual violence hoax,"" Heard included defamation counterclaims too...</p>
<p>Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims — a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit against a British tabloid. <strong>The November ruling that Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was ""substantially true""</strong> has wounded Depp's career...</p>
<p>The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.</p>
<p>But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the Daily Mail in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.)...</p>
<p>""In support of her accusation of malice, Ms. Heard alleged that the GQ journalist, Mr. Heath, stated that Mr. Depp invited him to interview the actor because he was 'angry —angry about a lot of things —and he's vengeful,'"" states the opinion. ""Moreover, Ms. Heard has alleged that Mr. Depp has the intention of ruining her career; citing statements that he made to friends demonstrating a malicious intent. Further, Mr. Depp has admitted his intent to destroy Ms. Heard's career by stating that he wanted her replaced on Aquaman. Accordingly, Ms. Heard has sufficiently pled a malicious intent, which prevents a ruling on the self-defense privilege at this stage in the litigation.""<br><br>From: <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax</a></p>

About 10–15 minutes later I received a message from Rocky saying something like “he beat the sh** out of her again” and told me she was looking after her. I remember being told that they had reached out to a nurse to do a concussion check. 16. Rocky told me that there was a big fight and Johnny had head butted Amber, ripped out pieces of her hair and smothered her and that they had to call Dr Kipper’s office to get Amber a concussion check. I also talked to Amber about it. 17. I saw Amber that night and the next day saw her injuries: she had bruising around both eyes which extended down the bridge of her nose and her forehead was red…<br>21 May 2016, Los Angeles: I met Jerry downstairs and gave him the phone. He took a few steps to walk away and then turned and asked me ·Is she okay?”. I said something like, “Are you f** kidding me?

Just about every conversation alternated between her love for him and the problem of his abuse. These conversations took place well before she divorced Johnny and got a restraining order against him.7.The first time I saw the physical evidence of Johnny’s abuse was before Amber was scheduled to appear on the Late Show with James Corden. Amber and I were supposed to go bowling the night before, but Amber told me that she could not join because she had been in a bad fight with Johnny. I came over to the Eastern Building to apply makeup before her TV appearance, and as I walked into her kitchen, I saw writing on the countertop in gold marker. Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of a picture that depicts the writing I saw that night. I also saw that a number of Amber’s possessions had been smashed or destroyed.”</p>

<p><strong>Photos, audios, texts, witnesses, and data proved Amber Heard is a victim of domestic abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber is a spokesperson for the ACLU, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, World Identity Network, and United Nations Gender Equality SDG5.</strong></p>
<p>Heard continues to make frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence that were attempting to make their voices heard during that pivotal moment in US history. In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women’s rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically). Amber has continued with trips to Central America where she met with human-rights defenders, diplomats, and indigenous community leaders.</p>
<p><em>She has spoken for, introduced and advocated for democratic candidate Kamala Harris since 2007 and has been very active in supporting Harris in her 2020 presidential run</em>. Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as “revenge porn”) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.</p>
<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.</p>
<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and free-thought in the increasingly polarized political world at Arizona State University for thousands of people attending.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28892582,2021-04-16 19:57:16+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Bodycam Footage Drops,"<p>In a shocking turn of events, bodycam footage has dropped from the night Aber Heard claims that Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and trashed the condo.</p>
<p>On the night of the blowout fight, a friend of Heard, who asked to remain anonymous had dialed 911, claiming that the actress was being ‘assaulted’ by her boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Hi, I need to report an assault right now happening at 849 Broadway at the Eastern building, it’s penthouse three,” the female caller says in the recording, referring to the luxurious home the former couple previously shared in downtown LA.</p>
<p>“I happen to know that it’s happening and I just need to remain anonymous,” she added.</p>
<p>“So what did she say that this guy assaulted her or hit her?” the LAPD operator replies, explaining she needs more detail.</p>
<p>“Physically assaulting her, yeah,” replies the caller ”Send somebody up there please,” the caller pleads, reiterating the location of the couple’s penthouse before the call abruptly ends.</p>
<p>Another 911 call was made by Heard’s friend iO Tillet Wright.</p>
<p>That means that two sets of officers responded to the scene. And both sets of officers have insisted from day one that they saw no evidence of violence, not on Heard’s face, and not in the condo.</p>
<p>Up until now, it’s been a matter of he say/she say, leaving judges, journalists, and the public to decide who to believe.</p>
<p>But now, the debate is over. In bodycam footage from the second set of officers, the condo is clearly seen as being tidy and undamaged. You can read the article from the Daily Mail <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9474979/Johnny-Depp-says-police-bodycam-footage-PROVES-Amber-Heard-lying.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And you can see a clear version of the bodycam footage <a href=""https://twitter.com/DigitalDDaniels/status/1383126221458915332"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Depp’s attorney Adam Wadman says the footage proves that there was never any wrecking spree and that Heard’s account of the evening cannot be believed.</p>
<p>“Amber Heard and her friends described a chaotic, messy crime scene but the newly released LAPD bodycam videos unambiguously show that the penthouse was utterly undamaged and that their testimony was one more grandiose lie,” Waldman told DailyMail.com in a statement.</p>
<p>Depp and Heard will square off in April, 2022 in a defamation suit that Depp filed against his ex-wife. It remains to be seen how this new footage will affect the proceedings, but it doesn’t look good for Heard.</p>
<p>It also remains to be seen if this new evidence will inspire perjury charges in previously offered court testimony in Depp’s recent libel suit against NGN and the Sun tabloid in the UK. That’s where Heard described the chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Heard is currently being investigated for perjury charges in Australia for testimony surrounding an incident in which Heard smuggled the couple’s dogs into Australia in violation of quarantine laws.</p>
<p>It’s possible that these mounting legal woes will affect Heard’s appearance in any upcoming projects, and could potentially land her jail time. Time will tell the extent to which this new evidence, and Depp’s impending slander suit will affect Amber Heard.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard shrug this evidence off? Or is this the mic drop moment for Depp in his quest to vindicate himself?</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28836434,2021-04-07 15:16:28+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Aquaman 2 filming and release dates,"<p>Aquaman 2 is expected to start production this coming June (2021) in the UK under the working title ‘Necrus.’ In Aquaman lore, Necrus is another underwater city like Atlantis, ruled by the militaristic King Mongo. Unlike Atlantis, its placement is unstable, meaning the location of the city constantly changes, never to be found in the same place twice. Apparently. So, while the working title could just be a fun nod to lore, it could also mean Arthur may interact, or even fight, Mongo. It’s safe to say that Black Manta will return as Aquaman’s nemesis.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa will return as the titular character, and despite fans’ protestations, Amber Heard is still clutching the notion that she will once again be the queen of the deep. However, there’s also been constant speculation that a new major female character is being written into the script, as a means to both increase diversity among the ensemble and reduce Heard’s screen time in the event of a worst case scenario. WB has yet to confirm that, but insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that Aquaman 2 will have four female leads, though the tipster doesn’t offer any further details to elaborate on his intel.</p>
<p>Heard’s Mera, the aforementioned mystery character and Nicole Kidman’s returning Queen Atlanna will presumably make up 75% of the quartet, leaving one position unfilled. But with filming set to start a mere two months away, we should start to get some answers soon, both about the new mystery character and Heard’s dubious chances of returning as the film’s primary female lead.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2 is currently set for a December 16, 2022 release.</p>

It’s an interesting reaction, considering she already won the UK lawsuit, but apparently Amber Heard has simply had enough of the Internet backlash.</p>
<p>Adam Waldman called Amber out in a tweet pointing out that despite claims of being brutalized by Johnny Depp, Amber Heard appears days later in a photo shoot, without any sign of injury. </p>
<p>Heard's backlash was to call Waldman short. Such witty repartee. </p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that Adam Waldman is actually Johnny Depp’s lawyer, and that he’s been using social media as a way to call Amber Heard and her claims into question. This includes much of the majority of his Twitter feed, but it was the particular image posted above that caught Amber Heard’s attention. It seemed she had enough of Adam Waldman, and decided to respond to him and a variety of Johnny Depp fans on Twitter as a result.</p>
<p>Most recently, Depp supporters have been targeted, having their comments reported en masse in an attempt to have them banned from Twitter. The Depp supporters remain, however, and don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. </p>
<p>I wrote a <a href=""https://lepplady.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/amber-turd-on-twitter-rampage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">blog article</a> about Heard's Twitter rampage, having been targeted myself.

<p>Depp and Heard have to wait a full year before Depp's Defamation case against Heard gets to court. In that time, I'm sure we'll see a lot of action back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband. And, from the look of it, we can expect to see even more hostilities between Heard, her posse on Twitter, and Johnny Depp supporters.</p>

<p>Rubbish. I'd like to use a stronger word, but refrain.</p>
<p>As much as this is a blow to Johnny Depp, it's more of a defeat for male victims of domestic violence, particularly in the UK. This kind of finding tells them that, no. they won't be believed, so just shut up and take it, and don't you dare speak up. It shouldn't be that way. I must change.</p>
<p>The thing to remember at this point is that this verdict is not a win for Amber Heard. This case wasn't against her. It was against NGN and the Sun.</p>
<p>What we can do now is look forward to the Defamation trial in VA. That one is directly between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. I'm a little nervous about that one because Heard never named Depp in her WaPo OpEd, the reason he finally sued her. On that basis alone, it could very well go her way, even though it's obvious who she was talking about. </p>
<p>But no matter how it goes, the truth about Heard will come out. There's evidence we haven't even seen yet. No matter how court goes, she loses in the court of public opinion, which will directly impact upon her career. Let's remember that she doesn't have any active projects coming up while Johnny Depp and his production company is directly involved with no fewer than 20 projects coming up. </p>
<p>This decision today is beyond ridiculous but it's one battle, not the war. Let's try to stay positive and look forward to the Virginia trial. It's a different court, a different case, and is more than likely to come out a different way. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28633362,2021-03-01 18:23:47+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard facing jail time?,"<p>According to <a href=""https://www.distractify.com/p/is-amber-heard-going-to-jail"" rel=""nofollow"">Distractify</a>, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail time if the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor.</p>
<p>Amber Heard could be going to jail if Johnny Depp wins his lawsuit.<br>Basically, Amber Heard claimed on the stand in Johnny’s libel suit against the Sun tabloid that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused her.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, Heard showed up in court with a black eye seeking a restraining order. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this. She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.”</p>
<p>Since then, Johnny Depp has fought back against every bad word against him with libel and defamation lawsuits, so far against The Sun (which he lost), and against Amber Heard, which has not yet been seen in court. According to Deadline, the latest update is that their court date is once again pushed back to at least April 11, 2022. If Amber Heard loses, she could face jail time for tampering with evidence.</p>
<p>Even though it’s possible Johnny Depp could win his upcoming lawsuit in the coming years, there’s no confirming whether or not Amber Heard will face jail time. Regardless, this puts Warner Bros. in a tough spot. Even though fans had petitioned for Warner Bros. to force Amber Heard’s resignation from Aquaman 2, WB hasn’t announced any plans for change.</p>
<p>However, in December 2020, a lifestyle article in Forbes about Emilia Clarke’s home let the cat out of the bag that Emilia Clarke had signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in Aquaman 2. Sadly, though, there’s still no confirmation. It could just be wishful thinking on the fans’ part.</p>
<p>It’s not clear according to that article why Amber Heard could be facing jail time if Johnny Depp wins his appeal. They mention tampering with evidence, but don’t say clearly what evidence, or how it was tampered with.</p>
<p>I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that if Johnny wins his appeal, Heard might be on the hook for some very serious perjury charges. She’s already being investigated in Australia for Perjury charges for falsifying statements about smuggling their dogs Pistol and Boo into the country. So it wouldn’t be a far stretch if she’s investigated in a London court for the same crime. Not for lying about the dogs, this time, though, but for potentially lying on the stand during Johnny’s libel case against NGN and the Sun tabloid.</p>
<p>It could be for something else altogether.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that there’s no statute of limitations in Australia for grievous bodily injury requiring medical attention. And that’s where Heard cut off the tip of Johnny’s finger with a Vodka bottle. And, no. I’m not making a wild accusation there. Heard herself was recorded on audiotape admitting that she did, saying “I didn’t mean to do it!” and begging Johnny not to leave her.</p>
<p>The point being, if Johnny wanted to, he could always file a report with Australian police and have her put behind bars for a long time. And if her were the vengeful monster she keeps trying to say he is, he would have done that already.</p>
<p>All Johnny’s interested in is clearing his name. He’s said it time and time again, and the fact that Heard’s not cooling her heels already in an Australian prison proves it.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard face jail time if Johnny wins his appeal? Or if he wins his defamation suit? Should Johnny press charges in Australia over his severed finger?</p>
<p>Yeah. I do too.</p>","{'id': '225270885', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/yp/om/ahyPoMgOnXIvGwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614623031', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28619185,2021-02-26 19:57:00+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard Physically unfit?,"<p>It’s looking more and more like Amber Heard really won’t be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>This petition has reported long since that Heard’s contract has been bought out by WB and that she won’t appear in Aquaman 2. But the masses want proof, rightfully so. Well, the more time goes by, the more it looks like we might actually have been properly informed.</p>
<p>It’s being reported lately that Emilia Clarke might have signed on to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. But, again, there’s no confirmation, though an article in Forbes seems to be as legit a source as it gets. So we can’t be sure about that part of the speculation about Amber Heard’s dubious future in AM2.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>Recently, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf2AgE2eE8M"" rel=""nofollow"">Popcorned Planet</a>’s Andy Signore went on record saying: “The part of this story that is true is that, yes, Amber Heard is fired from Aquaman 2. Now, from what I’ve heard so far she’s been fired from Aquaman 2. From what I’ve heard through a source, though other people that are involved in the production is that it already happened.”</p>
<p>Previously, we’ve heard that WB bought out Heard’s contract because she might not be bondable (due to alcohol and drug use, perhaps?). If she can’t be insured for the duration of filming, she can’t film.</p>
<p>But the reason might be something completely different than what we thought.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/movies/amber-heard-aquaman-2-contract-terminated-for-health-fitness-reasons/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sausage Roll</a>, Amber Heard might not appear in AM2 because she ‘s not physically fit enough. They say: “Amber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She’s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.”</p>
<p>True to form, Heard manages to blame Johnny Depp for it, throwing Covid in for good measure. “Heard allegedly blamed Johnny Depp and COVID-19 for her deteriorating health, saying that she’s been under tremendous amount of stress and has been suffering from depression but she insists that she will get back in shape.”</p>
<p>Filming for Aquaman 2 is set to start filming in June (2021), so it remains to be seen whether or not she’ll get back in shape. We’ll also have to wait and see if she is, or becomes, bondable for filming.</p>
<p>That seems like a lot to happen in just a few months.</p>
<p>Also, according to another industry insider, Heard may have failed to report an injury. If she were injured, failed to report it and got further injured during training, which is quite rigorous, the studio would have been on the hook for it. So, it's entirely possible that this is the nature of Heard being physically unfit.</p>
<p>Whichever the reason it seems more likely than not that the rumors about Amber Heard not appearing in AM2 are true. I don’t know whether it will Emelia Clarke or not that takes over, but I’m totally on board with it if it is.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard fit back into the fish suit again or will we see somebody else taking over screen time in AM2?</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28613653,2021-02-25 21:01:42+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Johnny Depp pissed off?,"<p>The latest story coming from leaker Daniel Richtman is saying that <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/johnny-depp-reportedly-furious-amber-heard-job-offers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Johnny Depp is furious</a> that his ex-wife Amber Heard’s star appears to be rising as his falls. According to Richtman Depp is “pissed” that she keeps getting work.</p>
<p>Heard recently appeared in CBS’ The Stand and is about to film Aquaman 2 despite multiple <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/petition-amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-closing-2m-signatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">fan campaigns</a> trying to get her fired (Mera will also play a minor role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League next month, a movie that’s already been filmed).</p>
<p>But it’s the latest rumor doing the rounds that must seriously enrage Depp, as reports say that Heard is in contention to portray <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-reportedly-play-liveaction-rapunzel-disney/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rapunzel</a> in Disney’s live-action version of Tangled.</p>
<p>The actress potentially being hired by the House of Mouse for a big role just as they drop Depp from his most iconic part (Captain Jack Sparrow, of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) must really stick in his craw.</p>
<p>But this story isn’t over yet, as Depp is mounting an appeal to the verdict in his failed libel suit against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, and there are lawsuits filed in Virginia that could go more favorably for him.</p>
<p>Still, According to Richtman, right now, Heard is going from strength-to-strength and Johnny Depp is suffering major career damage. So even if he’s eventually vindicated, he might never again be the A-lister he once was.</p>
<p>Where to start.</p>
<p>First, the sober truth is that Heard is a little long in the tooth to portray a Disney princess. Those girls are usually in their mid-teens, and Heard is twice that age now. It’s highly unlikely that she’s up for any such part.</p>
<p>Second, after Heard has pestered Disney with subpoenas and legal shenanigans, it’s not likely at all that they would line up to sign her for anything, let alone a role half her age.</p>
<p>Third, Johnny is not hurting for work. If you look at Depp’s <a href=""https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000136?rf=cons_nm_meter&amp;ref_=cons_nm_meter"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB pro</a> page, he’s lined up to be involved with more than twenty projects.</p>
<p>Heard has <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" rel=""nofollow"">2 projects</a> on her books. Aquaman 2, which she probably won’t appear in. Strong rumor has it that Emilia Clark will replace Heard in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>The other project is “Run away with me” a project which was abandoned years ago. Two movies she will most likely not even appear in. That’s it. That’s all she’s got scheduled for future projects.</p>
<p>Finally, but not least, it’s looking more and more like Johnny Depp is going to be vindicated in both court proceedings, leaving him in a much more favorable position than Heard.</p>
<p>So it’s not quite as bleak for Depp as Richtman would have you believe. Either his information is faulty or he’s just plain wrong.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard’s star rising? Or is Depp coming out on top?</p>","{'id': '225257223', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/pj/sq/bdpJsQhkPxDtqNI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614286904', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28602060,2021-02-24 00:26:36+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Trial date pushed back,"<p>The defamation suit Johnny Depp took out against his ex wife Amber Heard was scheduled to on May 7th, 2021. But, probably due to Covid, the trial date has been pushed back to April 11th, 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that Johnny will get word back about his appeal to overturn the verdict in his libel suit against NGN and The Sun tabloid before he even sets foot in the courtroom for his defamation suit against Heard. He might be vindicated on the British front first.</p>
<p>Heard has been worried in the past about how the defamation suit will affect her filming schedule. But if she's found to have lied in a British court, and if Australia has their way about her lying in one of their courts, her filming schedule might be the last thing she'll have to worry about. </p>
<p>Instead, the courts might have to figure out how to het her from jail to the courtroom. That could make for some interesting travel plans.</p>
<p>Somehow, I doubt that the flight they'd put her on would have Champaign and caviar.  </p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard go to jail for lying to a British High Court? Or will she get out of it somehow?</p>

<p><a href=""https://insidethemagic.net/2021/02/amber-heard-tangled-ad1/"" rel=""nofollow"">One article</a> says that she's negotiating to play princess Rapunzel in Tangled. <a href=""https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/amber-heard-disney-princess.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Another one</a> backs it up.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how seriously to take these revelations. </p>
<p>First, there's the messy legal battle that's warring between Amber Heard and her ex-husband Johnny Depp. It's a sordid affair, and Heard has dragged Disney into it by demanding a plethora of documents from them, pretty much any dealing they ever had with Johnny Depp, his schedule, his contracts, his alleged drug use or bad behavior on the set, anything she can get her hands on.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that Disney would be too quick to negotiate with somebody who's causing them so many legal woes.</p>
<p>And second, there's the demographic of Disney princesses. Traditionally, Disney princesses are in their mid-teens, just coming into their own. Amber Heard is 34 years old, and not getting any younger. That's just about twice the age of the average Disney princess. </p>
<p>I suppose it's not impossible that Heard could be in talks with Disney to portray a princess, but I think it's highly unlikely.</p>
<p>A lot of frivolous press has been floating around about Heard lately, but I personally think that this is among the more amusing. </p>
<p>What do you think? Would Amber Heard personify a Disney princess? Or has the time for kind of role come and long gone for her?</p>","{'id': '225220517', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/lw/xn/KIlwxNJYTqhbTMN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613504731', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
StarterPetitionUpdate,28555166,2021-02-15 20:49:24+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard wants Aquaman 3,"<p>Often when putting together a franchise, the powers that be offer the principal players a three picture deal. That cuts down on scheduling conflicts and keeps actors from negotiating for a better deal in-between each picture. But that’s not always the case. Just as often, they take it one film at a time.</p>
<p>In the case of the Aquaman franchise, it looks like they opted to do one film at a time. If that is indeed the case, no actor is guaranteed a part in the second or third installment.</p>
<p>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Amber Heard is already scrambling to try to secure her place in Aquaman 3, even though AM2 hasn’t even begun to film yet.</p>
<p>There are doubts about whether or not Heard will even appear in AM2. Almost 2 million people have made it clear that they don’t want to see Amber Heard in any further AM films, and it’s possible that WB is paying attention. One rumor has it that Heard’s screen time in AM2 is being severely curtailed, with another female lead taking on more screen time.</p>
<p>Other rumors whisper that Heard’s contract has been bought out, meaning that while Heard got paid, she will not appear in the film at all.</p>
<p>There are several factors that will likely determine whether Heard comes back in any subsequent Aquaman films. First, there are the court cases going back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. Depp is suing Heard for Defamation for portraying him as a domestic abuser who physically abused and terrorized her throughout their marriage. Depp is having none of that is on a legal crusade to clear his good name and prove that it was Heard who was the abuser the entire time. Heard has a lot of sob storied and the support of her friends to back up her abuse storied, while Depp has video and audio recordings of her admitting to abusing him. Unlike Heard, Depp also has medical evidence, including a fingertip that got severed and a burn on his cheek from a cigarette being put out on his face.</p>
<p>The two are also embroiled in litigation in England from a libel case that Depp leveled against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, for calling Depp a wife-beater. Initially, the judgement favored the Sun, who repeated that wife-beater claim again. But Depp is appealing the verdict, and will likely prevail.</p>
<p>If these two cases go Depp’s way, it doesn’t bode well for Heard’s continued presence in the AM franchise. Most films have a morals clause in their contracts, and if Heard is proven to be a domestic abuser again, that clause might very well be invoked.</p>
<p>I say “again” because Heard was arrested in 2009 for domestic abuse against her then wife Tasya Van Ree.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of whether or not Heard is bondable. That is to say, whether or not she can be insured for the duration of filming. If she can’t be insured for any reason, like a preexisting medical condition, excessive drug or alcohol abuse, she can’t and won’t be hired for any future AM project.</p>
<p>Heard supporters insist that she’ll be in AM2 and 3 because there hasn’t been any official announcement from WB about her being dropped. But that’s not the way it works. If Heard has been dropped, there likely won’t be any announcement. The movie will simply come out without her in it. So fans who want her dropped who are waiting for an announcement won’t get one. We’ll just have to wait for the film to come out to see whether she’s in it or not.</p>
<p>Time will have to tell whether or not Amber Heard is in Aquaman 2, let alone Aquaman 3. We’ll have to wait and see how those court cases come out, and whether or not Heard is bondable. As ever, I’ll bring you the latest as I find it.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28550493,2021-02-14 20:58:00+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Amber Heard is a nobody,"<p>Amber Heard is a nobody, at least according to Amber Heard. In one of her latest court filings, Amber has a fit about people calling her that.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard filed in her original $100 million dollar counterclaim to Johnny Depp’s $50 million dollar defamation suit against her, that there was an army of bots under Depp’s command torturing her. Even creating and/or signing this very petition. An investigation found less than a dozen questionable Twitter accounts that might be bots, blowing that claim out of the water.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Heard has shoved forward, trying to obtain personal data about 200 Twitter users, to prove that they’re bots and not real people, I guess.</p>
<p>Now, she’s down to two. TWO people that she’s upset at for: 1) saying they’re proud of Johnny Depp for fighting to clear his name, and 2) refer to the defendant (Heard), a movie star, as “a nobody.” And she had to put that in there, that she’s “a movie star.” She needed to point that out, I suppose, in case anybody forgets that she got lucky off the back of being married to Johnny Depp and scored Aquaman. Would she have gotten that movie on her own? Anybody? Bueller?</p>
<p>She’s throwing everything she can at the wall with regards to Twitter users, hoping that something will stick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of the statements she’s throwing around by Twitter fans are protected opinions of celebrities. People just don’t like her, and there’s not one single thing she can do about it.</p>
<p>What I suspect, however, is that she doesn’t really expect any of this Twitter bluster to stick to the wall. I think it’s a diversionary tactic, intended to direct attention away from the avalanche of evidence Johnny Depp has that’s bearing down on her.</p>
<p>And it works. For a minute. But she’s deluding only herself if she thinks that the people who support Johnny Depp are about to lose sight of the big picture. They might point fingers and laugh at her folly when she tries some new antic, but they’re steadfast to the case at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>What will she pull next? What new filing will she throw at the court to try to filibuster her way out of the inevitable? We’ll have to wait and see. One thing that’s sure is that it’ll bring out more finger pointing and giggles, at least until the final verdicts come down. Then it will be Johnny Depp that gets the last laugh.</p>

You know, the one where Heard claimed that Depp struck her in the face with a phone.</p>
<p>iO has been very vocal in his support of Heard, claiming to bear witness to the after-effects of many violent episodes where Heard said that Depp brutalized her. Blood on a pillow, hair on the floor, that sort of thing. Mind you, iO never witnessed any violence, just saw that (staged?) scene afterwards.</p>
<p>Now, iO is trying to quash the subpoena calling for him to appear for a deposition.</p>
<p>In his motion to quash, iO says: “I am not a party to the above-referenced actions. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would completely do so.”</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“I have never been served with any subpoena in this action (Case No. 19stcp04763) or in the Virginia Fairfax County Court Action (Case no. CL-2019-0002911). Rather, I understand that Mr. Depp’s lawyers emailed copies of the subpoena to my lawyer, Lee Brenner, on January 20, 2021.”</p>
<p>“I do not reside at the address of 6144 Panorama Street, Joshua Tree, CA 92252, and I have never resided at that address. I have no ownership interest in that address.”</p>
<p>I understand that a man named Anthony was at the address that day, and I have spoken to him. He said that he spoke to a process server that day (Jan 19, 2021) who left a pile of papers on the front step.”</p>
<p>“I declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.”</p>
<p>“Executed this 8th day of February 2021, and Joshua Tree, California.”</p>
<p>And he signed it.</p>
<p>Further: “Here, Mr. Wright was not served with the subpoena at issue. See Wright Cecl. At ¶ 3-5. First, he does not reside at the address listed on the Subpoena nor does he have any ownership interest in that address. Id., at ¶3, Mr. Wright has spoken with a man named Anthony who was at the address listed on the “proof of service” on January 19 2021 and was told that a process server left a pile of papers on the front step. Id., at ¶5. Mr. Wright does not know why anyone would say that they served him because they simply did not. Id., at ¶ 4. In the light of the foregoing, the subpoenas are procedurally defective and should be quashed.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>First, if iO has no ownership or interest in that address, how does he know who was there on that day or any other? He clearly knows more than he's letting on, to have spoken with a man he says was there that day.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t care one way or another where iO lives, but this just doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>What’s iO so scared of that he’s trying to dodge his subpoena? Is he afraid that the hoax is finally going to catch up with him and that he could face charges of perjury if he lies to an American court? Fines can be hefty, and jail isn’t exactly kind to trans persons.</p>
<p>Maybe the time has come for iO to reconsider his position in the Amber Heard fiasco. Because, dodge as he might, that subpoena is going to catch up to him, like it or not.</p>

<p>That's the problem with the mainstream media, especially lately. They take a scrap of a story and run with it, or make one up all together, with no real basis in fact.

<p>If these articles show anything, it's not the demise of Johnny Depp's career. It's that you can't believe everything you read, especially when it comes to Johnny Depp and his ex. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28508017,2021-02-07 17:17:38+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Russian Bots sign the Petition,"<p>In an interesting turn of events, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">new video</a> has surfaced of somebody using Russian bots to sign the petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">the video</a>, a nameless, faceless person uses a Russian website to create over 2,000 signatures.</p>
<p>According to the video’s creator, for over 16 hours his bot signed the petition over 2,000 times. It can do 3,000 a day from ONE bot channel and infinitely more from multiple channels.</p>
<p>The fact that the bots in this case are being made to look Russian in origin plays right into Amber Heard's narrative that all or most of the signatures on the petition are fake. And it's important that they're of Russian origin, since great measures were taken to try to tie them to Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp's lawyer and friend.</p>
<p>According to this article: ""The bot’s Russian origin is a crucial aspect of this story. Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp’s attorney who was barred from his upcoming libel case in the United States, is a former lobbyist for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire, and Kremlin insider. It’s believed by some he was involved with or has insider knowledge, of the 2016 hacking of the US election.""</p>
<p>Laying it on really thick in the anti-Waldman crusade.</p>
<p>In recent history, two things have apparently bothered Amber Heard: Adam Waldman and this petition. She took care of Waldman by successfully lobbying to get him removed from Johnny Depp's upcoming Fairfax defamation case against Amber Heard. That backfired, though, since removing Waldman from the case left him free to discuss the case freely. And he has been. Check out <a href=""https://twitter.com/adam_waldman"" rel=""nofollow"">Waldman's Twitter</a> feed to read some delightful insights into the case.</p>
<p>And it's obvious that the petition bothers Heard, who mentions it prominently in her $100 million dollar countersuit.</p>
<p>It's not the first time action has been taken to try and get the petition removed. Not long ago, negative comments were posted on the petition, and then reported as violations to try to get the petition taken down.</p>
<p>That didn't work, and this isn't going to, either. I've already been in contact with Change.org, and rest assured. The petition is quite safe.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp has a hearing on 18 March regarding his appeal in the UK libel case against the Sun, and the defamation suit in Fairfax is due to start in May - if it's not pushed back due to Covid.</p>
<p>With these cases looming so large, it's possible that more shenanigans will pop up trying to further discredit Adam Waldman and attack the petition. Hopefully, both of these cases will reach fruition soon, and the matter can be decided, once and for all. </p>
<p>How do you think these cases will play out? Will Johnny Depp get justice? Or will Amber Heard prevail?</p>

For instance, Aquaman 2 could recast the entire ensemble from top to bottom and people would still be willing to check it out, as long as Jason Momoa remained on board as Arthur Curry.</p>
<p>Of course, there’ve been a lot of fans threatening to boycott the DCEU sequel entirely based on Amber Heard’s continued involvement in the underwater adventures, although she doesn’t care in the slightest and can’t wait to suit up as Mera again. However, there are reports making the rounds that a new female lead is being introduced as well, one that could potentially reduce Heard’s screen time in the finished product depending on how her next court case opposite ex-husband Johnny Depp plays out.</p>
<p>On that note, insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that the actress is furious after catching wind of the decision, and isn’t happy with Warner Bros. trying to essentially force her out of the spotlight as the female lead of the highest-grossing DC Comics adaptation in history. </p>
<p>We might take this report with a grain of salt, though, considering insiders in the industry have been saying for months that Heard won't be in Aquaman 2 at all. </p>
<p>Sources say that WB has bought out Heard's contract completely. That means that she'll be compensated for her contract without actually appearing in the film. </p>
<p>This flies in the face of some media claims that she's going to get a raise or that <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-join-team-zack-snyders-justice-league/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mera will take over</a> for the titular Arthur Curry in the Justice League movies. I guess we'll just have to wait and see who's right.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp and his legal team immediately appealed the decision.</p>
<p>The appeals process has been rather involved, first going to the original judge to approve or deny that the appeal should move forward, which the judge denied. It was his judgement, after all. That was to be expected.</p>
<p>That left team Depp open to take the appeal to the next level, further requesting that the judge's denial should be overlooked and that the appeal should move forward.</p>
<p>That process could have left Depp and his crew in legal limbo for a year or more. But now, Depp's lawyers have asked for permission to introduce new evidence. That's ramped up the process, and there's going to be a hearing on the evidence, and the appeal at large.</p>
<p>The hearing is set for March 18th. </p>

She’s tying herself to Wood, including them together in her claims railing against men she seems to allege are getting away with abusing women, calling out the media, saying: “...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan &amp; I aren’t the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?”</p>
<p>It seems that Heard went on a bender last night, posting about how the media seems to be ignoring Marilyn Manson after Wood’s allegations.</p>
<p>What it’s got to do with her, one has to wonder. There are some Johnny Depp fans that really don’t want to see Johnny dragged through the mud in the Manson case, but it seems that Heard is desperate to make sure that he is, by association.</p>
<p>In her meltdown, at one point, Heard goes off on somebody that calls her a fraud, telling them to shut up if they haven’t been in a situation where they were being strangled and fighting for their life. And, true to fashion, she did it using the tweenspeak trend of using numbers to abbreviate words, making it that much harder to take her accusations and vitriol seriously.</p>
<p>Is she now saying that she herself has been strangled? Are these new allegations she’s coming up with against Johnny Depp, or did she at one point say that he was strangling her while he was brutalizing her. Is that part of the testimony she gave behind closed doors? Or was that “just” about being brutally raped? Is there anything she won’t come up with to throw at Johnny Depp to try and make her case stick?</p>
<p>In another post, she continues her rage against rich white men, which some might say is rather ironic since those have been the type of men she’s spent her intimate time with. Or, perhaps she’s just talking about the ones that have rejected her.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard’s former assistant Kate James revealed that Heard stole her story of being raped. Is she now appropriating Wood’s story about being strangled?</p>

They're taken out of order, from different posts and different conversations, but they are her own words, so enjoy. </p>
<p>Heard amusingly refer to Johnny Depp fans as Wald-Mignons - referring to Depp's lawyer and friend Adam Waldman. I'm pretty sure she meant minions, but fell flat with the intended slight. One fan responded that Mignon actually means cute or pretty, ""...so, thanks.""</p>
<p>It seems that Heard is desperate at this point, especially with Depp’s appeal in the UK case looming so near in the future. We all thought we’d have to wait up to two years to hear anything else about that, but here it is, with a huge milestone in the case happening just next month.</p>
<p>Yes, she seems desperate. And with what could be a huge victory for Depp looming large on the very near horizon, it stands to reason that we'll likely see more from Heard, whether it's in the context of her own case or not. </p>

<p>Following a three-week trial in July last year, Mr. Justice Nicol ruled that Mr Depp, 57, assaulted Ms. Heard, 34, on a dozen occasions and put her in “fear for her life” at least three times.</p>
<p>Depp is challenging that ruling.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, Johnny Depp’s legal team is asking to submit new evidence that was previously unheard during the trial but has direct bearing upon Depp’s appeal request.</p>
<p>There’s some speculation among netizens as to what that evidence could be. Some hope for those salacious Toronto tapes, but more think that the new evidence has to do with proving that Heard lied about donating $7 million dollars to charity as a condition of their divorce. It was those charitable donations that caused Justice Nicol to decide that Heard was not a “gold digger.” If it can be proven that she didn’t donate the money, Nicol’s finding in that regard can definitely be challenged, and could affect whether or not Depp can continue with his appeal process.</p>
<p>There will be a two-hour hearing sometime between March 15th and 30th regarding that matter.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28469977,2021-02-02 00:02:36+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson,"<p>Evan Rachel wood has been talking for a couple of years about having been allegedly horribly abused by an ex. She spoke before panels and worked hard to try to reform domestic abuse laws.</p>
<p>Today, she came forward with the name of her <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/02/01/marilyn-manson-accused-horrifically-abusing-evan-rachel-wood/4335539001/#:~:text=Manson%2C%20in%20a%202009%20Q%26A,told%20the%20outlet%20of%20Wood."" rel=""nofollow"">alleged abuser: Marilyn Manson</a>. The two got together when Wood was in her teens and MM was in his thirties.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who immediately believe Wood because of her history of talking about this alleged abuse, and because Manson is just so weird. Also because he wrote in his autobiography that he used to be an abusive piece of shit and that he used to imagine crushing her skull with a sledgehammer. And for saying that the song “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies” was inspired by one of their breakups.</p>
<p>On top of that, four other women have stepped forward with similar accusations of their own against MM.</p>
<p>All of that, along with Wood’s disturbing allegations have a lot of people willing to crucify MM on the nearest telephone pole.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with Amber Heard or Aquaman 2? At first glance, nothing. But if we take a closer look, the associations abound.</p>
<p>First, ERW is “close” friends with Heard. Wood has come out in <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/Evan-Rachel-Wood-defends-Amber-Heard-amid-her-feud-with-Johnny-Depp/articleshow/53280392.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">support of Heard</a>’s allegations against Johnny Depp since Heard first started to allege them – which is just about the time that Wood started talking about being a victim of domestic abuse. Coincidence number one.</p>
<p>Also, it’s a pretty well-known fact that MM is (or was) best of buddies with Johnny Depp. The two of them haven’t been seen together in about a year, but they have a long history of being besties. Whether or not that’s still the case isn’t really known.</p>
<p>It’s also a fact that as far as I know, none of the women accusing MM ever called the police or filed any reports. The only word we have is in the media and on social media. I’m not saying that makes them liars, far from it. A lot of victims never report their abuse. Johnny Depp didn’t call the police. He relied upon his own private security to protect him.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is that the allegations against MM are pretty severe, with women saying they’ve been violently raped, had their lives threatened, were locked in closets, were beaten, even whipped, and more. With allegations so severe, it’s easy to wonder why the police weren’t called, at least by one of them. It would certainly make the allegations easier to swallow.</p>
<p>I’m also not saying MM didn’t do it. His own words in his autobiography don’t bode well for him, certainly.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that we need to wait and see some proof, one way or the other. Until that happens, all we have is a she-say/he-say situation.</p>
<p>It could come down in a number of ways. MM could be the heartless, sadistic monster his self-proclaimed victims say he is, and he should be locked up for life.</p>
<p>Or it could come down that the girls are in cahoots. Wood and Heard, I mean. The two of them, friends, have been alleging abuse against MM and Johnny Depp for roughly the same amount of time, and now would be a great time to come forward with MM’s name, what with the legalities between Heard and Johnny Depp shaping up the way they are. It’s not looking too good for Heard in the Fairfax, VA defamation case Johnny has leveled against her. So what better time to cut the legs out from under Johnny’s bff with allegations of even more monstrous abuse?</p>
<p>Or the two cases could have nothing whatsoever to do with each other but coincidence.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s too soon to call.</p>
<p>One thing that is a fact is that Amber Heard has made it more difficult for victims of either gender to come forward with their stories of abuse thanks to her lies about being abused. Her sh*tstorm of mainstream media stories and crusade through the #MeToo movement have made it nigh impossible for anybody to come forward without enduring intense scrutiny. Gone are the days when we could #BelieveAllWomen. Heard’s completely ruined that.</p>
<p>So yeah. While there is a faction ready to believe her outright, ERW is being looked at with some skepticism by a large contingency.</p>
<p>The only real truth here is that time will have to tell the truth of what’s going on. My suggestion is to neither believe nor deny these allegations against MM until there’s some shred of proof to back them up, or to prove that they’re false.</p>
<p>That’s what happened with Johnny Depp. He was accused of domestic abuse and a lot of people believed it. Then proof came out that those allegations were false.</p>
<p>That’s what I’m saying we should do here. Wait for some proof. Reserve judgement until we know definitively, one way or the other. The truth always outs, and it will in this case, too.</p>
<p>What do you think? Hang the dude’s reputation on her word? Or wait and see?</p>","{'id': '225158142', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/9/rl/ds/fMrlDSKhJQkHUzj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612224157', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>Jason Momoa's total net worth is reported to be $14 million, and that's combined with his wife, former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet's net worth. It's not impossible that Momoa was paid a figure in the millions, but it's not likely. </p>
<p>Let's take a look at some examples for comparison.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr, a talented and well-respected actor was reportedly paid $500 thousand for Iron Man. </p>
<p>Gal Gadot was reportedly paid $300 thousand for Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>These two were the stars of their movies. And we're supposed to believe that Amber Heard was paid $7 million for a supporting role? It's not impossible, I suppose. But I suspect that pigs would sooner fly.</p>
<p>The same magazine clip claims that Heard will probably make closer to $10 million for her part in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at that, too.</p>
<p>Sources have confirmed that Amber Heard will not be in Aquaman 2. She hasn't been fired, exactly. Word has it that she was never re-hired. Being bondable is one concern. Morals clause infringements might very well be another.</p>
<p>Rather, her contract has reportedly been bought out by WB. So, while she might have been paid for the project, she will likely not appear in it.</p>
<p>Like other stories about Amber Heard, I suspect that this one is greatly exaggerated. </p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard dipped in gold and worth millions? Or is she on her way out the door from Hollywood?</p>","{'id': '225152561', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/3/bq/tt/uLbQtToFGCFlEYl-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612123406', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>Remember when Johnny Depp wanted to make arrangements for the trial to allow for his filming of FB? Heard successfully argued against it, refusing to let the court make any such allowances for him. That might, in part, have been why Johnny Depp was asked to step down from the franchise. His filming schedule would have been interrupted - partly by that three-day deposition she made him sit for that conflicted with filming.</p>
<p>Well, now the shoe is on the other foot.</p>
<p>Because of court's Covid-related scheduling conflicts, the case may very well be pushed back into what she claims will be HER filming schedule. And, since she already argued against scheduling court around filming for him, the same applies to her. </p>
<p>If .court couldn't be rescheduled for him, it can't be rescheduled for her.</p>
<p>Sauce for the gander is just as good for the goose.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of fact that filming for Aquaman 2 will take place in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to smuggling her dogs into Australia. </p>
<p>Given both of these circumstances, and the fact that reliable sources report that her contract has been bought out, chances are very slim (see what I did there?) that Heard will appear in Aquaman 2.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28408750,2021-01-22 17:08:35+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Both Toxic?,"<p>I still see people using the argument that both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were toxic and violent. So, the theory goes, it's a wash.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we? </p>
<p>Amber Heard recorded conversations with herself and ex Johnny Depp, in which she calls him a baby for ducking out of fights. She criticizes him harshly for leaving every single fight, admonishing him for not staying and fighting.</p>
<p>She also admits to being the one that starts physical fights. Johnny answers that when things get physical, they have to separate, and she berates him again, daring him to tell the world that he's a victim because nobody will believe him.</p>
<p>If you can tolerate listening to Johnny being verbally abused and gaslit, you can hear the conversation <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7947733/Amber-Heard-admits-hitting-ex-husband-Johnny-Depp-pelting-pots-pans-tape.html"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>. </p>
<p>Now, you tell me. Does it sound like the action of a violent man to leave whenever fights get physical, started by Heard, by her own admission?</p>
<p>Of course not. But there are people out there that want to believe Heard because she's a woman, or who haven't bothered to educate themselves to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>That's why Johnny's case is so important. Not just to clear his own name, but to clear a path for abused men to be able to come forward as victims and be believed.</p>

<p>For example, this picture was taken 2 days after Amber claims Johnny Depp knelt on her back and was hitting her, slapping her, and pulling her hair. Do you see any injuries? Nope. Me neither.</p>
<p>This picture also flies in the face of Heard's testimony that Johnny didn't let her wear anything too revealing when they were together.</p>

<p>There's a subpoena issued for ""an executive"" from Disney, seeking: “all information relating to documents and communications of any nature” on Depp and “incidents of drug or alcohol use (including suspected drug or alcohol use).” Similarly, they are looking for any information about “any delays or tardiness caused by Mr. Depp,” “any incidents of violence or abuse by Mr. Depp,” any info on impute the actor had or “hiring, casting,” and “disagreements with the writers, directors or producers with the filming, editing and/or release of Pirates 5.”</p>
<p>There's a subpoena out for the LAPD as well, wanting: everything that the police have on file regarding a May altercation between Heard and Depp that led to Heard receiving a restraining order against Depp. And they mean everything. Any correspondence, body cam footage, everything. </p>
<p>Heard insists that the final altercation between herself and Johnny Depp was Depp's fault because he was physically and verbally abusing her. Johnny insists that the altercation never happened, that it's a hoax perpetrated by Heard and her close circle of friends.</p>
<p>If body cam footage of the police's response exists, it could go a long way toward proving one position or the other. </p>
<p>The court date is looming ever nearer. We'll have to wait and see how this one goes. If you remember Johnny lost a libel suit against the Sun because the judge said he believed Heard. </p>
<p>That case is under appeal, so we'll have to see how that one turns out, too. It's not over for Johnny in either case. Not by a long shot. He is determined to clear his name, and there is an army of fans worldwide that support him wholeheartedly. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28328823,2021-01-08 16:13:57+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,Heard's missing Donations,"<p>As part of her divorce settlement, Amber Heard pledged to donate her entire 7 million dollar settlement to charity. Namely, to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Heard has said in numerous interviews in the last several years that the money was donated, split between those two charities. She also testified to it under oath, under penalty of Perjury.</p>
<p>Well, lately, things have gotten really interesting. Turns out the only contribution that’s been made to the Children’s hospital was the original $100,000 Johnny Depp made on her behalf. And there’s no proof of what, if anything, Amber Heard donated to the ACLU herself. Apparently there have been donations made on her behalf, but no proof that she, herself, donated a single red cent.</p>
<p>For one thing, it was part of a legally binding contract (her divorce), that she would donate that money. For another thing, she testified under penalty of perjury that she donated it.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the penalty for Perjury in the UK is up to 7 years in prison. Pile that on top of perjury charges she’s being investigated for in Australia, and those years are really starting to pile up on her.</p>
<p>In a truly amusing turn of events, Amber Heard, through her lawyer, is now claiming that she can’t make those donations because of Johnny’s ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>""However, Amber has been delayed in that goal because Mr. Depp filed a lawsuit against her, and consequently, she has been forced to spend millions of dollars defending Mr. Depp's false accusations against her.""</p>
<p>And never mind that Heard was supposed to have made those donations 3 years before he ever filed suit against her.</p>
<p>Heard plans to fulfill those donations “eventually,” her lawyer says.</p>
<p>So, basically, Heard’s defense against being accused of not paying 7 million dollars to charity is to admit that she didn’t pay 7 million dollars to charity, and blame it on Johnny.</p>
<p>Keep on digging, Amber. Keep on digging.</p>

<p>The court in Fairfax, VA has issued an <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/opinions/cl-2019-2911-depp-v-heard-01-24-21.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Opinion Letter</a> dismissing most of Amber Heard’s counterclaim, and upholding only a few bits of it. But the parts where she mentions this petition say that:</p>
<p>“The allegations that “Mr. Depp has initiated, coordinated, overseen and/or supported and amplified two change.org petitions: one to remove Ms. Heard as an actress in the Aquaman movie franchise, and one to remove her as a  spokeswoman for L’Oreal” fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See Countercl. Paragraph 6. Nothing in that allegation implies facts showing that the change.org petitions included obscene language, threatened illegal or immoral acts, or suggest or propose obscene acts. See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Likewise, the allegation that Mr. Depp “created, coordinated, controlled, and/or manipulated social media accounts created specifically for the purpose of targeting Ms. Heard,” also fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See VA code 18.2-152.7:1. The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Because neither of those allegations meet the second element of the VCCA, they cannot move forward in this litigation.”</p>
<p>So the court didn’t buy all that nonsense about Johnny Depp  being responsible for these petition and all us “Russian bots.” So even the court recognizes how ridiculous that claim was.</p>
<p>The only bummer about it is that now, I probably won’t be called to testify that Johnny Depp had nothing to do with the creation or maintenance of this petition. I was kind of looking forward to that.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to the letter, addressing more about Heard's counterclaim, but that's the part that deals with this petition.</p>
