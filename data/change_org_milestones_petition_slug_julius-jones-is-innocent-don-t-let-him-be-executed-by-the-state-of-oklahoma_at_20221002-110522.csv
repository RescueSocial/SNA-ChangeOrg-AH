StarterPetitionUpdate,30898559,2022-09-07T20:59:48.000Z,Help Us Save Others on Oklahoma's Death Row,"<p>Friend,</p>
<p>You may have already seen this update. But as someone invested in the liberation of Julius Jones, an innocent Black man who you helped free from death row last year, we wanted to make sure you had an opportunity to learn what's happening in Oklahoma right now and take action.</p>
<p>Twenty five people have been set to be killed by the state. One person, James Coddington, was already killed two weeks ago despite the Oklahoma Parole and Pardon's board voting for clemency.</p>
<p>Governor Stitt ignored his own appointed Parole and Pardons board, and chose death instead!</p>
<p>The people scheduled for execution include cases with serious claims of innocence and racial bias, just like Julius’ case. Others include severe mental illness, intellectual disability, exorbitant childhood trauma and abuse. These cases reveal deep systemic flaws in Oklahoma’s capital punishment system and illustrate the egregious unfairness and cruelty of the death penalty in general.</p>
<p>But it's never too late. If enough people make noise, we can push Governor Stitt to issue a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
<p>TAKE ACTION NOW - SIGN THE PETITION!</p>

<p><br>It’s been almost 1 year since you and 6 million others around the country took action to help successfully stop the execution of Julius Jones! We’re reaching out on behalf of Julius today to request your help to save lives in Oklahoma once again. </p>
<p><br>Right now there are 25 people scheduled for execution in Oklahoma. We can stop these executions by once again pushing the Governor to take action and issue a moratorium on the death penalty. </p>
<p><br><a href=""http://bit.ly/oklahoma25"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Sign the petition</a>: Governor Stitt, please issue a death penalty moratorium and save the lives of 25 people today!</p>
<p><br>Together we helped save Julius, a Black man who has spent the past 20 years on death row for a crime he did not commit. Though Julius is no longer on death row, he’s still serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole despite being innocent. Our fight for Julius’s liberation is not over. But as we continue to strategize for Julius’ freedom, we must also work to shut down the death penalty system that threatened his life in the first place. </p>
<p><br>The 25 people scheduled for execution include cases with serious claims of innocence and racial bias, just like Julius’ case. Others include severe mental illness, intellectual disability, exorbitant childhood trauma and abuse. These cases reveal deep systemic flaws in Oklahoma’s capital punishment system and illustrate the egregious unfairness and cruelty of the death penalty in general. </p>
<p><br>Together we can end the cruelty of Oklahoma’s death penalty. </p>
<p><br>Mama Jones, Antoinette Jones, Jabee Williams, and me - Cece Jones-Davis, continue to fight for justice for Julius and others impacted by the death penalty in Oklahoma because we know too well how evil this system is. We believe that the only way to be certain that the state never puts another innocent person on death row again, is to stop this death machine all together. </p>
<p><br>This is why we’ve teamed up with death row exonerees from the organization, Witness to Innocence to implore Governor Stitt to issue a moratorium on the Oklahoma death penalty TODAY. </p>

<p>You ventured with us through the unimaginable at the end of 2021. Julius Jones' life was spared just hours before the scheduled execution, and we are relieved that he is alive.

StarterPetitionUpdate,29782275,2021-10-29T16:05:57.000Z,UPDATE: The Supreme Court’s ruling on Julius Jones’ case,"<p>Friends - A lot has happened in Julius’ case over the last few days. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>On Wednesday, Julius Jones and John Grant were granted a stay of execution by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit due to questions around the constitutionality of Oklahoma’s execution process.</li>
<li>The State of Oklahoma appealed that decision and it went to the Supreme Court.</li>
<li>Then yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-3 to move forward with the executions.</li>
<li>This resulted in the execution of John Grant. It did not go well, and proved why Oklahoma’s lethal injection process is being challenged—and Julius could be next.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Julius’ November 18th execution date is back on and his clemency hearing will be held on Monday, November 1st at 9am CT. We’re looking forward to the opportunity for Julius to finally be heard and present the case for his innocence for the first time in over 20 years.</p>
<p>We pray that the Pardon and Parole Board will hear the truth and recommend to Governor Stitt that he grant Julius clemency.</p>
<p>This is truly Julius’ last chance to stop his execution. Now more than ever, we need as many people as possible to make their voices heard—<a href=""https://p2a.co/bgmivzn?p2asource=em_20211029-ct-RJT-jjscotusupdate-actives&amp;emci=6f5ca2d7-4438-ec11-9820-c896653b26c8&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">contact the Board and Governor Stitt right now and tell them you want justice for Julius.</a> Then share this link with your friends and family and encourage them to do the same.</p>

<p>It is truly shocking—and, quite frankly, outrageous and cruel—that the promise of a fair hearing, which former AG Mike Hunter agreed Julius has a right to, might now be short-circuited because of this rush to resume executions. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29458544,2021-08-13T18:46:42.000Z,One month to save Julius Jones,"<p>For over 20 years, Julius Jones has been on death row in Oklahoma for a crime another man has reportedly confessed to committing. But in one month, that could change.</p>
<p>On September 13th, Julius will have a commutation hearing in front of the Oklahoma Pardon &amp; Parole Board. He’s exhausted all of his court appeals, so this really is his last shot at justice.</p>
<p>Over the next month, we need to do everything we can to help Julius get the freedom he deserves. So today, <a href=""https://www.votervoice.net/mobile/OKCATHOLIC/Campaigns/86855/Respond?p2asource=em_20210813-ct-CJD-onemonthout-actives&amp;ms=em_20210813-ct-CJD-onemonthout-actives&amp;emci=01fe855e-b6fa-eb11-b563-501ac57b8fa7&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">I’m asking you to contact the Pardon &amp; Parole Board and tell them you support Julius’ fight for justice.</a></p>
<p>Look, when I started the Justice for Julius petition on Change.org, I never thought it would turn into a much larger movement. More than six million people have signed the petition and over 50,000 letters have been sent to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board—all in an effort to free Julius.</p>
<p>But we can’t let up now. We have to keep this momentum going as we head into the final month of this fight.</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29183530,2021-06-09T17:46:55.000Z,Join us Friday for the live Justice for Julius Campaign Update,"<p><em>A message from Julius Jones' sister, Antoinette Jones:</em></p>
<p>For the past 21 years, my brother Julius Jones has been on death row in Oklahoma for a murder he did not commit. He was at home eating dinner with our family at the time of the crime. But the truth was no match for racial discrimination in our justice system and a shoddy legal defense, and my innocent big brother was sentenced to death.</p>
<p>It’s been more than two decades since I’ve been able to give Julius a hug—but thanks to organizations like Represent Justice that are giving my brother’s case a platform, I am so hopeful that we can finally get him out. In this fight to bring him home to us, every minute counts.</p>
<p>This Friday, June 11 at 11 a.m. CT, Represent Justice and the Justice for Julius campaign are hosting a live campaign update about the next steps we'll take to help my brother. We’ll be joined by more members of the Jones family, Julius' legal team, and faith and community leaders. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/502563524417850/?emci=30fa9ef2-8cc8-eb11-a7ad-501ac57b8fa7&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">It will all be streamed on the Represent Justice Facebook page, and I’d love for you to join—will you RSVP now?</a></p>
<p>Building awareness for my brother’s case this summer is crucial because he has a commutation (lessening his sentence or even releasing him on time served) hearing on September 13th that could save his life—and because he’s exhausted all of his appeals, this is his last chance at freedom.</p>
<p>But despite everything, Julius, myself, and our family are keeping hope in our hearts. More than six million people have signed a petition calling for justice, and thousands have written the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board on behalf of my brother. And now, athletes and celebrities are calling for justice for Julius. Knowing we’re not in this alone helps me get up every morning and continue the fight.</p>
<p>I’m truly so grateful for all the support—but we can’t let up. So please, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/502563524417850/?emci=30fa9ef2-8cc8-eb11-a7ad-501ac57b8fa7&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">join us for the Justice for Julius Campaign Update, live on Friday, June 11 at 11 a.m. CT on the Represent Justice Facebook page.</a></p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28681805,2021-03-10T01:48:14.000Z,Our Prayers are Answered,"<p>Earlier this week, our prayers for Julius Jones and his family were answered. In a 3-1 decision, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted to grant Julius Jones a ""stage two"" commutation hearing, where he will be able to present the case for his innocence. </p>
<p>As you may know, Julius' defense team recently shared <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLYzd1n5CzI"" rel=""nofollow"">new evidence</a> of his innocence, including a sworn affidavit from a man who says that Jones’ codefendant, Christopher Jordan, confessed to the murder Jones is on death row for (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLYzd1n5CzI"" rel=""nofollow"">watch this video for more information</a>).</p>
<p>We believe that compelling new evidence, combined with the tens of thousands of emails, calls and letters from people like you, helped to convince the Parole Board to do the right thing. We also know the fight to save Julius isn't over.</p>
<p>In the next few months, we will need your help even more. Please <a href=""https://oneclickpolitics.global.ssl.fastly.net/messages/edit?promo_id=7177"" rel=""nofollow"">continue to write the Pardon and Parole Board</a>, so they know the world is watching their next decision. Share social media content like <a href=""https://youtu.be/JLYzd1n5CzI"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> that outlines the case for Julius' innocence. And, of course we need your prayers, encouragement and love while we work together to take on a system that is committed to carrying out this execution regardless of Julius' innocence or the evidence in his favor. <br> </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Julius' sister Antoinette had this to say to the media: <em>""My family knows Julius is not guilty because we were with Julius at our house when the murder occurred. We never got to tell that story, and the truth about Julius has been buried for a long time. Now, finally, that truth may come out.”</em></p>
<p>I am heartbroken for Antoinette and her family, who have been through so much. But I am also encouraged and inspired by their resolve and I am committed to making sure that the truth does indeed see the light of day. I know you are too. Together, we will ensure the truth comes out because we know the truth will set Julius for free. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28149822,2020-12-01T14:49:34.000Z,Help Save Julius' Life on #GivingTuesday,"<p>Last week, while many of us celebrated with friends and family, Julius Jones spent Thanksgiving in a cell waiting an execution date from the state of Oklahoma for a crime he did not commit. It was the twenty-first Thanksgiving he has spent on death row. <br> <br>Despite this injustice, Julius wants you to know he has a lot to be thankful for.

StarterPetitionUpdate,27930535,2020-10-21T20:32:37.000Z,"For Exonerees, ""The Sun Does Shine""","<p>This Friday at 6 PM CST we hope you can join us for a very special <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/justice4juliusjones"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook Live</a> conversation with Anthony Ray Hinton. Anthony was wrongfully accused of murdering two fast-food restaurant managers and served 28 years on death row in Alabama before his exoneration. He was played by O’Shea Jackson Jr. in the film “Just Mercy.” The film, starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx, follows attorney Brian Stevenson as he fights for the wrongly imprisoned — including Hinton.</p>
<p>Anthony’s case parallels Julius’ in so many ways. He was represented by an inexperienced, overwhelmed and underprepared public defender. He was convicted despite having a strong alibi (Hinton’s boss says he was at work when the murders took place; Julius’ parents say he was at home). In both cases, the state’s charges rested largely on “junk” forensic science that has since been disproven.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they are similar in the ways that the system was designed to protect itself, even in the face of obvious errors. The problems with Anthony’s case were so glaring that when he was finally granted a retrial by the U.S. Supreme Court, a new judge dismissed all charges and let him go free. For decades before that, however, the system ignored new evidence, swept contradictory testimony under the rug, and worked to cover its tracks – at the expense of Anthony’s freedom.</p>
<p>This Friday at 6 PM SCT, Anthony will join us <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/justice4juliusjones"" rel=""nofollow"">on Facebook</a> to share his thoughts on Julius Jones and what he learned from his long fight for justice. We hope you will <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/justice4juliusjones"" rel=""nofollow"">join us</a> and, while you’re at it, <a href=""https://oneclickpolitics.global.ssl.fastly.net/messages/edit?promo_id=7177"" rel=""nofollow"">write an email</a> of support to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board and Governor Kevin Stitt.</p>
<p>When Anthony was released from prison, one of the first thing he said to reporters and the public was “The sun does shine.” It is our greatest hope that through our activism and advocacy, Julius can have his own moment in the sun, as a free man, with his family.</p>",,,,
StarterPetitionUpdate,27890205,2020-10-14T18:52:39.000Z,One More Year Without Justice,"<p>Tomorrow marks one year since Julius Jones filed his commutation application with the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. A commutation hearing – where Julius can tell his side of the story and present the evidence of his innocence – is Julius’ best hope of getting off of death row.</p>
<p>Julius spends 23 hours a day alone in his cell and has now served over 21 years behind bars for a crime he didn’t commit. His only way of communicating with the outside world and telling his story is through people like YOU.</p>
<p>That’s why tomorrow we are asking all of Julius’ supporters to take the following three steps on the one-year anniversary of Julius’ commutation application being filed:</p>

<p>We also invite you to join us at 6 PM CST tomorrow on our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/justiceforjulius/"" rel=""nofollow"">Instagram page</a> to hear a LIVE conversation with Jimmy Lawson, Julius’ best friend, and Irv Roland, an activist and NBA trainer. They’ll share their thoughts on Julius, the criminal justice system, and what we can do to help right this terrible wrong.</p>

That includes over 6 million signatures on our Change.org petition as well as over 16,000 letters sent to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board and Governor Kevin Stitt (if you haven’t sent a letter yet, please do so <a href=""https://oneclickpolitics.global.ssl.fastly.net/messages/edit?promo_id=7177"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>!).</p>
<p>It has also included the support of several high-profile celebrities and athletes who have chosen to use their platform and fame as tools to fight injustice. The latest is Cleveland Browns Quarterback (and former University of Oklahoma sensation and Heisman trophy winner) Baker Mayfield. Baker has made the decision to wear Julius’ name on the back of his helmet this season and to use his post-game press conferences to speak out on Julius’ behalf. We want to offer our sincere thanks to him for his leadership and his fearlessness.</p>
<p>In fact, Julius was so moved by Baker’s actions that he has asked us to share the message below:</p>
<p><em>“Thank you to Baker Mayfield, who has spoken on issues of inequality, criminal justice and race, and  had the courage to speak up for me.  I know that advocating for someone in my position can be difficult, but Baker did it anyway because he felt called to take a stand.  I am thankful to Baker and the many who are lending their voices and their prayers to my family and me as we work to correct this injustice.”</em> - Julius Jones  </p>
<p>Standing up for what’s right isn’t always easy, and we are so grateful that people are willing to put their names and reputations on the line for this cause.</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/justice4juliusjones"" rel=""nofollow"">tune-in</a> to our Facebook Live Friday tomorrow (9/18) night at 6PM CST. We will be hearing from, Nancy Vollertsen, whose brother Greg spent five years on Oklahoma's death row for the brutal murder of his wife before being exonerated. Like Julius, Nancy’s brother spent 23 hours a day in a cell by himself while waiting to be executed. He was eventually released from prison without so much as an apology from the state. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/justice4juliusjones"" rel=""nofollow"">Join us</a> tomorrow to hear Nancy’s story and why she’s now fighting for Julius’ life and his release from prison.</p>","{'id': '224603653', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/5/sr/ea/PisrEaZaPGagCRX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1600366685', 'processing': False}}",,,

<p>Last week we heard from Jennifer Thompson, author of “Picking Cotton” and Board President for <a href=""https://healingjusticeproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Healing Justice</a>. Jennifer has a unique perspective as the victim of a violent rape who wrongly identified her perpetrator, Ronald Cotton, who was imprisoned and later exonerated. We talked about what it’s like to navigate the criminal justice system as the victim of a terrible crime and how she came to terms with mistakenly identifying an innocent man. Jennifer has written Gov. Stitt on Julius’ behalf, and we greatly appreciated her sharing her story.

<p>Today I am excited to announce that we will be talking to <a href=""https://www.representjustice.org/speakers/fernando-bermudez/"" rel=""nofollow"">Fernando Bermudez</a>, a man who spent 18 years in prison for a murder he did not commit before being exonerated and released. Fernando was proven innocent in late 2009 with help from pro bono attorneys in Washington, D.C., New Jersey and New York. Mr. Bermudez’s exoneration makes him the first Latin-American male in NY-state legal history exonerated on “actual innocence” grounds. The sole evidence against him involved mistaken and coerced eyewitness identification by five teenagers, who later recanted their testimony.</p>

<p>As we wait for a commutation hearing, we are continuing to shed light on Julius’ case and do everything we can to draw attention to his innocence. Last week, we were joined on Facebook by Tulsa-based Private Investigator Eric Cullen, who talked about why he has gotten involved in this case.</p>
<p>Cullen worked for over 14 years to exonerate three Tulsa men who were wrongfully convicted of murder. He sees similarities between those cases and Julius, including “young, black men with limited resources” convicted after “shoddy, incomplete investigations” and “the testimony of questionable witnesses incentivized to lie for their own self-preservation.” In a letter to Governor Stitt and the Parole Board, Eric wrote: “Based on my extensive experience with these cases and a review of Julius’ case, I’m confident Julius is as innocent as these men, and he deserves his freedom.”     </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,27491111,2020-08-10T18:09:44.000Z,TIME for Justice,"<p>Thank you for your interest in saving the life of Julius Jones, an innocent man on death row in Oklahoma. </p>
<p>What started as a few men and women in Oklahoma, determined to shed light on Julius’ case, has now blossomed into a national movement. Today we have over 6 million signatures on Change.org supporting Julius. Over 71,000 letters have been sent to Oklahoma’s Pardon and Parole Board asking for Julius’ commutation (if you haven’t sent a letter yet, please <a href=""https://oneclickpolitics.global.ssl.fastly.net/messages/edit?promo_id=7177"" rel=""nofollow"">click here to do so</a>). The influential news show “20/20” aired a two-hour special documenting the incompetence, prosecutorial misconduct, and racism that defined Julius’ trial. And people all across the country – from Kim Kardashian-West to Russell Westbrook to everyday folks like you and me are talking about Julius Jones and what we can do to bring him home to his family.</p>
<p>Those conversations are having an impact. We now believe Julius Jones WILL be given a commutation hearing later this year. Between now and then, we have a lot of work to do. In the coming weeks, we will be sending out updates with news on Julius and his case, “Fact vs. Fiction” memos to set the record straight, and other content you can share and pass on to your friends and family.</p>
<p>We are excited that our first such update is a piece of great news. Dallas Cowboys Quarterback Dak Prescott has weighed in with an emotional, heartfelt letter to Gov. Kevin Stitt asking him to commute Julius’ sentence, and <a href=""https://time.com/5875257/dak-prescott-dallas-cowboys-julius-jones/"" rel=""nofollow"">TIME.com</a> has written a <a href=""https://time.com/5875257/dak-prescott-dallas-cowboys-julius-jones/"" rel=""nofollow"">great piece</a> on Dak’s involvement.</p>

<p><em>Dear Governor Stitt and Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board Members,</em></p>
<p><em>I am writing to express my wholehearted support of Julius Jones’ commutation application.</em></p>
<p><em>As a black man in this country right now, I experience injustices firsthand day in and day out, even as an athlete with “celebrity status.” Current events are shining a much-needed light on deep-seated prejudices and systemic mistreatment of black people, and it is my sincere hope that the cultural movements of today will lead to significant social changes that will create a better tomorrow. To that end, you all are in the unique position of being able to make a direct impact by addressing a specific miscarriage of justice.</em></p>
<p><em>After reviewing the facts of the Julius Jones case, I firmly believe the wrong person is being punished for this terrible crime; furthermore, an evaluation of the process that led to Mr. Jones’ conviction raises serious legal and ethical concerns. I implore you to right this wrong. Please don’t let another innocent black man die from the systemic mistreatment that has plagued our nation for far too long.</em></p>
<p><em>It is my firm belief that Julius Jones’ conviction and death sentence is an egregious injustice. Mr. Jones has been on death row for 20 years, despite written affidavits from his trial lawyers describing the ways they failed him in court. Mr. Jones’ attorneys never presented the photo taken 9 days prior to the crime that could have provided clarity about the shooter’s description. They were appointed without having any experience in death penalty cases, and did not even present Mr. Jones’ alibi at trial. In addition, a member of the jury (comprised of 11 white members out of 12) has confirmed that the jury acted with racial animus – admitting that inappropriate and biased statements were made by other jurors during the trial, including the use of racial slurs.</em></p>
<p><em>The treatment of Julius Jones is the kind of miscarriage of justice African American men like myself live in fear of, and that is why I feel compelled to use the influence that God has blessed me with to speak up for what I believe is right and to give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves. Julius Jones’ case is a clear example of what can happen to a person who cannot afford legal representation, and what can happen to a black person at any time in this country – which is exactly why so many are protesting for the changes we so desperately need. I ask for you to please do your part to help bring about this change by giving thoughtful and sincere consideration to your review of Julius Jones’ commutation application. My prayer is that he is able to salvage what remains of his life and that, through the righting of a decades-old wrong, he will be restored to his family soon.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
