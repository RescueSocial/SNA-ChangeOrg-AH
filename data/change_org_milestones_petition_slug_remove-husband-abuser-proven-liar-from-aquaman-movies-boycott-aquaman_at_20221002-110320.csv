<p>Do you know what this will mean?  That this will force Johnny to relive all of the horrors of when he had to live through that horrific time of being married to that banshee of a horrible creature  all over again and that ridiculous trial again that he should have never had to go through to begin with, that he will have to 'hear her story'  that we will ALL have to hear 'her story' again.  We cannot let this happen again.</p>
<p>We must all gather our friends, and make WARNER BROTHERS, JASON MOMOA, AND THAT DIRECTOR realize that this disease A.Heard does not need to be in the movie to survive.  There are many MANY other much more talented actresses out there that can and will be willing to fill the shoes of Queen Mera.  Even Bill Campbell has been said to toss the script his way!</p>
<p>How would it look to Warner Bros. if the movie sunk due to them not listening to all of us?  Maybe then they will wish they had listened and kick her to the curb once and for all.  Its not right for her to get away with what she did.  Help get justice for Johnny.  Warner Bros kicked him to the curb based on the LIES A.H. said about him anyway..........so she needs to lose out as well!</p>","{'id': '226705783', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/7/ry/qw/oBrYqWAplFIMwEC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1655918607', 'processing': False}}",,,
