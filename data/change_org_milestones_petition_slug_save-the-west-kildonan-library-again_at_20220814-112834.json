We must band together and save West Kildonan Library.\u00a0<strong>Please share this petition with your friends and family. Call and email the city councillors below. </strong>Every effort helps to save our library from closure!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Part of the City's proposal includes opening an experimental branch within Garden City Shopping Centre\u2014<strong>without a single window or source of natural light.</strong> The proposed space is wedged behind Bulk Barn and other retailers, making it unattractive for businesses, having been vacant for over 5 years since the mall redevelopment. There will not be a dedicated exterior entrance and relegates our community library to a space completely controlled by for-profit private enterprises.\u00a0<strong>How can a library exist without proper entrances, windows, daylight or greenspace?</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal would remove library services from our community and place them in the middle of a commercial district, far from most residents. <strong>Most importantly, this proposal puts our library further away from schools, pedestrians, child care centres and seniors.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is a bad deal for taxpayers.</strong> In addition to losing city-owned property in West Kildonan, the City wants to <strong>spend $2 million on constructing a library within space it does not own</strong> and will be forced to pay a monthly lease.\u00a0This is all an attempt to make the mall's most undesirable retail space into a second class library branch. Think of what $2 million could do towards the existing library. Or what $2 million plus 10 years of lease payments could construct for a new library? <strong>In total, over $6.5m of taxpayer dollars will be handed to private developers as part of this library plan.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why should we be forced to give up West Kildonan Library in favour of a second-class library branch?</strong> The existing library is already owned by the citizens of Winnipeg. Why are we willing to hand our libraries over to private developers?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>We agree that West Kildonan and Garden City deserves a reinvestment in our library services.</strong> Northwest Winnipeg is growing, but services for new developments should not come at the expense of our neighbourhoods.<strong> City Hall has indicated that this proposal is their new template to cut neighbourhood library branches and centralize them within small, inacessible commercial outlets.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>West Kildonan and Garden City deserve the same library services as the rest of the city, including the new, stand-alone branches recently constructed River Heights, Windsor Park or Transcona. <strong>We do not deserve less.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Please contact City Council and let them know you oppose this misguided and short-sighted proposal. <strong>Emails and phone calls are important!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Committee Voting on Proposal:\u00a0\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p>Cindy Gilroy: cgilroy@winnipeg.ca | 204-986-5951 (Committee Chair)</p>\n<p>Kevin Klein: kklein@winnipeg.ca | 204-986-5232 (Committee Member)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vivian Santos: vsantos@winnipeg.ca | 204-986-8401 (Committee Member)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Janica Lukes: jlukes@winnipeg.ca | 204-986-6824\u00a0(Committee Member)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Area Councillors:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Councillor Devi Sharma: devi@winnipeg.ca | 204-986-5264\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coucillor Ross Eadie: readie@winnipeg.ca 204-986-5188</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mayor Brian Bowman:</strong></em></p>\n<p>bbowman@winnipeg.ca OR mayorbowman@winnipeg.ca | 204-986-5665</p>", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": {"providerName": "CBC", "photoUrl": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.6440273.1651614225!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/west-kildonan-library.jpg", "description": "The City of Winnipeg is preparing to close the book on the first stand-alone home of the West Kildonan Library.

A few updates on our efforts to save the West Kildonan Library. It has been a very busy week and I would like to give you some updates.</p>\n<p>Firstly, thank you for taking time to sign and share the petition. Together, we have reached 5,800+ signature in less than 5 days!</p>\n<p>This Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet with Councillors at City Hall and give a presentation to the committee reviewing West Kildonan Library's closure. I presented our petition (so far) and 30+ letters from our residents firmly against this closure. CTV and a few other local media outlets covered my presentation and it has helped share our story with residents across Winnipeg.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may not know, but City Hall is now wanting to also cut funding for a second library that has been proposed for North Winnipeg. In\u00a02013 City Council approved funding for a second, new library in North Winnipeg. City Hall now wants to cut that funding AND still close West Kildonan Library.\u00a0</p>\n<p>City Hall heard loud and clear that our residents will not accept losing the funding for this proposed library and also closing the only other library we have. It is unfair and inequitable to leave our North Winnipeg residents with no library services. Nearby Old Kildonan Councillor, Devi Sharma, has been very supportive of our efforts to save West Kildonan Library and opposes the closure and cuts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To keep fighting this closure and cuts, please email the Mayor and all City Councillors to let them know you want to keep the West Kildonan Library. You can also let them know they need to restore funding for the second North Winnipeg library.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please continue to tell your friends, families and neighbours to sign the petition. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in joining our efforts, I also love hearing from other concerned residents.
