StarterPetitionUpdate,29485985,2021-08-19T19:06:26.000Z,,Depp gets a legal victory!,"<p>Johnny Depp was handed a legal win on Tuesday 08/17/2021 when a Virginia judge refused to dismiss his $50 million defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard. Sanctions were however, denied.</p>
<p>This is a great win for Johnny Depp, however, there’s still no word as to when, or if, Minamata movie will be released in the US. Johnny Depp &amp; the victims of Minamata deserve to have this movie, and it’s incredibly important story released! <br><br></p>
<p>Please take the time to share this on your socials, and ask others to sign and share as well! Thank you so much for your time and support thus far, and as we continue forward!</p>","{'id': '225862281', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/hy/na/oZhYNahsyLmxZrT-800x450-noPad.jpg?1629399989', 'processing': False}}",,

StarterPetitionUpdate,29399123,2021-07-30T17:45:46.000Z,,"1,300!!","<p>I wanted to stop by to post an update— we are 5 signatures away from 1,300, and counting! You guys are truly, truly incredible. I know I thanked the JFJD community, but I also know that there are others who genuinely want to see the movie to truly understand the crimes that happened to the people of Minamata. We cannot let them bury this, and silence those that suffered Minamata disease, some of whom are <strong><em>STILL SUFFERING</em></strong>! </p>
<p>I believe we can hit 1,500 by the end of the day. That’s the goal I’d like to set for us, anyway. The more signatures we get, the bigger the likelihood of MGM seeing our plea to release Minamata in the US, but we need your help to accomplish this. Can you please help me in sharing this petition with 10 people today? It would mean so much!!</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance, and we will touch base again soon ����<br><br></p>

<p>There’s so many wonderful people in the Justice for Johnny Depp community, and each and every one of you are truly cherished and appreciated. However, we know this issue goes far beyond the JFJD cause. In addition to Mr. Depp, we are also fighting for the victims of Minamata.</p>
<p>Please help keep the momentum by sharing on your socials! If enough of us sign we can’t be ignored! </p>
