Standard language across the board says all uses must remain in soundproof buildings with no outside areas allowed. If the animal hospital or pet boarding facility has outside exercise areas, they are required by law to be in C-3 (heavy commercial where some outside noise and minor fumes associated with the business are allowed or in Industrial Zoning. I've checked Gulf Breeze, Santa Rosa County, Escambia County, Mobile, Fairhope, and other historic cities such as Savannah, St. Augustine, New Orleans. It looks very much like across the country, it's a standard rule of where you put these types of businesses.   We have even heard from other vet clinics in the city that there is no reason that a clinic or boarding facility needs to have outdoor areas.  \nThank you for everyone who has helped research all the information on this project!", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "22758979", "createdAt": "2018-05-17T16:56:28.000Z", "title": "Negative reactions from clients of East Hill Animal Hospital", "description": "Hello wonderful supporters,\nA petition in opposition of our petition has been created recently.  This petition is pretty negative in the fact that it states \n\u201cAlthough the legalities of the situation will not be presented here, we want Dr. Hall to know that many of us are opposed to the harassment that is being given to Dr. Hall by some residents and a particular Preservation District in the same area\u201d\nWe have never harassed Dr. Hall or her businesses and feel that this is an undeserved portrayal of our group of people who believe a code change would be harmful to our neighborhood.  We have done our absolute best to be fact based and composed when discussing this issue.  Please share our petition if you haven\u2019t already.  I am also collecting letters to pass on to City Council so if you feel strongly please send me your letters at amber.hoverson@oldeasthill.com.  Thank you all so much!    \n\nAmber", "photo": {"id": "220618864", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/0/zx/gc/HDZXgCSTZmYSZcr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1526576190", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "22741534", "createdAt": "2018-05-13T03:09:02.000Z", "signatureCount": 200}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "22724953", "createdAt": "2018-05-08T17:46:04.000Z", "title": "City Council Meeting June 14", "description": "Hi everyone and thank you so much for supporting our cause!  \nThis issue will not be going before the City Council this Thursday; the agenda item has been moved until June 14th.
