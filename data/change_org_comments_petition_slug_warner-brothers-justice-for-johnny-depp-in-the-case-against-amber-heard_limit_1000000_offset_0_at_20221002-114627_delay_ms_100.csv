""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.""
-Albert Einstein

We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as I  am a survivor of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, sadistic stalking, online harassment and defamation. 
Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.

The female betrayal of female victims is as old as the world. Because of this men worldwide call women dumb and inferior. The female betrayal includes bullying, slander, hate speech, psychoterror, abuse, violence, stalking, participation in FGM, child murder, abortion of female fetuses, femicide, forced marriages, childhood marriages, honor murder, dowry murder, sex murder, sexual torture, acid attacks, witch hunts, sex slavery, rape pornography, forced prostitution. Female treason also means excusing the perpetrators and accusing the victims. This is a worldwide disgrace and must have an end.
No wonder men around the world consider women for stupid and inferior. As long as women and girls behave so unsolidly and meanly, that will remain so.
If you are female and think you are safe at home, at school or at work, my experiences will teach you a better one! Because I have experiences with sexual harassment at school, high school, work place (I must change my job three times and my rental apartment one time because of extreme sexual harassment, rape attempts and sexual bossing and sexual terror and I lost one job because I said no to my boss), street harassments, online stalking and three cases of sadistic stalking during  child hood by a strange male, high school time by a classmate and later during the rent-time and after of a psychopathic tenant connected with telephone terror, hacker attacks, burglary attempts, damages to property, nuisance to my whole environment, verbal abuse by males in the society by catcalling on the street, on the train and  in the family by my brother-in-law connected with defamation and family terror and witch hunts connected with identity thefts and sexual deepfakes on the internet by my ex-tenant and all his friends.

I would advise all women, girls, and female children to learn self-defense and martial arts instead of learning to be beautiful and docile. Because the day could come when it saves their lives.

Later I deterred all the aggressors by telling them I practiced on a Grapfruit in a self-defense course, how to squeeze out the eyes of male aggressors.
And about one of the most male hate crime; Stalking is not fun and play, it is a hideous and disgusting crime and sexually sadistic because almost all victims are female.

The unintelligible thing about the whole thing is, all Criminals, Mobbers and Stalkers had spectators, bystanders and helpers and people, which are looking away, also females. How can women and girls in this world be so stupid to be not on their own side?
I have therefore the opinion that the cowardly crimes stalking, bullying and rape are punished as hard as possible and that helpers, bystanders and spectators must be also severely punished.
Bullying and stalking, rape culture should not be more straightforward in the future. In cases where bullying and stalking leads to death or ends with rape, gang rape, sexual torture, murder and suicide, there should be high lifelong imprisonment for all parties, including helpers and spectators.

Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny/Kate Manne (Autor)
Misogyny is a hot topic, yet it's often misunderstood. What is misogyny, exactly? Who deserves to be called a misogynist? How does misogyny contrast with sexism, and why is it prone to persist - or increase - even when sexist gender roles are waning? This book is an exploration of misogyny in public life and politics by the moral philosopher and writer Kate Manne. It argues that misogyny should not be understood primarily in terms of the hatred or hostility some men feel toward all or most women. Rather, it's primarily about controlling, policing, punishing, and exiling the ""bad"" women who challenge male dominance. And it's compatible with rewarding ""the good ones,"" and singling out other women to serve as warnings to those who are out of order. It's also common for women to serve as scapegoats, be burned as witches, and treated as pariahs.
Manne examines recent and current events such as the Isla Vista killings by Elliot Rodger, the case of the convicted serial rapist Daniel Holtzclaw, who preyed on African-American women as a police officer in Oklahoma City, Rush Limbaugh's diatribe against Sandra Fluke, and the ""misogyny speech"" of Julia Gillard, then Prime Minister of Australia, which went viral on YouTube. The book shows how these events, among others, set the stage for the 2016 US presidential election. Not only was the misogyny leveled against Hillary Clinton predictable in both quantity and quality, Manne argues it was predictable that many people would be prepared to forgive and forget regarding Donald Trump's history of sexual assault and harassment. For this, Manne argues, is misogyny's oft-overlooked and equally pernicious underbelly: exonerating or showing ""himpathy"" for the comparatively privileged men who dominate, threaten, and silence women.

Gendertrolling: How Misogyny Went Viral/Karla Mantilla (Autor)
Gendertrolling arises out of the same misogyny that fuels other ""real life"" forms of harassment and abuse of women. This book explains this phenomenon, the way it can impact women's lives, and how it can be stopped.
 Combines the phenomenon of trolling and keen feminist insight to create a unique perspective on the treatment of women, male/female interaction, and online user interaction
 Demonstrates what online rape and death threats have in common with street harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace, domestic violence, and date rape, showing the serious, harmful nature of this practice
 Discusses what can be done to change laws and Internet policies to increase women's freedom of speech and safety online.

A Brief History of Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice (Brief Histories)/ Jack Holland (Autor)
In this compelling, powerful book, highly respected writer and commentator Jack Holland sets out to answer a daunting question: how do you explain the oppression and brutalization of half the world's population by the other half, throughout history?
The result takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through centuries, continents and civilizations as it looks at both historical and contemporary attitudes to women. Encompassing the Church, witch hunts, sexual theory, Nazism and pro-life campaigners, we arrive at today's developing world, where women are increasingly and disproportionately at risk because of radicalised religious belief, famine, war and disease. Well-informed and researched, highly readable and thought-provoking, this is no outmoded feminist polemic: it's a refreshingly straightforward investigation into an ancient, pervasive and enduring injustice. It deals with the fundamentals of human existence -- sex, love, violence -- that have shaped the lives of humans throughout history.
The answer? It's time to recognize that the treatment of women amounts to nothing less than an abuse of human rights on an unthinkable scale. A Brief History of Misogyny is an important and timely book that will make a long-lasting contribution to the efforts to improve those rights throughout the world.

Misogyny and Media in the Age of Trump (Communicating Gender)/
Maria B. Marron (Herausgeber)
This book explores misogyny across media ranging from political and editorial cartoons to news, sport, film, television, social media (especially Twitter), and journalistic organizations that address gender inequities.

Beyond Blurred Lines: Rape Culture in Popular Media/Nickie D Phillips (Autor)
Beyond Blurred Lines explores the ways that the concept of “rape culture” resonates in popular media. This book demonstrates that popular culture, mass media, and social media are prominent sites for understanding and responding to sexual violence.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Autor)
Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. And, as Gail Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. Proving that porn desensitizes and actually limits our sexual freedom, Dines argues its omnipresence is a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town/Jon Krakauer (Autor)
Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, home to a highly regarded state university whose beloved football team inspires a passionately loyal fan base. Between January 2008 and May 2012, hundreds of students reported sexual assaults to the local police. Few of the cases were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.
In these pages, acclaimed journalist Jon Krakauer investigates a spate of campus rapes that occurred in Missoula over a four-year period. Taking the town as a case study for a crime that is sadly prevalent throughout the nation, Krakauer documents the experiences of five victims: their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the skepticism directed at them by police, prosecutors, and the public; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them. These stories cut through abstract ideological debate about acquaintance rape to demonstrate that it does not happen because women are sending mixed signals or seeking attention. They are victims of a terrible crime, deserving of fairness from our justice system. Rigorously researched, rendered in incisive prose, Missoula stands as an essential call to action.

Fraternity Gang Rape: Sex, Brotherhood, and Privilege on Campus /Peggy Reeves Sanday (Autor)
This widely acclaimed and meticulously documented volume illustrates, in painstaking and disturbing detail, the nature of fraternity gang rape. Drawing on interviews with both victims and fraternity members, Peggy Reeves Sanday reconstructs daily life in the fraternity, highlighting the role played by pornography, male bonding, and degrading, often grotesque, initiation and hazing rituals.
In a substantial new introduction and afterword, Sanday updates the incidences of fraternity gang rape on college campuses today, highlighting such recent cases as that of Duke University and others in the headlines. Sanday also explores the nature of hazing at sororities on campus and how Greek life in general contributes to a culture which promotes the exploitation and sexual degradation of women on campus. More broadly, Sanday examines the nature of campus life today and the possibility of creating a rape-free campus culture.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Autor)
An award-winning journalist's intimate investigation of the true scope of domestic violence, revealing how the roots of America's most pressing social crises are buried in abuse that happens behind closed doors.
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don't know we're seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths-that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

See What You Made Me Do: Power, Control and Domestic Violence /Jess Hill (Autor)
""Women are abused or killed by their partners at astonishing rates- in Australia, almost 17 per cent of women over the age of fifteen - one in six - have been abused by an intimate partner. In this confronting and deeply researched account, journalist Jess Hill uncovers the ways in which abusers exert control in the darkest - and most intimate - ways imaginable. She asks- What do we know about perpetrators? Why is it so hard to leave? What does successful intervention look like? What emerges is not only a searing investigation of the violence so many women experience, but a dissection of how that violence can be enabled and reinforced by the judicial system we trust to protect us. Combining exhaustive research with riveting storytelling, See What You Made Me Do dismantles the flawed logic of victim-blaming and challenges everything you thought you knew about domestic and family violence.""--Publisher's description.

Stalkers and their Victims /Paul E. Mullen (Autor)
Stalking has moved from being a novel area for study to become a core area of concern for mental health professionals, lawyers and other members of the criminal justice system. It has emerged as a significant social problem which not only commands considerable public attention but is now, in many jurisdictions, a specific form of criminal offence. This new edition brings the reader completely up-to-date with the explosion in published research and clinical studies in the field, and covers new issues such as cyberstalking, stalking health professionals, stalking in the workplace, female stalkers, juvenile stalkers, stalking celebrities, evaluating risk in the stalking situation, as well as exploring changes to the legal status of the behaviour. Illustrated with case studies throughout, this is the definitive guide and reference for anyone with professional, academic or other interests in this complex behaviour.

Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online/ Bailey Poland (Autor)
Cybersexism is rampant and can exact an astonishingly high cost. In some cases, the final result is suicide.
Bullying, stalking, and trolling are just the beginning. Extreme examples such as GamerGate get publicized, but otherwise the online abuse of women is largely underreported. Haters combines a history of online sexism with suggestions for solutions.
Using current events and the latest available research into cybersexism, Bailey Poland questions the motivations behind cybersexist activities and explores methods to reduce footprints of Internet misogyny, drawing parallels between online and offline abuse. By exploring the cases of Alyssa Funke, Rehtaeh Parsons, Audrie Pott, Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu, and others, and her personal experiences with sexism, Poland develops a compelling method of combating sexism online.

Domestic Disturbances, Patriarchal Values/ Marianna Muravyeva (Herausgeber)
This book offers an in-depth analysis of several national case studies on family violence between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, using court records as their main source. It raises important questions for research on early modern Europe: the notion of absolute power; sovereignty and its applicability to familial power; the problem of violence and the possibility of its usage for conflict resolution both in public and private spaces; and the interconnection of gender and violence against women, reconsidered in the context of modern state formation as a public sphere and family building as a private sphere.
Contributors bring together detailed studies of domestic violence and spousal murder in Romania, England, and Russia, abduction and forced marriage in Poland, infanticide and violence against parents in Finland, and rape and violence against women in Germany. These case studies serve as the basis for a comparative analysis of forms, models, and patterns of violence within the family in the context of debates on political power, absolutism, and violence. They highlight changes towards unlimited violence by family patriarchs in European countries, in the context of the changing relationship between the state and its citizens. This book was originally published as a special issue of the Journal of the History of the Family.

Every Move You Make: Chilling True Stories of Stalkers And Their Victims
/ Victoria Heywood
From secretive online followers to jealous ex-lovers and obsessed admirers through to random strangers and crazed criminals, this unnerving book will provide an insight into the minds of stalkers, and reveal how their sinister actions affect their victims.
Victims and stalkers tell their stories – both in person and through court records.
Enlightening interviews with police, psychiatrists, doctors and support workers highlight the sometimes deadly but always distressing consequences.

Online Killers: Portraits of Murderers, Cannibals and Sex Predators Who Stalked the Web for Their Victims
/ Christopher Barry-Dee,
Steven Morris
, Christopher Berry-Dee
Take a cyber journey where the flicker of LCD screens illuminates unimaginable evil. It starts as a harmless online-date, but can quickly turn to kidnap, torture and death. More than just tales of sinister criminals, this collection of true horror stores destroys commonly held myths, like ""it's safe to meet someone after knowing them online for many months."" Predators actually gain additional satisfaction from stalking their victims over long periods of time!
Online Killers chronicles the stories of men, women and children whose internet adventures led them into disastrous circumstances, including:
•Naïve 15-year-old Christina Long, whose meeting with a much older man from a chat room led to her rape and murder
•Schoolteacher Jane Longhurst, the victim of an obsessive necrophiliac who abused her decomposing body for weeks
•Bernd-Jurgen Brandes, who was not only killed and eaten by a cannibal, but had the whole process immortalized on video
•Young and beautiful Anastasia Solovyonva, the would-be bride who was brutally murdered at the hands of her supposed fiancé.

Date Rape Drugs/Suellen May
Date rape drugs earn their name from the primary motivation for their use: to facilitate sexual assault against an unwitting victim. Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, and Rohypnol are the three main types of drugs referred to as date rape drugs, though alcohol is the most common drug used to facilitate date rape. Although each of these drugs differs in their effect on the body, they all act as sedatives, frequently causing unconsciousness and amnesia. Easily dissolved in liquids, a date rape drug placed in a victim's drink can be consumed unknowingly and render the victim unconscious. After the drugs wears off, amnesia about previous events increases the chances that the assailant is never caught. Date Rape Drugs alerts readers to the dangers these drugs pose, how to recognize and avoid them, and how to protect themselves against them.

Not for Sale: Feminists Resisting Prostitution and Pornography
/ Rebecca Whisnant (Editor),
Christine Stark (Editor)
Including the latest research on prostitution and pornography, this essay anthology shows how the sex industries harm those within them while undermining the possibilities for gender justice, human equality, and stable sexual relationships. From sex industries survivors to social activists and theorists such as Taylor Lee, Adriene Sere, and Kristen Anderberg, this volume assesses from a feminist perspective the racism, poverty, militarism, and corporate capitalism of selling sex through strip clubs, brothels, mail-order brides, and child pornography.

Child Pornography/Tim Tate
An in-depth investigation into the nature, extent, production and distribution of child pornography, which is the evidence recorded in magazines, film or videotape of child molestation. It ranges from apparently innocent nude photographs to depictions of serious sexual assaults and sadistic torture. The author contends that those who buy child pornography are paedophiles. Without paedophilia there would be no child pornography, but without child pornography the myriad networks of active child abusers would collapse. Child pornography is the oil in the engine of paedophilia. The author also wrote ""What's Wrong With Your Rights?""

Mass Rape: The War against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina/ Alexandra Stiglmayer (Herausgeber), Roy Gutman (Künstler), Marion Faber (Übersetzer)
Alexandra Stiglmayer interviewed survivors of the continuing war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to reveal, to a seemingly deaf world, the horrors of the ongoing war in the former Yugoslavia. The womenprimarily of Muslim but also of Croatian and Serbian originhave endured the atrocities of rape and the loss of loved ones. Their testimony, published in the 1993 German edition, is bare, direct, and its cumulative effect overwhelming.
The first English edition contains Stiglmayer's updates to her own two essays, one detailing the historical context of the current conflict and the other presenting the core of the book, interviews with some twenty victims of rape as well as interviews with three Serbian perpetrators. Essays investi-gating mass rape and war from ethnopsychological, sociological, cultural, and medical perspectives are included.
New essays by Catharine A. MacKinnon, Rhonda Copelon, and Susan Brownmiller address the crucial issues of recognizing the human rights of women and children. A foreword by Roy Gutman describes war crimes within the context of the UN Tribunal, and an afterword by Cynthia Enloe relates the mass rapes of this war to developments and reactions in the international women's movement.
Accounts of torture, murder, mutilation, abduction, sexual enslavement, and systematic attempts to impregnateall in the name of ""ethnic cleansing""make for the grimmest of reading. However brutal and appalling the information conveyed here, this book cannot and should not be ignored.

Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment/ Linda Hirshman (Autor)
The first history—incisive, witty, fascinating—of the fight against sexual harassment, from the author of the New York Times bestseller Sisters in Law
Linda Hirshman, acclaimed historian of social movements, delivers the sweeping story of the struggle leading up to #MeToo and beyond: from the first tales of workplace harassment percolating to the surface in the 1970s, to the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal—when liberal women largely forgave Clinton, giving men a free pass for two decades. Many liberals even resisted the movement to end rape on campus.
And yet, legal, political, and cultural efforts, often spearheaded by women of color, were quietly paving the way for the takedown of abusers and harassers. Reckoning delivers the stirring tale of a movement catching fire as pioneering women in the media exposed the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, women flooded the political landscape, and the walls of male privilege finally began to crack. This is revelatory, essential social history.

The Accuser: The True Story of the Big Dan's Gang Rape Victim/ Karen Curtis (Author)
Cheryl Ann Araujo is The Accuser. In 1983, she was victimized by men, the judicial system, the Government, the media, and the Portuguese mob because she stood up against them all in the Big Dan's rape trial in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
In 1988, Jodie Foster portrayed a character loosely based on Cheryl Araujo in the Hollywood movie The Accused for which she won an Academy Award. Foster's character was gang raped on a pinball machine, rather than a pool table.
But, by the time the movie was released Cheryl was already dead. After the rape trials, she was run out of Massachusetts due to death threats and in 1986, died in a single-car accident in South Florida. Her two young daughters were with her in the car and survived. They recall what happened that fateful day in this book.
This is the true story about what the government and Hollywood do not want you to know regarding one young woman's fight as an accuser to tell her true story to a jury and to the world without being ""victim blamed."" Cheryl was one of the first accusers to face a camera in the courtroom shaping the way the media and judicial system covers rape trials today. Her grueling experience also planted the first seeds of today's burgeoning #MeToo movement.
The book contains never before published information, interviews, and photographs about the life and death of Cheryl Araujo, one of the most tragic accusers and heroines in American history.

Burned Alive: A Survivor of an ""Honor Killing"" Speaks Out/Souad (Author) Marie-Therese Cuny (Collaborator)
When Souad was seventeen she fell in love. In her West Bank village, as in so many others, sex before marriage is considered a grave dishonor to one's family and is punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of meting out her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family's clothes, he poured gasoline over her and set her on fire. Miraculously, she survived, rescued by women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horribly burned over seventy percent of her body and still denounced by her family, Souad was able to receive the care she needed only after the intervention of a European aid worker. Now in permanent exile from her homeland, she has decided to tell her story and reveal the barbarity of a practice that continues to this day. Burned Alive ...is the first true account ever published by a victim of an ""honor crime."" Souad's inspiring testimony is a shocking, moving, and harrowing story of cruelty and incomparable courage...and an inspiring call to action to end a heinous tradition.

Lynchings of Women in the United States: The Recorded Cases, 1851-1946/Kerry Segrave (Autor)
Between 1850 and 1950, at least 115 women were lynched by mobs in the United States. The majority of these women were black. This book examines the phenomenon of the lynching of women, a much more rare occurence than the lynching of men. Over the same hundred year period covered in this text, more than 1,000 white men were lynched, while thousands of black men were murdered by mobs. Of particular importance in this examination is the role of race in lynching, particularly the increase in the number of lynchings of black women as the century progressed. Details are provided--when available--in an attempt to shine a light on this form of deadly mob violence.

Stop Telling Women to Smile: Stories of Street Harassment and How We're Taking Back Our Power/Tatyana Fazlalizadeh (Autor)
Every day, all over the world, women are catcalled and denigrated simply for walking down the street. Boys will be boys, women have been told for generations, ignore it, shrug it off, take it as a compliment. But the harassment has real consequences for women: in the fear it instills and the shame they are made to feel.
In Stop Telling Women to Smile, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh uses her arresting street art portraits to explore how women experience hostility in communities that are supposed to be homes. She addresses the pervasiveness of street harassment, its effects, and the kinds of activism that can serve to counter it. The result is a cathartic reckoning with the aggression women endure, and an examination of what equality truly entails. 

The Stoning of Soraya M.: A Story of Injustice in Iran/Freidoune Sahebjam (Autor)
Soraya M.’s husband, Ghorban-Ali, couldn’t afford to marry another woman. Rather than returning Soraya’s dowry, as custom required before taking a second wife, he plotted with four friends and a counterfeit mullah to dispose of her. Together, they accused Soraya of adultery. Her only crime was cooking for a friend’s widowed husband. Exhausted by a lifetime of abuse and hardship, Soraya said nothing, and the makeshift tribunal took her silence as a confession of guilt. They sentenced her to death by stoning: a punishment prohibited by Islam but widely practiced.
Day by day—sometimes minute by minute—Sahebjam deftly recounts these horrendous events, tracing Soraya’s life with searing immediacy, from her arranged marriage and the births of her children to her husband’s increasing cruelty and her horrifying execution, where, by tradition, her father, husband, and sons hurled the first stones. A stark look at the intersection between culture and justice, this is one woman’s story, but it stands for the stories of thousands of women who suffered—and continue to suffer—the same fate. It is a story that must be told.

Women In Afghanistan: The Horrors of The Girl Child and Women In Afghanistan Under The Taliban / Robert M. Scott (Autor) 
WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN
The recent transfer of power from the former Afghan government has caused immense uncertainty across Afghanistan.
Even before the latest escalation in violence, half the population required humanitarian assistance. Forty years of war, chronic poverty, climate change-driven natural disasters, and now COVID-19 are a deadly combination for people in Afghanistan. Fifty percent of those in need in Afghanistan are women and girls.
As Kabul airport remains the epicenter of global attention in Afghanistan, world leaders must not forget the urgent needs of Afghan women and girls. The world cannot afford to turn its back. Here’s a look at what women and girls in Afghanistan need right now and what can be done to help.
Women and children are increasingly bearing the brunt of the violence and make up around half of all civilian casualties. They continue to be at risk of targeted attacks. Afghanistan has been the deadliest place for children for the past six years.
Women in Afghanistan face rising levels of domestic violence, abuse and exploitation.
“We know that during times of crisis, violence against women and girls increases,"" says Elinor Raikes, IRC vice president and head of program delivery. ""With uncertainty mounting throughout Afghanistan, the IRC is concerned that we could an increase in violence against women as well as an increase in child marriage.""
World leaders must fill the wide gap in aid funding so that women and children can receive protection and meet their essential needs.
As of August 2021, the international humanitarian response plan for Afghanistan is only 38 percent funded. That shortfall could mean that 1.2 million children will lose specialized protection services, making them more vulnerable to violence, recruitment, child labor, early and forced marriages, and sexual exploitation. And 1.4 million women—many of them survivors of violence—will be left without safe places to receive comprehensive support.
Since seizing Afghanistan, Taliban representatives and high officials have vowed to regard ladies' privileges to work and education, yet within an Islamic system they refuse to define.
These vows have provoked an international discussion about how much the Taliban have changed since they ruled the country with outrageous and severe misogyny in the 1990s, barring ladies from almost all work and education.
There have been calls from abroad to give the group time to shape a government and spread out its arrangement prior to pressing too hard on ladies' privileges. But there is increasing evidence from across Afghanistan that the biggest changes might be in messaging, rather than philosophy.",0,0,Event,25700041,0,comment,2021-09-20T08:35:07Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],25700041,25700041,"Justice For Johnny Depp, In The Case Against Amber Heard",2020-11-06T18:08:50Z,,2020-11-06T18:09:35Z,2020-11-07T00:01:30Z,en-US,['en'],"Warner Brothers: Justice For Johnny Depp, In The Case Against Amber Heard","<p>I made this petition because Johnny Depp needs justice.

There was more than <em><strong>sufficient evidence </strong></em>against Amber Heard, but the court ruled in her favor instead.</p>
<p>Because of this ruling, Mr. Depp has lost roles in movies and has <strong>critical</strong> defamation to his career. I would like to get enough signatures, and enough support from people to <em><strong>1.) Show Mr. Depp and the UK High Court that some serious re-evaluation need to be done regarding the case</strong></em> and; <em><strong>2.) Give Mr. Depp the career that he loved, and loves back to him.</strong></em> </p>
<p>I feel it is necessary for all parties to understand women are not the only people that can be abused. The evidence showed that Mr. Depp was <em><strong>in fact</strong></em>, abused and even had to go to the hospital because of his injuries. I want this petition to also be able to stop the stigma on abuse and violence; as a person whom also was abused by a female role model in my life.</p>
