<p><strong>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others. In which it's the most commonly recognised personality disorder. </strong></p>
<p>For an <strong>example</strong>, someone with a <strong>personality disorder </strong>will differ significantly from an average person in terms of how he/she thinks, feels, perceives and relates to others. </p>
<p>BPD comes in many shapes and sizes, i've listed a few below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>you feel worried about people abandoning you</strong>, and would do anything to stop that from happening. </li>
<li><strong>you get very intense emotions that can last up to a few hours to a few days and can change quickly</strong> (for an example, from feeling very happy and confident to suddenly feeling low and sad).</li>
<li><strong>you often question who you are</strong> and it can change significantly depending on who you're with. </li>
<li><strong>you find it hard to hold a stable relationships</strong>.</li>
<li>you <strong>feel lost, numb, empty and alone</strong> a lot of the times.</li>
<li>you act <strong>impulsively</strong> and do things that cause <strong>harm </strong>to you (such as <strong>binge eating, using illegal drugs or driving dangerously</strong>).</li>
<li>you often <strong>self harm</strong> or have suicidal <strong>feelings</strong>.</li>
<li>you have very intense feelings or <strong>anger</strong>, which are really difficult to control.</li>
<li>when you're very stressed, you may also experience <strong>paranoia</strong> or <strong>dissociation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BPD</strong> can be a serious condition, and many people with the condition <strong>self harm</strong> and attempt <strong>suicide</strong>. </p>
<p>people outside of the condition think <strong>BPD</strong> is having <strong>multiple personalities</strong>, they see people with <strong>BPD </strong>as someone that's abusive or dangerous when really deep down we're not, we're just misunderstood. I know some of the most kind, loving and thoughtful who have<strong> BPD</strong>, and i know they wouldn't hurt a fly. If i can give a secret of mine as someone who is diagnosed with <strong>BPD</strong> and i can pretty much say other people with <strong>BPD</strong> can agree with me on this, we <strong>hurt ourselves</strong> and we would rather hurt ourselves t<strong>han hurt anyone around us</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BPD isn't just a word</strong>, it is <strong>unhealed trauma</strong> and <strong>unhealed trauma responses</strong>. It's having the <strong>constant fear that people are going to abandon you</strong>, and it's having<strong> very intense emotions</strong>, it's regularly <strong>questioning who you are</strong>, it's having <strong>trouble maintaining relationships, it's feeling empty and numb ALL THE TIME</strong>, it's feeling <strong>angry</strong> and <strong>irritable</strong> and <strong>not knowing why or how to stop those emotions</strong>. It's having <strong>severe dissociation and paranoia</strong>, it's <strong>having daily impulses and having self destructive behaviour</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you know <strong>BPD</strong> is named <strong>one of the hardest illnesses to live with</strong>? and although our symptoms may become <strong>manageable over time</strong>, there's <strong>no actual cure</strong>. 1.2% of people who have been diagnosed with <strong>BPD</strong>, and 1 in 10 people who <strong>attempt suicide succeed</strong>. 80% of people with <strong>BPD</strong> will <strong>attempt suicide at least once in their life</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>I was 1 in 10 of the population who attempted suicide</strong>, and unfortunately <strong>i was put into a medically induced coma where i remained for three weeks</strong>, and although i wanted to end my life those are three weeks i will <strong>NEVER</strong> get back and turn round and make it right. </p>
<p>What i'm trying to say is, <strong>we need more people to understand how hard this fight is alone, never mind having people make it 10x worse for us. We're the most outgoing, kind and loving people, we can't help being happy one minute and the next we're on the floor hysterically crying wanting to end our life. We don't want to end our life, we want to end the pain and suffering. We're not selfish, we're not rude we're trying</strong>. </p>
<p>My point of this petition is to <strong>end stigma against people who have BPD</strong> because I've received hate, and in the words of this troll was <strong>""your daughter should change her name to Amber""</strong> <strong>JUST BECAUSE I HAVE BPD!!!</strong> and i just find that so rude and disrespectful! just because <strong>Amber Heard was diagnosed with BPD</strong> and since showing this comment I've had made towards me, <strong>loads of other people who have BPD have been told the same things</strong>. And if I'm entirely honest it's absolutely disgusting. <strong>No one should ever receive hate because of a disorder they have and can't change</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Having BPD doesn't make us anything like Amber Heard and we should't have to feel like we are because we are NOTHING like her and we NEVER will! We as a community DO NOT CLAIM HER! AND WE ARE OUR OWN INDIVIDUALS!! </strong></p>

<li><strong>you feel worried about people abandoning you</strong>, and would do anything to stop that from happening. </li>
<li><strong>you get very intense emotions that can last up to a few hours to a few days and can change quickly</strong> (for an example, from feeling very happy and confident to suddenly feeling low and sad).</li>
<li><strong>you often question who you are</strong> and it can change significantly depending on who you're with. </li>
<li><strong>you find it hard to hold a stable relationships</strong>.</li>
<li>you <strong>feel lost, numb, empty and alone</strong> a lot of the times.</li>
<li>you act <strong>impulsively</strong> and do things that cause <strong>harm </strong>to you (such as <strong>binge eating, using illegal drugs or driving dangerously</strong>).</li>
<li>you often <strong>self harm</strong> or have suicidal <strong>feelings</strong>.</li>
<li>you have very intense feelings or <strong>anger</strong>, which are really difficult to control.</li>
<li>when you're very stressed, you may also experience <strong>paranoia</strong> or <strong>dissociation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BPD</strong> can be a serious condition, and many people with the condition <strong>self harm</strong> and attempt <strong>suicide</strong>. </p>
<p>people outside of the condition think <strong>BPD</strong> is having <strong>multiple personalities</strong>, they see people with <strong>BPD </strong>as someone that's abusive or dangerous when really deep down we're not, we're just misunderstood. I know some of the most kind, loving and thoughtful who have<strong> BPD</strong>, and i know they wouldn't hurt a fly. If i can give a secret of mine as someone who is diagnosed with <strong>BPD</strong> and i can pretty much say other people with <strong>BPD</strong> can agree with me on this, we <strong>hurt ourselves</strong> and we would rather hurt ourselves t<strong>han hurt anyone around us</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BPD isn't just a word</strong>, it is <strong>unhealed trauma</strong> and <strong>unhealed trauma responses</strong>. It's having the <strong>constant fear that people are going to abandon you</strong>, and it's having<strong> very intense emotions</strong>, it's regularly <strong>questioning who you are</strong>, it's having <strong>trouble maintaining relationships, it's feeling empty and numb ALL THE TIME</strong>, it's feeling <strong>angry</strong> and <strong>irritable</strong> and <strong>not knowing why or how to stop those emotions</strong>. It's having <strong>severe dissociation and paranoia</strong>, it's <strong>having daily impulses and having self destructive behaviour</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you know <strong>BPD</strong> is named <strong>one of the hardest illnesses to live with</strong>? and although our symptoms may become <strong>manageable over time</strong>, there's <strong>no actual cure</strong>. 1.2% of people who have been diagnosed with <strong>BPD</strong>, and 1 in 10 people who <strong>attempt suicide succeed</strong>. 80% of people with <strong>BPD</strong> will <strong>attempt suicide at least once in their life</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>I was 1 in 10 of the population who attempted suicide</strong>, and unfortunately <strong>i was put into a medically induced coma where i remained for three weeks</strong>, and although i wanted to end my life those are three weeks i will <strong>NEVER</strong> get back and turn round and make it right. </p>
<p>What i'm trying to say is, <strong>we need more people to understand how hard this fight is alone, never mind having people make it 10x worse for us. We're the most outgoing, kind and loving people, we can't help being happy one minute and the next we're on the floor hysterically crying wanting to end our life. We don't want to end our life, we want to end the pain and suffering. We're not selfish, we're not rude we're trying</strong>. </p>
<p>My point of this petition is to <strong>end stigma against people who have BPD</strong> because I've received hate, and in the words of this troll was <strong>""your daughter should change her name to Amber""</strong> <strong>JUST BECAUSE I HAVE BPD!!!</strong> and i just find that so rude and disrespectful! just because <strong>Amber Heard was diagnosed with BPD</strong> and since showing this comment I've had made towards me, <strong>loads of other people who have BPD have been told the same things</strong>. And if I'm entirely honest it's absolutely disgusting. <strong>No one should ever receive hate because of a disorder they have and can't change</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Having BPD doesn't make us anything like Amber Heard and we should't have to feel like we are because we are NOTHING like her and we NEVER will! We as a community DO NOT CLAIM HER! AND WE ARE OUR OWN INDIVIDUALS!! </strong></p>

<p><strong>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others. In which it's the most commonly recognised personality disorder. </strong></p>
