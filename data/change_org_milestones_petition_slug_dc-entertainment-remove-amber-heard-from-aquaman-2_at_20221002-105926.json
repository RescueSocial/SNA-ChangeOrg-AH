They had been backing away from her after her divorce from Johnny Depp because they were favoring Depp at the time. But when Heard sicced her allegations of domestic violence on him, the tables turned against Depp.</p>\n<p>Now, however, the tides have turned again, in favor of Depp. Many in the industry are shocked at the information that\u2019s been released about her destructive, abusive behavior. They already knew that she slept her way to the top, something she\u2019d been doing since her modeling days, and even knew about her reported wild orgies. But they had no idea the depths of her depravity.</p>\n<p>Insiders believe that we\u2019ve seen the last of Amber Heard in any major Hollywood projects. Well, just about any Hollywood projects, for that matter. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Johnny Depp\u2019s Dance card is pretty full. He\u2019s currently starring in Ma\u00efwenn's 'Jeanne Du Barry', Filming Underway In France. \u00a0And he\u2019s set to direct the upcoming film Modigliani. And according to IMDB, Depp is slated to produce no fewer than 22 upcoming projects. He\u2019s also still recording and touring with his band, The Hollywood Vampires.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what winning looks like.</p>\n<p>It appears that Depp has moved on from his ordeal, is happy and healthy, and living his best life.

En masse, as if orchestrated to do so, Amber Heard supporters have begun to bombard Paul Bettany with abusive messages stemming from a conversation he had with Johnny Depp while Johnny was still in an abusive relationship with his how ex-wife Amber Heard.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not aware of this conversation, Johnny Depp vented his frustrations about his abusive (ex) wife to his dear friend Paul Bettany, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s burn Amber!!!\u201d</p>\n<p>To which Bettany responded: \u201cHaving thought it through I don\u2019t think we should burn Amber \u2013 she\u2019s delightful company and easy on the eye, plus I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s a witch. We could of course try the English course of action in these predicaments \u00ad\u2013 we do a drowning test. Thoughts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Depp responded: \u201cLet\u2019s drown her before we burn her!!! I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not pretty, but we have to keep in mind that Johnny had been abused by Heard for years, including incidents during which Heard threw a bottle at Johnny Depp, cutting his finger off, punching him in the head, kicking a door into his head and putting a cigarette out on Johnny Depp\u2019s face. It\u2019s not uncommon for victims to vent against their abusers to friends or family. Besides which, what isn\u2019t often mentioned about these texts is the last one that Johnny sent, which said:</p>\n<p>\u201cI am admittedly too f-cked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love\u2026 for little reason, as well as I\u2019m too old to be that guy. But pills are fine!!!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right. After everything she had done to him, he still loved her. It wasn\u2019t until some time later that he realized that she didn\u2019t love him anymore, if she ever loved him at all. At that point, his heart still didn\u2019t want to give up on her.</p>\n<p>Point being, that\u2019s the text exchange that Heard fans are up in arms about, Johnny Depp venting to his friend about being abused. These people seem to conveniently ignore the abuse that Johnny\u2019s venting about. Texts sent in private that were never meant to be seen are being hailed as Johnny Depp being \u201cabusive\u201d but the mountain of evidence proving that Heard was actually the abuser is swept off to the side, ignored.</p>\n<p>No, Heard\u2019s fans insist, the fact that the text exist at all is proof that Johnny is the abuser. Clearly, they say, the texts are threatening toward Heard and he must be held legally liable for them.</p>\n<p>The court disagrees. In response to Heard\u2019s counterclaim, the texts are irrelevant and inadmissible saying that: The remaining two allegations of computer usage fail under the third prong of the VCCA because Ms. Heard has not alleged that they were made with the intent to \u2018coerce, intimidate, or harass.\u2019 See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Rather, it appears that Mr. Depp texted those statements privately, to two of his friends, and Ms. Heard has not alleged that Mr. Depp intended for her to see them. Accordingly, this Court sustains the Demurrer to Count III since none of Ms. Heard\u2019s allegations satisfy the prongs of the VCCA.\u201d</p>\n<p>She TRIED to say that those texts were a threat, coercion, or intimidation toward her in some way, but the court slapped it down.</p>\n<p>Still doesn\u2019t stop her supporters from using them, though. They\u2019re inundating Bettany with a litany of Tweets today, saying things like: \u201cBelieve me</p>\n<p>@Paul_Bettany, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoraMelodie/status/1474801755074539529\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this was waaay less unpleasant</a> than Amber Heard finding out that her abusive ex-husband Johnny Depp and his druggie buddy were joking about killing and raping her Sorry but, I'm having a hard time shedding a single tear for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Depp supporters are stepping up, though, defending Bettany, saying: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FMGiveMeTruth/status/1474818032195313667\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cthese texts were never sent to amber heard</a>, it was dark tasteless humor between friends and they don't change the fact that amber heard is a lying, abusing sociopath who steals millions from dying children.\u201d A reference to the fact that Heard has claimed many times, on television interviews that she donated 3.5 million of her divorce settlement to a children\u2019s hospital, when in fact she never did.<br>And:<br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/roaringrapids22/status/1475165213557207048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conveniently,</a> the media never mention the text exchange between Johnny Depp &amp; Paul Bettany is taken from a Monty Python sketch, nor do they usually publish the end of the text, where Mr. Depp says, \"I could never do this to someone I love.\"</p>\n<p>If you ask me, Heard\u2019s supporters ganging up on Bettany is no better than what they\u2019re accusing Johnny Depp of. Johnny Depp\u2019s texts were private and understandable, while they\u2019re attacking a friend of his publicly and without provocation. And they\u2019re doing it at Christmas. Bettany is a family man, making this an especially devious time to harass him.</p>\n<p>But, as appalling as this behavior is, it is not surprising. April 2022 is rapidly approaching, and Heard will have to face the music in Depp\u2019s $50 million defamation suit. I suspect that the closer that date gets, the more devious antics we\u2019ll see from Heard\u2019s camp. If they weren\u2019t so cruel, they\u2019d be comical in their predictability.

So let\u2019s take a deeper look at the auction. They should be clearer in the headline.</p>\n<p>What you can expect to bid:<br>Right now, there\u2019s only one bid, even though the auction has been posted for days. And that bid is for $1,050, by someone called \u2018Unsparing Bidder.\u2019 Weird, but whatever.<br><br>The next minimum bid you can make is $1,300.<br><br>So, if you really have a burning desire to talk to Amber Heard, you can expect to spend thousands. According to the auction page, this package is worth $5,000.<br><br>And here\u2019s what you get:<br>\u201cJoin Amber Heard for a Zoom Call to discuss\u00a0Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\u00a0and receive an autographed comic book signed by the cast of the upcoming\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0sequel!<br><br>The comic book signatures include Amber Heard, Randall Park, Patrick Wilson, Jason Momoa, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Dolph Lundgren, and Director James Wan.\u201d<br>So the comic IS signed by most of the cast. Good to know.</p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019re an Amber Heard fan, it looks great, right? Well, wait. There are a few caveats.</p>\n<p>The Zoom meet and greet will only last 10 minutes. <br>So plan your chat accordingly. Have those questions planned out, because you\u2019re not going to have her all day. You\u2019re not even going to have her for an hour.<br><br>Experience expires on Dec 17, 2022. <br>So get it in while you can.<br><br>Experience blackout dates: Holidays. <br>So be sure there aren\u2019t any holidays taking place when you schedule your chat. That might keep you from getting your prize.<br>And further:</p>\n<p>The auction is valid for 1 person. <br>So it looks like your spouse, bestie, whoever, can\u2019t sit beside you and chat along. Just you.<br><br>Participant must be at least 18.<br><br>This is a private virtual meet and greet via Zoom. <br>I\u2019m sure glad they cleared that up, since they said in the headline that the meet and greet is via Zoom.<br><br>Approximate duration: 10 minutes. <br>APPROXIMATE duration? That means that your chat could be cut short. Instead of 10 minutes, you could get 2, and since the word APPROXIMATE is right here in the rules, you won\u2019t be able to complain or get your money back.<br><br>Photos are not allowed. <br>Wait. If I get to talk to Amber Heard, I can\u2019t take any pictures? Well, that\u2019s a rip. I\u2019d REALLY like to get a snap of her face when she realizes it\u2019s me she\u2019s talking to.<br><br>Sharing of login information is forbidden and can result in cancellation of the experience. <br>This looks like a convenient way for you to get stiffed If they even THINK you shared their login information, they can cancel your experience.<br><br>Recording, screen grabs, or distribution of the session is strictly prohibited unless otherwise approved by the donor. <br>So, no snaps, grabs, or recording of any kind unless Amber Heard says it\u2019s okay? What do you think the odds are of that?<br><br>Zoom will be scheduled based on Ms. Heard's availability and potential alignment of time zones. <br>This all kinds of slippery. The chat will be scheduled according to Ms. Heard\u2019s availability? So all she has to do is say she\u2019s busy and you could be out thousands of dollars and have nothing to show for it.<br><br>Description of the merchandise is as follows:<br>The item is new. <br>Well, one would certainly hope so.<br><br>Does not include a certificate of authenticity. <br>For collectors, not having a certificate of authenticity might be a deal breaker, since you can\u2019t prove that the comic and signatures are authentic.<br><br>The rules and regulations state that the prize:<br>In condition as donated. <br>Wait. Didn\u2019t they say a minute ago that the prize is new? What\u2019s up with that? Or do they mean the condition Ms. Heard is in? Given her reported chemical proclivities, that could turn out to be one hilarious chat. Too bad you can\u2019t record it.<br><br>Cannot be returned or exchanged. <br>So, no matter what happens, you\u2019re stuck paying thousands of dollars with no guarantee of what you\u2019ll get. That\u2019s something to think about.<br><br>Experience cannot be resold or re-auctioned. <br>So you\u2019re stuck with it. Remember that.<br><br>Cannot be transferred. <br>So even if you think someone else is more deserving, you can\u2019t let them have it. Kind of a shame.<br><br>Blackout dates may apply. <br>Again, slippery. WHAT blackout dates, and who gets to decide? This is yet another red flag that you could end up paying thousands of dollars only to get stiffed.<br><br>Additional shipping charges may apply based upon the location of the winner.<br>We expect all winning bidders and their guests to conduct themselves appropriately when attending an experience won at Charitybuzz. Polite manners and respect for the generous donor and adherence to any rules or parameters are a must.<br><br>What behavioral guidelines does SHE have to follow, eh? Sounds like they can cut your experience short if they even think you\u2019re looking at her the wrong way. Another way for you to not get what you paid for.<br><br>To be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon date, based on the donor's availability. <br>They already said that part. Why the need to double down on it?<br><br>So there you have it. That\u2019s the great prize for paying upwards of $5,000 or more. A (maybe) 10 minute chat with Amber Heard, IF she decides she\u2019s available for it, you have to kiss her butt, and you\u2019re not allowed to record it or take screen grabs.</p>\n<p>And, did I mention that at the time of this writing, there\u2019s exactly ONE bid?

Not exactly. While it's true that her filming time seems to have been severely limited compared to the rest of the cast, and the fact that the film has moved filming locations from London to Hawaii, while Heard didn't relocate with the rest of the production. It looks like it's possible that Heard's role may be MUCH smaller than she'd have us believe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time will have to tell whether that's true or not.</p>\n<p>But I do have to set the record straight.

Not on Change.org, and not on Google.

We average about 100 new signatures a day. That's not going to break any records, but it's slow and steady progress. It's proof that there are still more and more people out there that do not want to see Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. They don't want to see her in anything, honestly, but this petition only pertains to Aquaman 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, sadly, we cannot confirm that she's been removed. Her role might have been reduced, maybe even filmed in such a way that she can be edited out and replaced, depending on how Johnny Depp's 50 million dollar defamation suit against her goes.

The op-ed didn\u2019t name Depp, but followed months of Heard\u2019s allegations that he had abused her.</p>\n<p>Depp lost his role in Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise four days after the op-ed came out. Depp is asking for $50 million in damages.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, Heard has filed a counterclaim against Depp asking for $100 million, alleging that Depp orchestrated a smear campaign against her \u2013 including allegations that Depp is/was responsible for this petition's creation.

You may not have heard it before, or there might have been new evidence that\u2019s got you ready for another listen. It\u2019s the truth, and it\u2019s out there.

That I\u2019d be kicked out. I\u2019d be evicted. So Rock and Josh and everybody, evicted in 21 days.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Johnny answered that fear, telling Amber that she\u2019d have however long she needed to get her feet back up underneath her. \u201cBut I told you the last time we talked, told you that you were fine, that you stay there two, three, fucking four months, whatever.

They told me 21 days. THAT IS PART OF WHY I ACCUSED YOU OF DOING THAT.\u201d</p>\n<p>There you have it. In her own words, from her own mouth. Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of abusing her so that she and her friends could stay in the penthouses at the Eastern Columbia Building. Not because he actually abused her. Not because she was afraid of him. Because she didn\u2019t want to lose the apartment. Never mind that she had her own place, her dad\u2019s place, friends\u2019 places and countless other places she could have landed, she insists that she would have been homeless if she had to leave the ECB, so she had no choice but to lie about Johnny Depp and accuse him of domestic abuse.</p>\n<p>Oh, please.</p>\n<p>If this doesn\u2019t convince you that she\u2019s full of it, I don\u2019t know what else to tell you.

Anybody else would have been fired. Period. Yet here\u2019s Amber Heard, acting like she\u2019s bulletproof, with support from inside the industry.</p>\n<p>What a travesty.</p>\n<p>But what\u2019s funny is that Safran neglects to mention the petition to remove Amber Heard from AM2 petition, which carries almost 2 million signatures from consumers who promise to boycott the movie if she\u2019s in it. And, despite efforts to silence the petition, more and more people sign it every day.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the apparent inclusion of Heard in AM2 has re-ignited\u00a0the #JusticeForJohnnyDepp crew on Twitter again. There\u2019s a whole world of people out here that don\u2019t want to see Amber Heard in AM2, and it\u2019s not just rabid Johnny Depp fans, as the slanted media would have you believe. A great many people opposing Amber Heard are survivors of domestic abuse who are outraged that Johnny Depp, the victim of domestic abuse, is still being treated like a pariah while his abuser continues to work in films.</p>\n<p>In fact, a great many of them really didn\u2019t care for Johnny Depp one way or another, but were outraged that there\u2019s such a biased double standard when it comes to male victims of domestic abuse, and that Depp continues to face false allegations of domestic abuse when he is, in fact, the victim.</p>\n<p>Like the front page of this petition says, men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>At this time, it appears that Amber Heard is, indeed, involved with AM2. But we don\u2019t know in what capacity, or to what extent. She could be the costar from start to finish, or she could be cast in just a few scenes that could easily be reshot after some judicial decisions are made about her. After all, Johnny Depp was removed from FB3 after filming already started. The same thing could happen to Heard after court happens.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s not forget, after all, that she\u2019s not just facing Johnny Depp in court for Defamation. She\u2019s also being investigated by the FBI, and it Australia for perjury.</p>\n<p>Her legal woes aren\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d civil. They\u2019re also criminal.</p>\n<p>So she and her cohorts can pooh-pooh the internet and the millions of people out here in the real world that are rallying against her, but her world might not be all roses and sunshine like she makes it out to be. There could be serious legal and financial ramifications that she\u2019ll have to face, not the least of which is a massive flop when those millions of people boycott AM2.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll have to wait and see what becomes of AM2, Heard\u2019s legal issues, and her career. But I, for one, don\u2019t see a thriving future for her in Hollywood moving forward. She got the AM franchise when she was married to Johnny Depp, sure. But her dance card isn\u2019t looking too good otherwise. There are no new projects listed for her on her IMDB page, and the rumor mill isn\u2019t churning out anything of merit.</p>\n<p>Heard might be mugging for selfies now, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll be laughing out the other side of her face when the dust settles.</p>\n<p>Time will tell.</p>\n<p>What do you think?

And we\u2019ll have to wait and see which of the two really is ready to put the issue to bed and move on, whichever way it comes out.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Heard insists that she\u2019s involved in Aquaman 2, while Depp and his production company, Infinitum Nihil, have dozens of projects in the works.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/859501-johnny-depps-popularity-continues-to-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOURCE</a></p>", "photo": {"id": "225732991", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/3/eo/wi/kBeOWIPPlzTsKbE-800x450-noPad.jpg?1625590022", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "29288233", "createdAt": "2021-07-03T15:22:51.000Z", "title": "Baby Backlash", "description": "<p>Two days ago, Amber Heard announced that she has become the mother of a daughter named Oonagh Paige Heard via surrogate. In her announcement, months after the baby\u2019s birth, Heard said: that baby Oonagh is \u2018the beginning of the rest of my life\u2019. And the backlash was immediate.</p>\n<p>Now, there\u2019s an article titled: Becoming a mother isn\u2019t all about you, Amber Heard. In it, author Amanda Platell calls Heard to task, saying:</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, what? How about the beginning of someone else\u2019s life? Having a child, Amber, is not about you. It\u2019s about the tiny, helpless person you have chosen to bring into the world. Becoming a mother is the most selfless thing a woman can do. Forgive me if I have my lingering doubts that Amber understands that.\u201d</p>\n<p>And many Twitter denizens tend to agree. \u201cHer post was compete all about her,\u201d writes one sceptic. \u201cShe can\u2019t hide her narcissism.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, me, me Heard,\u201d says another.</p>\n<p>One Twitter denizen is quick to point out that although the baby was born in April, Heard still hasn\u2019t updated her twitter bio. As of this writing, Heard\u2019s bio says that she\u2019s a(n) \u201cActor and activist, semi-professional disruptor, ice cream advocate and shameless teacup Yorkie-lover.\u201d Not a word about being a devoted mommy to a sweet little angel.</p>\n<p>They get that Heard might have wanted some private time with baby Oonagh before making an announcement to the world, but she\u2019s let the cat out of the bag now, and still not a word in her Twitter bio about her overwhelming joy at welcoming her new bouncing bundle of joy.</p>\n<p>Likewise, there\u2019s no category for Heard being a mother on her Instagram account. Just the same tired old categories that have been up forever.</p>\n<p>One might argue that she\u2019s too busy to bother with such trivialities, but she hasn\u2019t been too busy to post pictures of herself, or to post the announcement itself.</p>\n<p>One might, then, wonder where Heard\u2019s priorities lie.</p>\n<p>The day Oonagh was born, Heard posted a video of herself crawling around on the beach in a flimsy sundress, babbling about death threats. One Twitter user was quick to say: \u201cSo much concern for her new baby and the woman who actually birthed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another posted the video from that day with the caption: \u201cThe day her baby was born. On the beach Not with her child or surrogate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, the majority of the comments on Twitter show concern for a baby being raised by someone with a history of and arrest for domestic violence, posting the hashtag: #SaveBabyHeard.</p>\n<p>While this concern is touching, Heard\u2019s history of violence is against adults. She has no public record of a history of violence against children. And, while having a newborn can be a stressful and trying time, it\u2019s almost certain that Heard has a network of nannies and family upon whom she can lean to do most of the heavy lifting. After all, Heard is in London, reportedly filming right now, and there\u2019s no evidence that the baby is with her. There have been lots of photos and videos of Heard out and about in London, but none of them show evidence that she\u2019s got the baby along for the ride. So somebody\u2019s looking after little Oonagh.</p>\n<p>So, not to worry. There are probably enough people in baby Oonagh\u2019s life to ensure that she\u2019ll grow up safe and happy. Let's all wish little Oonagh the very best that life has to offer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-9751153/PLATELLS-PEOPLE-mother-isnt-Amber-Heard.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOURCE</a></p>", "photo": {"id": "225724444", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/7/lh/os/eBlhOsNCFKvYpba-800x450-noPad.jpg?1625325774", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "29275299", "createdAt": "2021-06-30T15:22:47.000Z", "title": "Depp fans and abuse survivors livid", "description": "<p>Aquaman director James Wan recently released the title of Aquaman 2 and confirmed that filming has begun, and the backlash from #JusticeForJohnnyDepp fans was immediate.</p>\n<p>Depp fans and abuse survivors flooded both of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/creepypuppet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wan's Instagram</a> messages with so many calls for Amber Heard to be removed from Aquaman 2 that he had to restrict his comments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, one brave fan placed a \"Justice for Johnny Depp\" poster outside the Warner Bros studio outside London as a reminder that millions of people have sworn to boycott the film vehemently if and when it comes out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>People aren't soon to forget that Johnny Depp was removed from the Pirates franchise and fired from Fantastic Beasts while his abuser continues to work.

Nobody knows for sure, including possibly Heard herself. She hasn't shared any pre-production tidbits like she did when gearing up for the first one. No costume previews, no workout videos with studio professionals, hada. Her timelines are instead filled with old pictures of herself in precarious positions with questionable attire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even IF Warner Bros are still considering Heard for the film, there might be a huge monkey wrench set to be thrown into the works. Heard might lose her Visa to enter Australia, where the first one was filmed (and the second likely will be, too).</p>\n<p>Heard, you see, is currently under investigation by the Australian department of agriculture for circumstances surrounding the time when Heard smuggled two teacup Yorkies into the country.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe department is investigating if any criminal offences under Commonwealth legislation have been committed relating to the testimony provided to the High Court in London.

It just depends of the severity of the offence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Providing a false document on entry\u00a0to Australia\u00a0under the Migration Act is a serious offence that attracts a maximum\u00a0penalty\u00a0of 12 months jail and a\u00a0fine\u00a0of $10,200. Furthermore, Heard didn\u2019t just lie on her documents, she also lied to the judge and perjury\u00a0is a far more serious offence and the maximum\u00a0penalty\u00a0is 14 years in jail.</p>\n<p>She squeaked out of charges at the time, but those events are being investigated. So it's very possible that her application to travel to Australia will be denied, leaving Heard out in the cold for any filming that takes place there.</p>\n<p>Is Heard important enough to the film for them to arrange for alternate locations this late in the game?

And make no mistake, there's evidence we haven't even heard of yet. The Eastern Columbia building, where the couple lived, has CCtv security cameras that capture everything. There are stories about Heard chasing Depp out into the hall. If that happened, there's footage of it. Not to mention whatever men might have visited Heard in the penthouse when Depp was away working. Including what times they arrived and left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus, there's the incident where Heard accused Depp of spilling wine all up and down the hallway in a fit of rage. If that happened, it'll be on camera, too. If not, the unblinking eye of the camera will show the truth of what happened that night. Including who was where, and when. Did the other penthouse denizens pass Depp's security to get into PH3? If not, they had to have come in through the adjoining penthouse, which screams setup, and blatantly contradicts their testimony.</p>\n<p>Let's see those Toronto tapes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's hear more of those recorded conversations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's see it ALL.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, yes.

This information has struck a lot of Johnny Depp supporters hard, because it seems like she can get away with whatever she wants and keep getting roles in blockbuster films.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there's more to the story.</p>\n<p>For one thing, there are millions of people bombarding @WBPictures on Twitter with their disdain for this decision. Amber Heard seems to get away with being this massive abuser and doesn't get fired, while Johnny Depp, who is overwhelmingly innnocent, gets canned from two major franchises. The Travesty! These millions promise to #BoycottAquaman2 and there are whispers of demonstrations at both the filming locations and the movie's premiers in assorted countries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So things don't look so hot for WB for hiring Amber Heard back after reportedly buying out her contract so that she wouldn't be in it.</p>\n<p>Plus, there are still legal woes plaguing Amber Heard. And, no. I don't just mean the defamation case brought against her buy Johnny Depp, which is set to begin in April of 2022.</p>\n<p>Nope. I'm talking about Amber Heard reportedly being investigated by the Australian government for perjury in association with smuggling two dogs into Australia contrary to Oz's biosecurity laws.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's nothing new, I know. It's been going around for years that they're looking at her for that, seemingly with no end in sight.</p>\n<p>What's new is a claim by a Youbuter named <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=That+umbrella+guy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">That Umbrella Guy</a> that the FBI has been contacted to assist with the investigation. If that's true, it puts things in a whole different light. The penalty for perjury in Australia could land Heard as many as 14 years in jail, hefty fines, and possibly being banned from Australia for a number of years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While it's disturbingly unlikely that Heard will do any jail time (though many of her detractors hope she will), being banned from the country could affect filming schedules from any movie being produced there.</p>\n<p>Including Aquaman 2.</p>\n<p>It's been said by cast and crew that AM2 will begin filming in London in June, 2021, but that's likely for the indoor scenes. It's very possible that the outside scenes will be filmed in Australia, like they were for AM1.</p>\n<p>If that's the case, Heard would not be able to film in Australia. Granted, there may be legal loopholes they can jump through to make it possible, since the film is a preexisting project, or some such, but it presents an ever-growing headache for any studio that considers working with her in the future. Time will have to tell that tale.</p>\n<p>Regardless, whatever happens in court, and in Australia, Johnny Depp's popularity and productivity continue to soar, while Heard's public opinion seems to be waning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will Heard be able to repair her public image? A LOT of people, myself included, doubt it sincerely, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Is Heard washed up? Or will she rally?

She stated, \u201cThroughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since then, Johnny Depp has fought back against every bad word against him with libel and defamation lawsuits, so far against\u00a0The Sun\u00a0(which he lost), and against Amber Heard, which has not yet been seen in court. According to\u00a0Deadline, the latest update is that their court date is once again pushed back to at least April 11, 2022.\u00a0If Amber Heard loses, she could face jail\u00a0time for tampering with evidence.</p>\n<p>Even though it\u2019s possible Johnny Depp could win his upcoming lawsuit in the coming years, there\u2019s no confirming whether or not Amber Heard will face jail time. Regardless, this puts Warner Bros. in a tough spot. Even though fans had petitioned for Warner Bros. to force\u00a0Amber Heard\u2019s resignation from\u00a0Aquaman 2, WB hasn\u2019t announced any plans for change.</p>\n<p>However, in December 2020, a lifestyle article in\u00a0Forbes\u00a0about Emilia Clarke\u2019s home let the cat out of the bag that Emilia Clarke had signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in\u00a0Aquaman 2.\u00a0Sadly, though, there\u2019s still no confirmation. It could just be wishful thinking on the fans\u2019 part.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not clear according to that article why Amber Heard could be facing jail time if Johnny Depp wins his appeal. They mention tampering with evidence, but don\u2019t say clearly what evidence, or how it was tampered with.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and suggest that if Johnny wins his appeal, Heard might be on the hook for some very serious perjury charges. She\u2019s already being investigated in Australia for Perjury charges for falsifying statements about smuggling their dogs Pistol and Boo into the country. So it wouldn\u2019t be a far stretch if she\u2019s investigated in a London court for the same crime. Not for lying about the dogs, this time, though, but for potentially lying on the stand during Johnny\u2019s libel case against NGN and the Sun tabloid.</p>\n<p>It could be for something else altogether.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s not forget that there\u2019s no statute of limitations in Australia for grievous bodily injury requiring medical attention. And that\u2019s where Heard cut off the tip of Johnny\u2019s finger with a Vodka bottle. And, no. I\u2019m not making a wild accusation there. Heard herself was recorded on audiotape admitting that she did, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it!\u201d and begging Johnny not to leave her.</p>\n<p>The point being, if Johnny wanted to, he could always file a report with Australian police and have her put behind bars for a long time. And if her were the vengeful monster she keeps trying to say he is, he would have done that already.</p>\n<p>All Johnny\u2019s interested in is clearing his name. He\u2019s said it time and time again, and the fact that Heard\u2019s not cooling her heels already in an Australian prison proves it.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Will Heard face jail time if Johnny wins his appeal? Or if he wins his defamation suit? Should Johnny press charges in Australia over his severed finger?</p>\n<p>Yeah. I do too.</p>", "photo": {"id": "225270885", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/1/yp/om/ahyPoMgOnXIvGwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614623031", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjU5", "hasNextPage": true}}}}}, {"data": {"petition": {"id": "14451136", "slug": "dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2", "user": {"id": "24448735", "displayName": "Jeanne Larson", "photo": {"id": "221862322", "userSmall": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/7/xs/ly/cXXSLydpSVDqIVB-48x48-noPad.jpg?1553098061", "processing": false}}}, "organization": null, "updatesConnection": {"nodes": [{"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28619185", "createdAt": "2021-02-26T19:57:00.000Z", "title": "Amber Heard Physically unfit?", "description": "<p>It\u2019s looking more and more like Amber Heard really won\u2019t be in Aquaman 2.</p>\n<p>This petition has reported long since that Heard\u2019s contract has been bought out by WB and that she won\u2019t appear in Aquaman 2. But the masses want proof, rightfully so. Well, the more time goes by, the more it looks like we might actually have been properly informed.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s being reported lately that Emilia Clarke might have signed on to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. But, again, there\u2019s no confirmation, though an article in Forbes seems to be as legit a source as it gets. So we can\u2019t be sure about that part of the speculation about Amber Heard\u2019s dubious future in AM2.</p>\n<p>However\u2026</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf2AgE2eE8M\" rel=\"nofollow\">Popcorned Planet</a>\u2019s Andy Signore went on record saying: \u201cThe part of this story that is true is that, yes, Amber Heard is fired from Aquaman 2. Now, from what I\u2019ve heard so far she\u2019s been fired from Aquaman 2. From what I\u2019ve heard through a source, though other people that are involved in the production is that it already happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Previously, we\u2019ve heard that WB bought out Heard\u2019s contract because she might not be bondable (due to alcohol and drug use, perhaps?). If she can\u2019t be insured for the duration of filming, she can\u2019t film.</p>\n<p>But the reason might be something completely different than what we thought.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/movies/amber-heard-aquaman-2-contract-terminated-for-health-fitness-reasons/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sausage Roll</a>, Amber Heard might not appear in AM2 because she \u2018s not physically fit enough. They say: \u201cAmber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She\u2019s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.\u201d</p>\n<p>True to form, Heard manages to blame Johnny Depp for it, throwing Covid in for good measure. \u201cHeard allegedly blamed Johnny Depp and COVID-19 for her deteriorating health, saying that she\u2019s been under tremendous amount of stress and has been suffering from depression but she insists that she will get back in shape.\u201d</p>\n<p>Filming for Aquaman 2 is set to start filming in June (2021), so it remains to be seen whether or not she\u2019ll get back in shape. We\u2019ll also have to wait and see if she is, or becomes, bondable for filming.</p>\n<p>That seems like a lot to happen in just a few months.</p>\n<p>Also, according to another industry insider, Heard may have failed to report an injury. If she were injured, failed to report it and got further injured during training, which is quite rigorous, the studio would have been on the hook for it. So, it's entirely possible that this is the nature of Heard being physically unfit.</p>\n<p>Whichever the reason it seems more likely than not that the rumors about Amber Heard not appearing in AM2 are true. I don\u2019t know whether it will Emelia Clarke or not that takes over, but I\u2019m totally on board with it if it is.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Will Amber Heard fit back into the fish suit again or will we see somebody else taking over screen time in AM2?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.small-screen.co.uk/amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-mera-dc-comics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></p>", "photo": {"id": "225260964", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/4/rk/tm/UwrKTMBCvDQOQLj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614369423", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28613653", "createdAt": "2021-02-25T21:01:42.000Z", "title": "Johnny Depp pissed off?", "description": "<p>The latest story coming from leaker Daniel Richtman is saying that <a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/johnny-depp-reportedly-furious-amber-heard-job-offers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Depp is furious</a> that his ex-wife Amber Heard\u2019s star appears to be rising as his falls.

So even if he\u2019s eventually vindicated, he might never again be the A-lister he once was.</p>\n<p>Where to start.</p>\n<p>First, the sober truth is that Heard is a little long in the tooth to portray a Disney princess. Those girls are usually in their mid-teens, and Heard is twice that age now. It\u2019s highly unlikely that she\u2019s up for any such part.</p>\n<p>Second, after Heard has pestered Disney with subpoenas and legal shenanigans, it\u2019s not likely at all that they would line up to sign her for anything, let alone a role half her age.</p>\n<p>Third, Johnny is not hurting for work. If you look at Depp\u2019s <a href=\"https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000136?rf=cons_nm_meter&amp;ref_=cons_nm_meter\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDB pro</a> page, he\u2019s lined up to be involved with more than twenty projects.</p>\n<p>Heard has <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2 projects</a> on her books. Aquaman 2, which she probably won\u2019t appear in. Strong rumor has it that Emilia Clark will replace Heard in Aquaman 2.</p>\n<p>The other project is \u201cRun away with me\u201d a project which was abandoned years ago. Two movies she will most likely not even appear in. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all she\u2019s got scheduled for future projects.</p>\n<p>Finally, but not least, it\u2019s looking more and more like Johnny Depp is going to be vindicated in both court proceedings, leaving him in a much more favorable position than Heard.</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s not quite as bleak for Depp as Richtman would have you believe. Either his information is faulty or he\u2019s just plain wrong.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Is Heard\u2019s star rising? Or is Depp coming out on top?</p>", "photo": {"id": "225257223", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/8/pj/sq/bdpJsQhkPxDtqNI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614286904", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28602060", "createdAt": "2021-02-24T00:26:36.000Z", "title": "Trial date pushed back", "description": "<p>The defamation suit Johnny Depp took out against his ex wife Amber Heard was scheduled to on May 7th, 2021.

That cuts down on scheduling conflicts and keeps actors from negotiating for a better deal in-between each picture. But that\u2019s not always the case. Just as often, they take it one film at a time.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Aquaman franchise, it looks like they opted to do one film at a time. If that is indeed the case, no actor is guaranteed a part in the second or third installment.</p>\n<p>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Amber Heard is already scrambling to try to secure her place in Aquaman 3, even though AM2 hasn\u2019t even begun to film yet.</p>\n<p>There are doubts about whether or not Heard will even appear in AM2. Almost 2 million people have made it clear that they don\u2019t want to see Amber Heard in any further AM films, and it\u2019s possible that WB is paying attention. One rumor has it that Heard\u2019s screen time in AM2 is being severely curtailed, with another female lead taking on more screen time.</p>\n<p>Other rumors whisper that Heard\u2019s contract has been bought out, meaning that while Heard got paid, she will not appear in the film at all.</p>\n<p>There are several factors that will likely determine whether Heard comes back in any subsequent Aquaman films. First, there are the court cases going back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. Depp is suing Heard for Defamation for portraying him as a domestic abuser who physically abused and terrorized her throughout their marriage. Depp is having none of that is on a legal crusade to clear his good name and prove that it was Heard who was the abuser the entire time. Heard has a lot of sob storied and the support of her friends to back up her abuse storied, while Depp has video and audio recordings of her admitting to abusing him. Unlike Heard, Depp also has medical evidence, including a fingertip that got severed and a burn on his cheek from a cigarette being put out on his face.</p>\n<p>The two are also embroiled in litigation in England from a libel case that Depp leveled against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, for calling Depp a wife-beater. Initially, the judgement favored the Sun, who repeated that wife-beater claim again. But Depp is appealing the verdict, and will likely prevail.</p>\n<p>If these two cases go Depp\u2019s way, it doesn\u2019t bode well for Heard\u2019s continued presence in the AM franchise. Most films have a morals clause in their contracts, and if Heard is proven to be a domestic abuser again, that clause might very well be invoked.</p>\n<p>I say \u201cagain\u201d because Heard was arrested in 2009 for domestic abuse against her then wife Tasya Van Ree.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the issue of whether or not Heard is bondable. That is to say, whether or not she can be insured for the duration of filming. If she can\u2019t be insured for any reason, like a preexisting medical condition, excessive drug or alcohol abuse, she can\u2019t and won\u2019t be hired for any future AM project.</p>\n<p>Heard supporters insist that she\u2019ll be in AM2 and 3 because there hasn\u2019t been any official announcement from WB about her being dropped. But that\u2019s not the way it works. If Heard has been dropped, there likely won\u2019t be any announcement. The movie will simply come out without her in it. So fans who want her dropped who are waiting for an announcement won\u2019t get one. We\u2019ll just have to wait for the film to come out to see whether she\u2019s in it or not.</p>\n<p>Time will have to tell whether or not Amber Heard is in Aquaman 2, let alone Aquaman 3. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how those court cases come out, and whether or not Heard is bondable. As ever, I\u2019ll bring you the latest as I find it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-reportedly-secure-aquaman-3-role/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOURCE</a></p>", "photo": {"id": "225216787", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/2/vs/aa/UavsAaslEgIsluk-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613422168", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28550493", "createdAt": "2021-02-14T20:58:00.000Z", "title": "Amber Heard is a nobody", "description": "<p>Amber Heard is a nobody, at least according to Amber Heard.

TWO people that she\u2019s upset at for: 1) saying they\u2019re proud of Johnny Depp for fighting to clear his name, and 2) refer to the defendant (Heard), a movie star, as \u201ca nobody.\u201d And she had to put that in there, that she\u2019s \u201ca movie star.\u201d She needed to point that out, I suppose, in case anybody forgets that she got lucky off the back of being married to Johnny Depp and scored Aquaman. Would she have gotten that movie on her own? Anybody? Bueller?</p>\n<p>She\u2019s throwing everything she can at the wall with regards to Twitter users, hoping that something will stick.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, all of the statements she\u2019s throwing around by Twitter fans are protected opinions of celebrities. People just don\u2019t like her, and there\u2019s not one single thing she can do about it.</p>\n<p>What I suspect, however, is that she doesn\u2019t really expect any of this Twitter bluster to stick to the wall. I think it\u2019s a diversionary tactic, intended to direct attention away from the avalanche of evidence Johnny Depp has that\u2019s bearing down on her.</p>\n<p>And it works. For a minute. But she\u2019s deluding only herself if she thinks that the people who support Johnny Depp are about to lose sight of the big picture. They might point fingers and laugh at her folly when she tries some new antic, but they\u2019re steadfast to the case at the heart of the matter.</p>\n<p>What will she pull next? What new filing will she throw at the court to try to filibuster her way out of the inevitable? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. One thing that\u2019s sure is that it\u2019ll bring out more finger pointing and giggles, at least until the final verdicts come down. Then it will be Johnny Depp that gets the last laugh.</p>\n<p>Hat tip to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poopah73/status/1360310642968850437\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lizzie Borden</a></p>", "photo": {"id": "225213452", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/2/ba/uv/AubAUvMnVkryAij-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613336282", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28532880", "createdAt": "2021-02-11T14:36:03.000Z", "title": "iO tries to quash subpoena", "description": "<p>iO Tillet-Wright, fast friend of Amber Heard, is the guy that called 911 the fateful night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s last fight.

Blood on a pillow, hair on the floor, that sort of thing. Mind you, iO never witnessed any violence, just saw that (staged?) scene afterwards.</p>\n<p>Now, iO is trying to quash the subpoena calling for him to appear for a deposition.</p>\n<p>In his motion to quash, iO says: \u201cI am not a party to the above-referenced actions. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would completely do so.\u201d</p>\n<p>But\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI have never been served with any subpoena in this action (Case No. 19stcp04763) or in the Virginia Fairfax County Court Action (Case no.

See Wright Cecl. At \u00b6 3-5. First, he does not reside at the address listed on the Subpoena nor does he have any ownership interest in that address. Id., at \u00b63, Mr. Wright has spoken with a man named Anthony who was at the address listed on the \u201cproof of service\u201d on January 19 2021 and was told that a process server left a pile of papers on the front step. Id., at \u00b65. Mr. Wright does not know why anyone would say that they served him because they simply did not. Id., at \u00b6 4. In the light of the foregoing, the subpoenas are procedurally defective and should be quashed.</p>\n<p>Okay, then.</p>\n<p>First, if iO has no ownership or interest in that address, how does he know who was there on that day or any other? He clearly knows more than he's letting on, to have spoken with a man he says was there that day.</p>\n<p>Look, I don\u2019t care one way or another where iO lives, but this just doesn\u2019t add up.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s iO so scared of that he\u2019s trying to dodge his subpoena?

She took care of Waldman by successfully lobbying to get him removed from Johnny Depp's upcoming Fairfax defamation case against Amber Heard. That backfired, though, since removing Waldman from the case left him free to discuss the case freely. And he has been. Check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adam_waldman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Waldman's Twitter</a> feed to read some delightful insights into the case.</p>\n<p>And it's obvious that the petition bothers Heard, who mentions it prominently in her $100 million dollar countersuit.</p>\n<p>It's not the first time action has been taken to try and get the petition removed. Not long ago, negative comments were posted on the petition, and then reported as violations to try to get the petition taken down.</p>\n<p>That didn't work, and this isn't going to, either. I've already been in contact with Change.org, and rest assured. The petition is quite safe.</p>\n<p>Johnny Depp has a hearing on 18 March regarding his appeal in the UK libel case against the Sun, and the defamation suit in Fairfax is due to start in May - if it's not pushed back due to Covid.</p>\n<p>With these cases looming so large, it's possible that more shenanigans will pop up trying to further discredit Adam Waldman and attack the petition.

She spoke before panels and worked hard to try to reform domestic abuse laws.</p>\n<p>Today, she came forward with the name of her <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/02/01/marilyn-manson-accused-horrifically-abusing-evan-rachel-wood/4335539001/#:~:text=Manson%2C%20in%20a%202009%20Q%26A,told%20the%20outlet%20of%20Wood.\" rel=\"nofollow\">alleged abuser: Marilyn Manson</a>. The two got together when Wood was in her teens and MM was in his thirties.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of people who immediately believe Wood because of her history of talking about this alleged abuse, and because Manson is just so weird. Also because he wrote in his autobiography that he used to be an abusive piece of shit and that he used to imagine crushing her skull with a sledgehammer. And for saying that the song \u201cI Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies\u201d was inspired by one of their breakups.</p>\n<p>On top of that, four other women have stepped forward with similar accusations of their own against MM.</p>\n<p>All of that, along with Wood\u2019s disturbing allegations have a lot of people willing to crucify MM on the nearest telephone pole.</p>\n<p>What does that have to do with Amber Heard or Aquaman 2? At first glance, nothing. But if we take a closer look, the associations abound.</p>\n<p>First, ERW is \u201cclose\u201d friends with Heard. Wood has come out in <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/Evan-Rachel-Wood-defends-Amber-Heard-amid-her-feud-with-Johnny-Depp/articleshow/53280392.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\">support of Heard</a>\u2019s allegations against Johnny Depp since Heard first started to allege them \u2013 which is just about the time that Wood started talking about being a victim of domestic abuse. Coincidence number one.</p>\n<p>Also, it\u2019s a pretty well-known fact that MM is (or was) best of buddies with Johnny Depp. The two of them haven\u2019t been seen together in about a year, but they have a long history of being besties. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case isn\u2019t really known.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a fact that as far as I know, none of the women accusing MM ever called the police or filed any reports. The only word we have is in the media and on social media. I\u2019m not saying that makes them liars, far from it. A lot of victims never report their abuse. Johnny Depp didn\u2019t call the police. He relied upon his own private security to protect him.</p>\n<p>All I\u2019m saying is that the allegations against MM are pretty severe, with women saying they\u2019ve been violently raped, had their lives threatened, were locked in closets, were beaten, even whipped, and more. With allegations so severe, it\u2019s easy to wonder why the police weren\u2019t called, at least by one of them. It would certainly make the allegations easier to swallow.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m also not saying MM didn\u2019t do it. His own words in his autobiography don\u2019t bode well for him, certainly.</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m saying is that we need to wait and see some proof, one way or the other. Until that happens, all we have is a she-say/he-say situation.</p>\n<p>It could come down in a number of ways. MM could be the heartless, sadistic monster his self-proclaimed victims say he is, and he should be locked up for life.</p>\n<p>Or it could come down that the girls are in cahoots. Wood and Heard, I mean. The two of them, friends, have been alleging abuse against MM and Johnny Depp for roughly the same amount of time, and now would be a great time to come forward with MM\u2019s name, what with the legalities between Heard and Johnny Depp shaping up the way they are. It\u2019s not looking too good for Heard in the Fairfax, VA defamation case Johnny has leveled against her. So what better time to cut the legs out from under Johnny\u2019s bff with allegations of even more monstrous abuse?</p>\n<p>Or the two cases could have nothing whatsoever to do with each other but coincidence.</p>\n<p>Right now, it\u2019s too soon to call.</p>\n<p>One thing that is a fact is that Amber Heard has made it more difficult for victims of either gender to come forward with their stories of abuse thanks to her lies about being abused. Her sh*tstorm of mainstream media stories and crusade through the #MeToo movement have made it nigh impossible for anybody to come forward without enduring intense scrutiny. Gone are the days when we could #BelieveAllWomen. Heard\u2019s completely ruined that.</p>\n<p>So yeah. While there is a faction ready to believe her outright, ERW is being looked at with some skepticism by a large contingency.</p>\n<p>The only real truth here is that time will have to tell the truth of what\u2019s going on. My suggestion is to neither believe nor deny these allegations against MM until there\u2019s some shred of proof to back them up, or to prove that they\u2019re false.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what happened with Johnny Depp. He was accused of domestic abuse and a lot of people believed it. Then proof came out that those allegations were false.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying we should do here. Wait for some proof. Reserve judgement until we know definitively, one way or the other. The truth always outs, and it will in this case, too.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Hang the dude\u2019s reputation on her word? Or wait and see?</p>", "photo": {"id": "225158142", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/9/rl/ds/fMrlDSKhJQkHUzj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1612224157", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28461870", "createdAt": "2021-01-31T20:03:22.000Z", "title": "What is Amber Heard worth?", "description": "<p>There's <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es_GRo6XIAAOXJ_?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">THIS</a> snippet from some magazine suggesting that Heard was paid $7 million dollars for her part as Mera in Aquaman 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>\n<p>Jason Momoa's total net worth is reported to be $14 million, and that's combined with his wife, former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet's net worth.

Heard successfully argued against it, refusing to let the court make any such allowances for him. That might, in part, have been why Johnny Depp was asked to step down from the franchise. His filming schedule would have been interrupted - partly by that three-day deposition she made him sit for that conflicted with filming.</p>\n<p>Well, now the shoe is on the other foot.</p>\n<p>Because of court's Covid-related scheduling conflicts, the case may very well be pushed back into what she claims will be HER filming schedule.

See Countercl. Paragraph 6. Nothing in that allegation implies facts showing that the change.org petitions included obscene language, threatened illegal or immoral acts, or suggest or propose obscene acts. See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Likewise, the allegation that Mr. Depp \u201ccreated, coordinated, controlled, and/or manipulated social media accounts created specifically for the purpose of targeting Ms. Heard,\u201d also fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See VA code 18.2-152.7:1. The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Because neither of those allegations meet the second element of the VCCA, they cannot move forward in this litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>So the court didn\u2019t buy all that nonsense about Johnny Depp\u00a0 being responsible for these petition and all us \u201cRussian bots.\u201d So even the court recognizes how ridiculous that claim was.</p>\n<p>The only bummer about it is that now, I probably won\u2019t be called to testify that Johnny Depp had nothing to do with the creation or maintenance of this petition.

Now, a lot of folks on the internet are campaigning to see Heard suffer the same treatment. In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 is nearing a staggering 2 million signatures. And while WB has yet to announce any plans to hire another actress for the role, it seems that they\u2019re trying to come up with a compromise.</p>\n<p>With all of this going on, it looks like WB is gearing up to either reduce Amber Heard\u2019s role in Aquaman 2 or write her out altogether.</p>\n<p>According to Grace Randolph, the host of the \u201cBeyond The Trailer\u201d YouTube channel, the studio is bringing on another female lead to \u2018balance things out.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of you are asking re Amber Heard \u2013 as I told you before, they are bringing on this new female lead to balance things out, and writing the script so that Heard\u2019s role can be cut down if needed. But as of right now she\u2019s still in Aquaman 2,\u201d the journalist wrote on her Twitter feed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As we learned last month, Warner Bros. may not be able to fire the\u00a0London Fields\u00a0star if it comes to it due to her contract. What they can do, however, is find a way to sideline her character in favor of a newcomer in Aquaman 2. To what extent they\u2019ll do so, though, is anyone\u2019s guess at this point.</p>\n<p>Another source has maintained that al of this speculation is pointless, as Amber Heard has already been removed from Aquaman 2. If those sources are to be believed, it\u2019s true that Amber Heard can\u2019t be officially fired, but that she\u2019s been bought out of her contract. Pretty much the same situation as Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts. They fired Johnny, but paid his contract. That\u2019s what it\u2019s rumored happened to heard. They basically paid her not to be in Aquaman 2.</p>\n<p>Aquaman 2\u00a0is due to start shooting in Australia after the new year ahead of its scheduled release in December 2022.

As I understand it, there have been a couple of DUI\u2019s and rumor has it that there was at least one other arrest for domestic violence. I don\u2019t know against whom, but it looks like we\u2019re going to find out.</p>\n<p>If this is true and Amber Has multiple arrests against her for domestic violence, it could be crucial in helping Johnny Depp establish that it was Heard who was violent in their relationship.</p>\n<p>On the same day, a subpoena was issued to the ACLU, one of the organizations to which Heard swears she donated part of her 7 million dollar divorce settlement. It \u00a0has long been rumored that Heard didn\u2019t donate to these organizations as she swore in her divorce documents, legal court documents, that she would.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know exactly what could happen to Heard if she kept the money and didn\u2019t donate it, or didn\u2019t donate all of it, like she said she would. Contempt of court, maybe? Or would this even be grounds for the divorce to be revisited? Could she owe that money back to Johnny? We\u2019ll have to wait and see what the fallout is, but the fact is that she will now have to prove in a court of law what she did with that money.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, it goes to her credibility if she swore to donate that money and didn\u2019t. Not that her credibility holds much weight anymore.</p>\n<p>Three days later, the court issued a subpoena for iO Tillet Wright, longtime friend and flying monkey of Heard\u2019s. <a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/high-profile/depp%20v%20heard/cl-2019-2911-foreign-subp-prep-io-tillet-wright-12-18-2020.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The service notice</a> doesn\u2019t say whether it was Heard\u2019s side or Johnny\u2019s that requested the subpoena. It would be interesting to see who called iO. It\u2019ll be even more interesting to see how far iO is willing to go to perjure himself for Heard. It\u2019s one thing to lie to a court abroad where they can\u2019t touch you. It\u2019s another thing to perjure oneself in America where they can easily find you and level perjury charges. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how far any of her friends are willing to perjure themselves.</p>\n<p>It bears note that some of those previously pro-Heard folks are deleting their social media en masse. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to the defamation case that\u2019s looming ever larger, but it\u2019s certainly possible.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, it looks like Amber Heard\u2019s legal world is crashing down on her. I wonder what her response will be when Johnny wins his defamation case, and then wins his appeal in the libel case he leveled against the Sun tabloid and subsequently lost. I wonder what the whole world\u2019s reaction will be. So many have been so quick to vilify him.

On their official website, Amber Heard is described her as \u201cAn outspoken advocate for women\u2019s rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence around the world, Amber works with organizations that encourage survivors both personally and politically to come forward and reclaim their power. Amber makes frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence.\u201d<br><br>If you\u2019d like to hire her to speak at your event, she can be booked for the princely sum of $33,000.

A large contingency of the public view Heard as a woman who abused her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as she admitted as much on audiotape. Those people find it ludicrous that Heard should dare to claim to be a spokesperson for survivors when she herself is an admitted abuser with a history of being arrested for domestic abuse against wife Tasya Van Ree in 2009.</p>\n<p>Heard has already spoken at the Global Citizen Festival, the Social Good Summit and the L\u2019Oreal Women of Worth awards, leading the reader to believe that Heard was paid to speak at those events. So, with a payday of up to $33,000 per appearance, her outpouring of heartfelt civic duty doesn\u2019t exactly come across as altogether altruistic, does it? Rather, she seems motivated by the payday, which some would argue has always been her only impetus.</p>\n<p>I for one will be interested to see how many people or organizations will hire Heard to speak for such a hefty payday.

Was it back when they were together? Sometime since?

If Johnny wanted to give his ex some money, for whatever reason, there\u2019s no reason whatsoever that he couldn\u2019t just do so. He gave Vanessa money, too, and there\u2019s nothing shady about it. By all accounts, he\u2019s a generous guy. Why shouldn\u2019t he be able to give his ex some money if he wants to?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry, folks, but it doesn\u2019t quite wash. They talk about scrutiny, but the fact is that there are far too few details for a claim like this to stand up to even the most casual scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The point here, is that headlines like this are juicy and look damning on the surface, but you need to look a little deeper to determine if there\u2019s any substance to back them up. This is just one among many allegations being tossed about in the press since the court in the UK ruled against him in his libel case against the Sun. The media\u2019s been having a field day at Johnny\u2019s expense, and there\u2019s no more substance to those headlines than there are to this one. It\u2019s just a bunch of fluffed-up rubbish set forth with no more justification than that someone said so.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t take the headlines seriously, boys and girls, no matter how good \u2013 or bad \u2013 they look. There\u2019s a good chance that it\u2019s just a bunch of unfounded allegations being printed to sell papers. Or to get clicks online. That\u2019s all. They, the papers, don\u2019t care about the truth. If they did, they\u2019d be exposing Johnny Depp\u2019s abuser, proven by her own words, rather than serving the victim up on a platter the way they are. So don\u2019t give them the satisfaction of giving their trash a second glance. Stick to the world of facts which have been proven, tried and true, by the abuser herself.</p>\n<p>The truth will out in the end. It\u2019s no coincidence that this article came out at the same time as Johnny applied to the higher court to move forward with his appeal to overturn the verdict in the Sun case. Like I said before, it\u2019s all an agenda that\u2019s being spoon fed to you. Don\u2019t swallow it.</p>\n<p>Keep your wits about you, folks, and keep fighting the good fight. We'll end up on the right side of the roaring rapids in the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOURCE</a> - which I hope you don't click on.</p>", "photo": {"id": "224954427", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/0/ax/gn/vfaxgnDqaEbcrOH-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607558034", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28173276", "createdAt": "2020-12-05T17:52:18.000Z", "title": "Steven Crowley and Amber Heard", "description": "<p>Steven Crowley is an actor that knew and worked with Amber Heard on a movie called \u201cNever Back Down.\u201d He recently posted on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@stevencrowley/video/6899955612692516101?_d=secCgsIARCbDRgBIAMoARI%2BCjwJwKV1Z7iPseiCnqcCqgorvxQKfKudCC6U7odEm%2BcVhDyZL7DW5DPEBlgxJ6RT3XEjlQvarTehNaYz1yEaAA%3D%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAASEfHqDmQjy3OT_mgTD_dVC8Q2fpeea5FYcGo9DQOmhwG6MdY7e95hhOPSQMv1VQ8&amp;share_item_id=6899955612692516101&amp;share_link_id=702327CC-07B7-4399-BF29-AEB9E9D6537B&amp;timestamp=1606655972&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=d26ea8e5m5j667&amp;user_id=6602617470308057093&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tik Tok</a> that he has his own stories about Amber Heard and promised to do a YouTube about them. He posted a picture of himself and Amber Heard with the caption \u201cMe trying not to get beat up every day on set for 3 months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, on December 2nd, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title\" rel=\"nofollow\">that video</a> went up on YouTube. Steven and his buddy Jason were chatting away, and then, about 12 minutes in, Steven starts talking about Amber Heard. He described first meeting her as sex personified, and so charming and overpowering that if she\u2019d told him to go out and kill somebody, he would have done it. Not really, of course, but he was illustrating how much influence she can have on people, even at first sight. At least back then.</p>\n<p>He went on to talk about Amber and the fights that she used to get into with her wife Tasya Van Ree, saying that they were real blow up fights. He also hinted at Amber\u2019s drug and alcohol consumption as activities that he saw with his own two eyes.</p>\n<p>Steven also talked about how Amber Heard was when she worked with Johnny Depp on the Rum Diary. Heard wasn\u2019t even remotely interested in Depp. She was married to Tasya, but was well aware of Johnny\u2019s interest in her, he said. It wasn\u2019t until after another couple of movies failed, a tv show failed, then all of a sudden you hear about Amber Heard being with Johnny Depp, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, she started getting parts.</p>\n<p>Amber Heard was with Johnny Depp to further her career. That\u2019s what Steven said without saying it.</p>\n<p>Steven beat around the bush about a LOT of stories he said he could tell, but he was scared to death of getting sued if he told them. Jason assured Steven that the truth is the ultimate defense against a law suit, and that maybe these stories need to be told so that the world has both sides of the situation, not just the one that Heard is telling the world. Still, Steven hesitated and ultimately refused to say any more. The two agreed to talk about this more off-screen and then come back and revisit the issue in a future video.</p>\n<p>What strikes me the most about the whole thing is how scared Steven was to talk about events he saw with his own two eyes. And, he said, there are a lot more people with stories to tell that are afraid to talk, too.</p>\n<p>Why? Why are these people afraid of her? Because she\u2019ll sue them? Like Jason said, the truth is the best defense against that. And it\u2019s not just a matter of he say/She say if multiple people are stepping forward to corroborate each other\u2019s stories. And I\u2019m sure there are some people with photos or videos to back their stories up. They just have to work up the nerve to step forward and speak up.</p>\n<p>All it takes is for one person to say \u201cenough\u201d and stand up. Once that first brave soul makes a stand and speaks out against Amber Heard, I think the floodgates will open up and everybody else who\u2019s been holding back stories will come forward too. And it\u2019ll be high time. This no-talent would-be actress has held her reign of terror long enough.</p>\n<p>And I think that with the VA trial coming up, her web is going to start falling apart. She\u2019s having to subpoena people who were previously willing to talk about her freely. I think they\u2019re starting to realize what they\u2019ve got to lose, and that her ship is sinking. And it is. The USS Amber Heard is taking on water, more every day. It\u2019s only a matter of time until those rats start hopping off. I think we\u2019re seeing it already.</p>\n<p>By all means, go have a look at Steven Crowley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title\" rel=\"nofollow\">video</a>. See for yourself all of the stories he hints at being able to tell about her, and witness how afraid he is to talk.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s the one that starts the ball rolling about Heard. It\u2019ll make him a hero of epic proportions. He might just by a lynchpin if they get him involved with the VA case.</p>\n<p>Come on, Steven.

Now there are rumors that his ex-wife, Amber Heard, is in talks with Margot Robbie to appear in a remake of Pirates heavily laden with what Robbie calls \u201cGirl Power.\u201d</p>\n<p>With this rumor about Pirates, what Heard insists will be her return to Aquaman 2 despite this petition that has more than 1.5 million signatures, and possibly a spinoff featuring Mera, her Aquaman role, it might look like Heard is riding high on a wave of professional success.</p>\n<p>But let\u2019s take a look at that, shall we?</p>\n<p>First, there\u2019s absolutely no substance to the rumor that Heard is getting anywhere near Pirates. Daniel Richtman said so on his Patreon account, and internet news sources have picked it up and run with it, but there\u2019s no proof whatsoever. I could say that I\u2019M going to be in Pirates, but that doesn\u2019t make it true. Unfortunately, though, we live in a society where any tabloid rumor is considered news. But not everything you read is true, so don't take it on gospel just because it's on the internet.</p>\n<p>Next, Aquaman 2. While Heard insists that she\u2019ll be returning as Mera, there are a couple factors that make me doubt it. For one thing, the word through the grapevine is that WB bought out her contract. If that\u2019s true, they paid her NOT to be in the movie. For another thing, the movie will shoot in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to when she smuggled her dogs into the country in violation of Australia\u2019s bio-laws. She could get arrested if she shows up there. And the main cast usually knows exactly when production is going to start, and all she can say is \u201cNext year.\u201d Nah, I sincerely doubt that Heard\u2019s going to appear in AM2.</p>\n<p>A Mera spinoff? There\u2019s even less of a reason to believe that this is happening, and that\u2019s saying something. There might have been a time when this idea was bantered about, which is understandable considering the popularity of the original film, and WB might be looking to ramp up their own girl power front. But now, with Heard\u2019s troubles, I sincerely doubt that a spinoff is going to happen. You can see all of the reasons I gave above regarding her return to Aquaman. And you can add the whispers that Heard is unbondable, which would mean that she can\u2019t be insured for filming. No insurance, no filming. Not for Pirates, AM2, and definitely not for her own film franchise.</p>\n<p>No, folks. These rumors of all these great projects are just that. Rumors. Spoon fed to the media by someone with an agenda. It sounds like Heard is trying to not only obliterate her ex, Johnny Depp, in courts and in the press. It looks like she\u2019s trying to replace him. What\u2019s next? Heard being prominently featured in a Harry Potter film? It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that rumor started floating around, too.</p>\n<p>Be careful what you believe in the press, folks. Until those rumors can be corroborated, take \u2018em with a pinch of salt. The proof is in the pudding, and I\u2019ve got a feeling that Heard is going to leave us all starving.</p>", "photo": {"id": "224909480", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/0/cy/xp/ndCYXprYUnoLzox-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606449372", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28123888", "createdAt": "2020-11-25T21:23:15.000Z", "title": "Appeal denied, but there's still hope", "description": "<p>Johnny Depp was recently dealt a blow when he lost his libel case against NgN and The Sun tabloid.

By the same judge that found against him in the first place, (in)Justice Nicol.</p>\n<p>Got that? The SAME JUDGE that found against Johnny in the first place turned down his bid for an appeal, saying that he did not believe that Johnny's appeal had a \"reasonable prospect of success.

Apparently, going through (in)justice Nicol for the first part of the appeal was just a step that had to be taken as a matter of routine. Now, Johnny can take the case directly to the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p>That's the good news. Most likely, Johnny's appeal has every chance of being victorious, meaning that the original court finding will be overturned.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that the appeal process could take as long as 2 years.

I asked them to hide my comments for a while so that they can\u2019t be spammed and then reported as violations. I don\u2019t like that the comments are off, I like for people to be able to speak their minds.

However, in the UK system, the journalist in question has to prove to a court that they weren\u2019t acting in bad faith and to justify the accuracy of their reporting.</p>\n<p>So The Sun got away with it because all they had to do was say that they believed Amber Heard\u2019s claims in good faith, not that she was telling the truth.

Unfounded in reality, to coin her phrase.</p>\n<p>But then there\u2019s her contract with WB regarding Aquaman 2. Perhaps it is true that she can\u2019t be fired due to these legal proceedings. But that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be fired for other reasons. For example, most contracts these days have some sort of morals clause.</p>\n<p>And that doesn\u2019t mean that her contract can\u2019t be bought out by WB. That\u2019s a whole different circumstance. And reliable rumor has it that\u2019s exactly what happened. So when you hear claims in the press that Heard\u2019s position with WB is unshakable, or that she\u2019s got ALL these roles coming up, take it with a pinch of salt. Just remember those claims that she was going to be in a live-action Hercules movie? Right. She and her PR team can cook up whatever claims they want. Doesn\u2019t make them true.</p>\n<p>And remember, when it comes to how things are worded in the press, just remember there\u2019s more than one way to get things done. Take a look at the wording, then take a look around it. Just because she can\u2019t be fired for one reason, it doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be fired for another. And it certainly doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s going to be hired for anything new.</p>\n<p>Time will tell.</p>\n<p>What do you think?

She was dragged into the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard case when Whitney testified that she fled the situation and slept on Jennifer Howell\u2019s floor. Jennifer spoke up and corrected Whit by saying that she never made Whit sleep on the floor. Since then, it\u2019s come out that Whitney regularly confided in Jennifer about everything that was going on, including Amber being the bully in the staircase episode, and that Amber Heard took Johnny Depp\u2019s finger off. These are crucial points, since Amber Heard painted Johnny Depp as the aggressor in both cases.</p>\n<p>Originally, Amber Heard subpoenaed Jennifer Howell, likely expecting her to support her version of events, but was faced with the fact that Jennifer vows to tell the truth. That\u2019s not a good thing for Amber.</p>\n<p>So now, Johnny Depp\u2019s team has subpoenaed Jennifer Howell.</p>\n<p>Amber Heard\u2019s team jumped all over that, petitioning the court to deny Jennifer Howell\u2019s testimony, calling it irrelevant. But the court has denied that petition, saying that Jennifer Howell can definitely testify. This is the petition that the court called disingenuous, and sanctioned Amber Heard $4,732.50 for wasting the court\u2019s time.</p>\n<p>Court said that if Amber Heard thought Jennifer Howell was relevant enough to subpoena in the first place, she can\u2019t turn around and say that Jennifer Howell is irrelevant just because Johnny\u2019s team wants to subpoena her.</p>\n<p>On Jennifer Howell\u2019s Instagram, she says:</p>\n<p>I was recently subpoenaed into a court case to tell the truth, and I did so. Verdict came down on Monday and the actual truth was destroyed by an unjust system.<br>I share this now because I want to have faith in truth, dignity, love and integrity ultimately winning. My heart has been broken during this process as I have lost faith in so many people who have claimed to be moral and good yet lack the integrity to tell the truth when it might be \u201can inconvenience\u201d for them.<br>Those same people have contacted old employees of the charity and told them not to speak to attorneys and to dodge subpoenas. Have questioned my integrity for actually telling the truth when I was called to do so and much more. Heartbreaking to lose faith in people. I write this as I am trying not to lose faith in humanity, in justice and in the greater good... Truth and goodness have to win in the end.</p>\n<p>The VA case is going to be a jury trial, and I have a feeling that they\u2019re going to give Jennifer\u2019s testimony a great deal of weight, considering she\u2019s friends with the Heards, but is willing to tell the TRUTH regardless of the personal consequences to herself.</p>\n<p>I for one can\u2019t wait to see what Jennifer Howell says on the stand. It seems to me that her testimony will be a lynchpin in blowing Amber Heard\u2019s lies wide open, as well as everybody else who lied for her. That puts them ALL in the hot seat for perjury charges not just for the VA case, but also the UK case as well.</p>\n<p>Heard keeps digging her own hole deeper and deeper, and she\u2019s dragging people down with her.</p>\n<p>I personally think that it\u2019s only a matter of time before those rats start jumping off her sinking ship. I should take bets for who jumps first.</p>\n<p>Heard\u2019s little world is crumbling down around her and she\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p>You can check out Jennifer Howell's instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHLHoP-J-EQ/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a></p>", "photo": {"id": "224882908", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/5/pw/sh/mtpwShoILJyeSIg-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605871323", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "28085673", "createdAt": "2020-11-18T16:21:42.000Z", "title": "Amber Heard loses court ruling", "description": "<p>Amber Heard's motion to exclude information about her alleged donation to the Children's Hospital of LA is denied.

And it bears note that the plaintiff issued these subpoenas. Johnny Depp's lawyers, not Amber Heard's.</p>\n<p>If you don't remember, Tasya Van Ree was Amber Heard's domestic partner, who Amber was arrested for assaulting in 2009.</p>\n<p>We've all seen Rocky and iO lie for Amber, and even Tasya Van Ree once issued a statement downplaying the domestic violence incident.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What we haven't seen is Tasya Van Ree on the stand, under oath, willing to lie for Amber. And, really, she can't. She can try to downplay the incident, but she can't deny that it happened. And if the arresting officer is also called to testify, the severity of the attack will be on full display.</p>\n<p>So the question becomes whether or not Van Ree will be willing to outright lie for her former partner, under oath, risking a perjury charge.</p>\n<p>Were Rocky and iO called to the stand in the UK? Was Whitney? Was Josh Drew? How many of them will be willing to take the stand in America and commit perjury? The date for the VA trial is getting ever closer. It'll be interesting to see how many of them are willing to keep lying, or how many of those little rats start to jump ship as the date gets closer. Presumably, iO, Rocky and Van Ree have lives and livelihoods they don't want to risk losing by going to jail. And Whitney has a baby son she certainly doesn't want to leave so she can go and serve jail time for her abusive sister.</p>\n<p>Truth is, Amber's little make-believe world is closing in around her. Whatever power it is she thinks she's got over people is fragile at best. People have a self-preservation instinct that's stronger than whatever sword of Damocles she's got hanging over their heads.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, when the first rat cracks, the rest of them will hit the water like Ethel Merman choreographed it. Make no mistake about that.</p>\n<p>Now, while Amber might be celebrating what she thinks is a win in the UK, that story isn't finished. Johnny is certain to win his appeal, even if it does take up to two years for the process to run its course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And let's not forget that Amber's being investigated for perjury in Australia, and they're serious about putting her behind bars. Which begs the question, how is she going to travel to Australia to film Aquaman 2, as she claims, with that looming over her head?</p>\n<p>Nah. I've heard that Warner Bros bought out her contract, and that's the information I'm running with. I'd bet dollars to donuts that she won't be AM2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And I'm waiting to see which rat will jump ship first.</p>\n<p>Who do you think it will be? iO? Rocky? Tasya Van Ree? Whitney?

Not at all. Johnny has be represented by Virginia lawyer Benjamin Chew throughout these proceedings thus far, and he\u2019ll continue to do a fine job.

And he has to pay her the cost of filing this motion, as well as whatever other reasonable costs apply.</p>\n<p>So, basically, Johnny has to pay Amber for bullying him into interrupting filming in London in order to appear in Virginia for a deposition that easily could have waited until after his filming was concluded.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s keep in mind that it\u2019s not just three days at stake. There are quarantine periods as well. So it\u2019s not just a matter of days that filming is being disrupted by. It could be weeks.</p>\n<p>While I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Amber\u2019s intention to jerk Johnny around \u2013 maybe even get him fired from FB3 \u2013 she\u2019s also meddling with WB, forcing them to reschedule Johnny\u2019s filming and having to film around him. Is this something she\u2019d pull if she were still affiliated with Aquaman 2? I don\u2019t think so. She wouldn\u2019t risk her status with them if she still had the part.</p>\n<p>Heard might be feeling all victorious right about now, winning this little battle. But one battle doesn\u2019t win the war, and she will not win this one. The verdict will come down from London soon about Depp\u2019s libel case against the Sun for calling him a wife beater, and when it does, the whole world will be put on notice that the courts aren\u2019t buying her story about being a battered wife. The court in London won\u2019t buy it, and neither will the court in Virginia.</p>\n<p>She can enjoy what little bit of money she gets from Johnny right now, right up until she\u2019s forced to pay him $50 million for his defamation case. Since she\u2019s not worth that much to begin with, it\u2019ll be interesting to see where she gets the money.</p>\n<p>She can enjoy pushing him around for now, too. Because while she\u2019s getting her way this time, she does no control Johnny Depp any more. He caught wise to what kind of a monster she really is, and kicked her to the curb. Sure, he\u2019ll have to sit for the deposition, but she will not be the one asking questions. She shouldn\u2019t even be in the room, though I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll find a way to insert herself so that she can stare him down and witness his defeat. But that\u2019s the end of it. He\u2019s moved on with his life and regained his happiness. And no matter how much she thinks she can push him around, she can\u2019t take that away from him. Never again.</p>\n<p>And she can go ahead and enjoy breathing free air, while she can. She\u2019s got several chances to be thrown behind bars hanging over her head. First, there\u2019s no statute of limitations in Australia for violence that results in grievous bodily harm. Like cutting off somebody\u2019s finger. The only reason she hasn\u2019t been brought up on charges is because Johnny hasn\u2019t filed a claim against her. She owes the fact that she\u2019s not in jail right now to the man she\u2019s pushing around. She needs to think about that.</p>\n<p>Second, Australia\u2019s looking at her for Perjury in the case where she brought the yorkies, Pistol and Boo, into the country illegally. She lied in her statement to authorities, and now they know it.</p>\n<p>And, depending on how the verdict comes down in London, she could very well be facing perjury charges there, too. She lied her ass off in her testimony to the British courts, just like she\u2019s lied for the past four years about Johnny.</p>\n<p>Will they seek perjury charges in Virginia after she lies there, too? They certainly could. So let her do her little victory dance at this perceived victory. She won\u2019t be laughing when it\u2019s all over.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Will the London judge rule in favor of Depp or Heard? What do you think will happen in Virginia? Will Heard manage to pull another rabbit out of her hat? Or will Johnny prevail, clearing his name and forcing her to face justice?

She goes on and on about Waldman on Twitter, having puppies and kittens about other \u201cleaked\u201d materials and laundered information.</p>\n<p>What it really means is that Waldman\u2019s doing his job, Heard can\u2019t stand it, and she\u2019s doing everything she can to get rid of him.</p>\n<p>It also looks like she\u2019s so jealous of Johnny\u2019s popularity on social media that she can\u2019t see straight.

Mr. Depp should be able to show that Ms. Heard\u2019s false abuse claims were to leverage a larger settlement, that she did not donate the entirety of the proceeds. In connection with a third-party subpoena pending before the Hon. Stephanie M.

She will have the possibility of serving time in Australia for cutting Johnny's finger off for the rest of her life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, more recently, she's racking up quite a list of places where she can and should be charged for perjury. Oh, how I hope they take turns locking her up for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What do you think? Will Australia, the UK, or Virginia go after her for perjury?

But Heard objected to the delay. \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to Heard, she was told that Aquaman 2 would start filming in February, 2021.

They refer to AM2 as \u201cthat film\u201d and make no reference to Heard at all.</p>\n<p>It also goes to show that Heard is completely out of the loop with regard to AM2 production. She thought filming was going to start in February, when in fact, production is going to start months later. Seems to me if she were going to be involved with the movie, she would have been informed by now. All the principals have to know these things early so they can schedule accordingly.</p>\n<p>From the look of it, Heard has no idea whatsoever what\u2019s going on with AM2.

These include:</p>\n<p>1. All documents or communications with Mr. Depp that refer or relate to Ms. Heard<br>2. All documents or communications concerning the relationship between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard, including, but not necessarily limited to any violence or abuse between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard.<br>3. All documents or communications concerning any actual, alleged, or attempted acts of violence involving Mr. Depp.<br>4. All documents or communications concerning any actual alleged, or attempted alcohol or drug use or abuse by Mr. Depp from 2013 to present.<br>5. All documents of communications concerning any actual or alleged act of Mr. Depp that resulted in damage to property.<br>6. All documents concerning any decision to cast or not cast Mr. Depp in any future Pirates of the Caribbean films.<br>7. All contracts with or relating to Mr. Depp relating to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.<br>8. All documents or communications relating to any interviews, communications, or correspondence with press or entertainment trade publications concerning Mr. Depp.<br>9. All non-privileged documents or communications concerning any insurance policy or claims relating to any performance by Mr. Depp.</p>\n<p>I hardly know where to start. So I\u2019ll just start at the top. Any communications with Depp that relate to Ms. Heard. Why the hell would there be any communication between Disney and Ms. Heard? Does Heard\u2019s team think that Johnny regularly chatted up Disney about his marriage? That\u2019s ridiculous. Disney isn\u2019t any one person, it\u2019s a legal entity that exists on many levels, none of which includes marriage counseling. If there\u2019s any communication, it\u2019s from Disney telling Johnny that his wife was banned from the set because she was such a troublemaker during filming.</p>\n<p>Number 2, same thing. There\u2019s no reason there would be communications between Johnny and Disney about Heard at all, let alone anything about violence. But this is a slippery slope for Heard. IF there were any communications about violence, they are most likely about her being violent, not him.</p>\n<p>Number 3, asked and answered by number 2.</p>\n<p>Number 4, any actual alleged, or attempted alcohol or drug use or abuse by Mr. Depp. First, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that Disney babysat Johnny while he filmed, to know what he did or didn\u2019t do or drink. It would only be addressed if any such substance abuse became a problem for filming. Johnny is a consummate professional. We\u2019ve never heard that he was drunk on set. Just that he\u2019s a delight to work with. And secondly, what the hell is ATTEMPTED alcohol or drug use? That\u2019s such an absurd phrase that I\u2019m surprised any lawyer dared to put such a silly thing in actual court papers. Well, I guess they\u2019ll do anything they\u2019re paid to do.</p>\n<p>Number 5, Damage. What do they think? That Johnny wantonly went around smashing sets? For one thing, we would have heard about it in tabloids at the time. For another, Disney wouldn\u2019t have kept employing him if he were prone to smashing things up. They didn\u2019t dump him until Heard branded him as a wife-beater.</p>\n<p>Number 6, Any decision to cast or recast him in future films. That\u2019s not a legal argument, it\u2019s a personal fishing expedition. Yes, Johnny\u2019s asking for 50m because that\u2019s what he\u2019s out for losing Pirates, but it reads more like she\u2019s just desperate to know what work he\u2019ll be getting.</p>\n<p>Number 7, Asked and answered by number 6.</p>\n<p>Number 8, This is far too broad a request to be feasible. Any interviews, EVER, relating to Disney? Besides, what has his interviews got to do with her defaming him? This comes across as Amber trying to create such a fuss with Disney that they won\u2019t want to work with Johnny because of her. I hope the studio, and the judge, see through this abusive tactic and sent her packing.</p>\n<p>Number 9, any insurance policy or claims relating to any performance by Mr. Depp. I find this one to be really interesting. The way filming works is that actors have to be bonded, insured, in order to film. Can\u2019t film without being insured. So we already know that Johnny was insured for all past jobs with Disney or they wouldn\u2019t have happened. So this is another fishing expedition to find out if Johnny is insured for future projects, Pirates or otherwise. She\u2019s desperate to know what work he might have lined up with Disney in the future. It reeks of her wanting to know so that she can muck it up for him. I also think this request for his insurance information is highly ironic, since Heard herself is uninsurable. It reads to me like she's saying, \u201cIf I can\u2019t work, neither can he!\u201d</p>\n<p>Remind me again, who was the abuser here? Her supporters would say that he\u2019s the abuser by insisting upon these two court cases: the libel case in London and the Defamation case against her in VA. But let\u2019s not forget that during negotiations for their divorce, he BEGGED her to finish it up quietly to avoid court. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her reputation, he wanted to let her walk away. But it was SHE who kept running her mouth to any outlet she could think of, or pay for, labeling him as an abusive spouse and painting herself as the poor, embattled victim. She tried to ruin him, and she\u2019s still trying to ruin him. Only now, it\u2019s not just the public that gets to decide. It\u2019s a judge and a court, and they\u2019re not as gullible as I\u2019m sure she hopes they are. A few flimsy lies aren\u2019t going to hold up. They\u2019re too easily debunked, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Johnny is presenting evidence that he didn\u2019t do what she says he did. She\u2019s just hoping that if she throws enough paperwork into the air, it\u2019ll distract away from the evidence.</p>\n<p>Sorry, kid, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. Those judgments are coming, sooner than later. And there\u2019s not going to be anywhere to hide.</p>\n<p>All she\u2019s managing to do with this little stunt of hers is ensure that Disney will never want to work with her. Johnny will be just fine once she\u2019s legally forced to shut her yap. I, for one, can\u2019t wait for that day.</p>\n<p>Hat tip to Qwerty, the Real Laura B, and the Depp army on Twitter.</p>", "photo": {"id": "224576538", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/7/fj/uk/jyFJuKRQJBidbEm-800x450-noPad.jpg?1599846804", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27696770", "createdAt": "2020-09-10T19:28:18.000Z", "title": "Depp-osition", "description": "<p>Amber Heard's been screaming that Johnny Depp refuses to sit for his deposition, saying that he's dragging things out to torture her.</p>\n<p>As things stand right now, Depp is scheduled to sit for his deposition on October 5th, most likely via video link, though that's almost certain to change.</p>\n<p>Depp has filed for a continuance to allow for his filming schedule for Fantastic Beasts 3.

The case needs to end, and end soon.\"</p>\n<p>That's not the way things work, of course, but there's no telling Heard that. She claims that Johnny and his lawyer Adam Waldman are waging a \"campaign of terror\" against her by posting on social media, and she calls for this abuse to end as soon as possible.

He could, and should have worked his filming schedule around his deposition instead. She thinks, apparently, that Depp has the power to make a multi-million dollar film, its cast, crew, and schedule revolve around him, at her whim.</p>\n<p>Doesn\u2019t work that way. It would cost millions for the movie to wait for him to go to court, if that were even possible. Court is flexible. Filming a movie is not.</p>\n<p>Heard also says that it is of the utmost importance that the trial proceed as scheduled so that she can put a stop to Depp\u2019s \u201cdaily\u201d smear campaign of her through social media.</p>\n<p>More than that, she bemoans the cost of maintaining her legal defense for an additional five months, the amount of time Depp is seeking.</p>\n<p>She says that requesting a continuance, in part, because of Covid protocols, shouldn\u2019t happen because even though it is good cause, it\u2019s already been done twice.

Doesn\u2019t mean she will, either. And for them not to tell her exactly when filming starts is a huge red flag. Johnny\u2019s known for months ahead of time when FB3 was going to start filming. Certainly, if she was going to be in a blockbuster, she\u2019d know when she was supposed to show up to film it so that she could arrange her schedule accordingly.</p>\n<p>Heard went on to slam Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyer, claiming that he\u2019s done all sorts of things that are improper, maybe even illegal, based on social media posts that she doesn\u2019t like.</p>\n<p>I think my favorite line is when she says that she \u201cintends to vindicate herself at trial.\u201d Just like she did in London? Because that was just one big Charlie Foxtrot for her.</p>\n<p>Every day that passes, she insists, provides further opportunity for Depp and Waldman to smear her good name, tarnish her reputation, and irreparably damage her career, which has long been Depp\u2019s stated goal.</p>\n<p>His STATED goal?

The use of fake signatures on these petitions is well outside the skill set of the average internet troll or disgruntled fan. They reflect a concerted effort to damage Ms. Heard. In addition, the change.org petitions were modified to make it appear that far more people signed the petitions than actually did.\"</p>\n<p>She says: \"There are a number of newly created foreign language accounts specifically or predominantly designed to damage Ms. Heard.

To top it off, she\u2019s braless in a sheer dress that clearly shows her nipples.</p>\n<p>She got called out on it from netizens, most of whom found it to be extremely disrespectful for her to appear this way in a place of worship. Muslim commenters found her actions to be unforgivable.</p>\n<p>Amber Heard has struck back. She writes: 'Nope. Apparently whoever paid 4 this to b \u201cwritten\u201d wasnt paid enough.\u00a0'Ill make it easy(ier): Mosques are real places. So are museums &amp; churches. So are head scarfs (where they are sometimes required n order 2 visit). Mystery solved.'</p>\n<p>First, she calls out the reporter for how the article is \u201cwritten\u201d then goes on to babble incoherently herself in gibberish that\u2019s barely legible. She has little room to talk.</p>\n<p>Second, the plural of scarf is scarves. Scarfs is loose slang for when one eats rapidly. And, more importantly, it\u2019s not a simple head scarf. It\u2019s a hijab, which when worn properly has social and religious meaning. She is obviously clueless not just about what it\u2019s called, but what it represents.</p>\n<p>Further, yes. Mosques are real places. They are places of worship which should be treated with respect. That respect does, indeed, require \u201chead scarfs\u201d to be worn, not just as fashion accessories for photo ops, but to be worn properly to show the place and the people the respect they deserve. By refusing to do that, she shows a staggering level of disrespect.</p>\n<p>Her dress is likewise abysmally disrespectful, with her nipples clearly showing through. She was wearing a jacket which she could easily have pulled closed around her chest for modesty. But it\u2019s clear that she has none. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that bohemian attitude on the streets of Soho, perhaps. But in a place of worship where people were praying, a place where modesty is expected, it goes down like a lead balloon.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that her trip to the mosque was nothing more than a photo op. And when she got called on it, she\u2019s completely without remorse. She lashes out like a child at the people that criticized her. She had a chance to learn something and be humble, even apologize, but instead chose to show her true colors. Vindictive and childish.</p>\n<p>I, for one, just can\u2019t wait for the judgement to come down in London, the first nail in her career coffin. Then for the judgement against her in Virginia, which will be the finish of her. Not that she really needs those judgments to finish her off. Word has it that not only is she removed from Aquaman 2, but that she\u2019s also blacklisted. Nobody wants to work with her. And I don\u2019t blame them.

She got out of jail time by agreeing to make a public service announcement about how important the country\u2019s bio-laws are. You can see the cringe-worthy video HERE.</p>\n<p>Now, Barnaby Joyce is demanding that Amber Heard be probed for perjury after allegedly telling an assistant to lie about bringing her two dogs illegally into Australia at the time. <br>Depp's former assistant of eight years,\u00a0Kevin Murphy, said Heard made him lie under oath when they were accused of bringing in the dogs illegally. Mr Murphy claimed Heard told him: 'I want your help on this. I wouldn't want you to have a problem with your job'.

Throughout the course of the trial, with all the evidence being made public every day, there has been an increasing outpouring of support for Johnny Depp, while Amber Heard\u2019s public opinion took a heavy nose dive. People waited outside to give Johnny flowers, while all Amber got was boos. I think Johnny will walk away vindicated, win or lose. The world knows what she did to him, now, and there\u2019s no going back from that.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give the show some credit, though. While they played Amber\u2019s whining about being abused, they did show pictures of Johnny\u2019s actual injuries, albeit fleetingly, and playing the tape where Amber admits to hitting Johnny repeatedly.</p>\n<p>They made repeated use out of that TMZ video, where Johnny was kicking cabinets, as that\u2019s just about the only \u201cevidence\u201d Amber\u2019s team could present that he was ever violent. And I was less than thrilled when it was thrown out there that Johnny might have shat in his own bed and said that he was self-immolating by bringing the libel proceedings.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the show insinuated that both Johnny and Amber are guilty, and that they\u2019re both damaged, no matter who wins.</p>\n<p>What the show seems to forget is that this case isn\u2019t between Johnny and Amber. THIS case is between Johnny Depp and the Sun tabloid. Amber was just a witness. So there\u2019s no way that Amber Heard can win, here. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d claim victory for herself if the Sun prevails, but such really is not the case. Despite her narcissistic need for attention, not everything is about her.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t finish watching the show.

Johnny\u2019s in a grey suit, looking in good spirits ahead of closing arguments on his behalf. Fans had flowers and artwork and chanted \u201cJustice for Johnny!\u201d in support for him. He, in turn, handed out thank you notes and bandanas to the crowd as a thank you for their support throughout this entire ordeal.

It\u2019s not this Depp v Heard drama; that will be settled in Virginia in early 2021. What we\u2019re here for is to decide whether or not the Sun tabloid libeled Johnny Depp when they called him a \u201cwife-beater\u201d on the front cover and continued to portray him as such in the article. That\u2019s it. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.</p>\n<p>The burden of proof, Sherborne said, falls to the Sun to prove that the article was true. And frankly, everything they\u2019ve tried to pull throughout the course of this trial just doesn\u2019t fly. Every accusation of violence save one depends solely upon the fact that Amber Heard says so. They didn\u2019t put forth a shred of evidence that wasn\u2019t easily debunked.</p>\n<p>The one accusation of violence is the \u201cstairs\u201d incident, at which Heard\u2019s sister Whitney was supposedly present. And Whitney is obviously biased. Whether through loyalty to her sister or fear of retaliation, Whitney supported Heard\u2019s version of events, even though that was easily debunked, too. Heard\u2019s own medical history proves that she was never injured. All those doctors and nurses aren\u2019t lying.</p>\n<p>Heard was the abuser in the relationship, Sherborne points out. And Johnny\u2019s not only got physical and medical evidence to support that, he\u2019s got a myriad of witnesses who saw her being violent toward him. And, to top it all off, he\u2019s got Heard on tape confessing to it. That\u2019s pretty cut and dried.</p>\n<p>Over and over throughout the course of the trial, Heard has gotten caught in one lie after the next. She lied about the dogs in Australia, she lied to Homeland security, and she\u2019s lied about every single incident where she claims Johnny Depp abused her. Each and every lie was categorically debunked and exposed. That completely shatters any credibility she had going in, which wasn\u2019t much to begin with.</p>\n<p>Now it goes to the judge, and there\u2019s no telling how long he\u2019ll take to reach a decision. It could be tomorrow, or it could take weeks. Given the complexity and sheer volume of testimony and evidence there is to consider, I think it\u2019ll take some time.

Of major interest, David Sherborne introduced evidence that proved that Whitney was lying when she testified that she did not know her sister to be violent. It\u2019s a transcript of \u00a0a recording - given to his team last night - which shows that Ms\u00a0Henriquez does have knowledge of Heard being violent. So, Boom. Whitney\u2019s testimony is tainted. <br>Earlier in the week, Amber said that she rarely (Never?) goes outside without makeup, but testimony was given today by Amber\u2019s acting coach Kristina Sexton that she rarely wore makeup in the daytime, if ever. And that when she did, it was light. Describing Heard's routine, Ms Sexton says: \"She wore very little. Just foundation, or lip or cheek tint if it was daytime... If it was an evening event, someone would do her make-up for her.\" So, again. Boom.<br>I have a feeling we\u2019re going to see a lot of those today. \u00a0<br>Sexton also shredded other of Amber\u2019s testimony. For example, testifying that she never saw Johnny be violent, but only repeats what Amber said because she has no reason to lie to her. Bitch, please. Amber\u2019s nothing BUT a lie. <br>Ms Laws says that Heard told Ms Sexton: \"Johnny will never let me go, he would rather destroy me than let me go\". Ms Laws asks Ms Sexton if she's aware that while Heard was telling her about the alleged domestic abuse, Heard was also contacting Depp and telling him he could stop the whole divorce process if he wanted. <br>Ms Sexton says she was not aware of this. <br>Ms. Sexton reported that Amber was worried about bad publicity over her split with Depp, because, sure. That\u2019s what any normal woman would be thinking. Of course not. Any survivor of such horrid domestic abuse that she said she suffered at his hands would be relieved to be out of the line of fire.</p>\n<p>Johnny arrived a half-hour late this morning, perhaps due to more meetings about an upcoming role.</p>\n<p>Continuing with Ms. Sexton, she says that on the night of Amber\u2019s 30th birthday party, she was told that Johnny was upstairs, refusing to come down, going so far as to say that Amber and Whitney said they went upstairs to try and get him to come down. Remember, that\u2019s the night that Johnny was late to the party because of a business meeting. He wasn\u2019t upstairs at all. <br>Ms. Sexton is supposed to be Heard\u2019s witness, and does support some aspects of Heard\u2019s story. But, by being honest about things like makeup-gate, she does a fine job of impugning the integrity of Heard\u2019s testimony. <br>The video discussed earlier is finally shown. In it, a woman is talking to Whitney and examining several injuries, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t believe Amber beat you up.\u201d \u00a0<br>Yep. That\u2019s BOOM. Proof that Whitney had knowledge of Amber being violent, and being a victim of that violence herself. Busted. <br>Ms. Wass complains that this evidence, which was submitted only last night, is \u201can ambush\u201d and asks for it to be excluded. But the judge allows the video. <br>Whitney is recalled to the stand. She insists that there was no physical fight between the sisters. It was just the producers trying to make the show more interesting. There are no bruises, she says. The lawyers are looking for injuries that aren\u2019t there. Even though they\u2019re clearly visible. She is so busted it hurts.</p>\n<p>After lunch, Whitney was back in the hot seat, spewing out the same story that Johnny was violent when he wasn\u2019t sober. And with that, she was done.</p>\n<p>The next witness was Raquel (Rocky) Pennington, who confirmed that she lived rent-free in one of Johnny\u2019s penthouses for roughly two years. Can you imagine? Living RENT FREE in an LA penthouse? And then turning around and betraying the guy that paid for it? I can\u2019t. <br>Rocky did confirm that she\u2019s never seen Johnny beat Amber, but insisted that she saw \u201cdeep\u201d gashes on Amber\u2019s arms after Australia and believed Ambers explanation that Johnny did it. She also said that she personally saw all those cuts on Amber\u2019s feet. Ms. Wass suggested that this was a lie, because no cuts existed, but Rocky insists that such was not the case. She says she\u2019s not lying for her friend Amber. <br>Except for insisting that she saw Amber\u2019s cut feet, Rocky\u2019s testimony seems to be toeing the line, saying that all the accounts of Johnny being violent are hearsay, what Amber told her. Not from anything that she witnessed. That actually goes to Johnny\u2019s favor. In fact, throughout her testimony, Rocky seemed a bit wishy-washy, supporting Amber, but leaving a lot of grey area for interpretation. For example, Rocky says that she was best friends with Amber in 2014-2016, but that they aren\u2019t best friends anymore. Just that they \u201cremain close.\u201d That could mean a whole lot, either way. Maybe she was trying to distance herself from Amber so it wouldn\u2019t look like she\u2019d lie for her, or maybe there\u2019s a little bit of trouble in paradise. Like I said, it\u2019s open to interpretation. <br>In the end, Rocky ended up backing Amber, confirming injuries that never happened, like the broken nose and bloody lip Amber says she had before the James Cordon show. When shown photos from the show, Rocky admits that there aren\u2019t any visible injuries, but that her \u201ceyes aren\u2019t that good.\u201d <br>Pitiful. <br>Rocky did trip Amber up a little bit, though, by testifying that Amber was so intoxicated at Coachella that she vomited. Amber earlier testified that she did not vomit at the festival. Woops.</p>\n<p>And, like Ms. Sexton, Rocky didn\u2019t know that Amber was in contact with Johnny trying to get him back. So it looks like Amber was doing some shady things behind her buddies\u2019 backs, while getting them to set the stage for her to frame up Johnny. <br>Rocky contradicted herself when Ms. Wass redirected. She backpedaled about Coachella, saying that she did not see Amber Vomit. Too little too late. The damage is done.</p>\n<p>Up next, iO Tillet-wright. We\u2019ll find out what he did or didn\u2019t know, whether he backs Heard blindly, or if he\u2019s the first to cut and run. <br>Ms Laws, lawyer for Johnny Depp, will be the first to question iO. First up, iO was asked about outing Lily-Rose Depp and using her photo in his project at the time, even though she was only 16 at the time. iO confirms that Johnny wasn\u2019t happy about it. They had a falling out over it and weren\u2019t speaking at the time. But just like everybody else, iO never saw Johnny being violent toward Amber. He only knows what Amber Heard told him. <br>Ms Laws asked about iO slapping Rocky, but the judge put a stop to that. Pity.<br>Ms. Laws ends her questioning after establishing that iO and Rocky competed for Amber\u2019s attention. iO called that an over-simplification, but didn\u2019t dispute it.</p>\n<p>Ms Wass began by asking iO about poopgate, and iO said that Amber couldn\u2019t possibly be responsible for it because she\u2019s poop-phobic and pretends that she doesn\u2019t even poop in private, let alone in somebody\u2019s bed. <br>Wait. Pretends she doesn\u2019t poop? Sure, because that\u2019s SO normal. <br>iO\u2019s account of the Phone-throwing fight is pretty useless, as he was in New York at the time and only heard what Amber wanted him to hear over the phone. All he could really testify to is that he called 911.\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting that iO said the following: \u201cA number of people who worked in the entertainment industry were afraid of speaking up and saying what they had seen as they feared they would be blacklisted.\" Because I firmly believe this to be true, except that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Johnny they were afraid of. Amber has reportedly left a swath of damage in her path of people afraid to speak up against her for fear of blackmail or other retaliation. So I do believe iO snuck the truth in there at the end. Just not overtly.<br>That\u2019s the end of iO\u2019s testimony, and that\u2019s the end of testimony in this case. On Monday, the Sun will submit their closing statement. On Tuesday, Team Johnny will give their closing statement.</p>\n<p>Amber\u2019s team are undoubtedly claiming victory after her buddies testified, but I still think that the case is leaning heavily in Johnny\u2019s favor. I don\u2019t think anything said today really helped Amber at all. If anything, it shot her in the food. That\u2019s my humble opinion, anyway.

We will also be looking at Heard's sixth witness statement, given on 6 July 2020.<br>Amber is wearing black this morning, and her hair is braided at the root, but wavy and loose around her shoulders. She is sipping from a water bottle as she flicks through a large black file of evidence, which in court is referred to as the \"trial bundle.\u201d</p>\n<p>We will be hearing about the painting incident which is alleged to have taken place at one of Depp's many homes, in\u00a0Sweetzer Avenue which is in\u00a0West\u00a0Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Heard explains to the judge that Depp owns several houses at the end of this road. <br>The painting incident was initially said to have occurred on 8 March 2013, after which there was some filming with Rolling Stone Keith Richards. However, in Heard's sixth statement, Heard wrote:\u00a0 \"I have now realized I cannot be sure that the painting incident took place on 8 March 2013.\u201d Heard tells the court she now believes the painting incident actually occurred on 22 March 2013. Heard says there were around three times there was filming with Keith Richards over that month. <br>Depp's lawyer Eleanor Laws QC interrupts at this point, saying this is a very important part of the evidence, and she requests permission from the judge to ask Heard questions about it too. <br>Depp is yet to arrive in court this morning. His lawyer has told us this is because he's in a \"film meeting,\u201d so will be a little late. We are expecting him around midday. This means it's possible he may miss Heard's last morning giving evidence. Depp has been later in court a few times this week, which was also said to be due to \"film meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p>We are now looking at a text exchange between Heard and Depp's assistant Nathan Holmes on 22 March 2013. It begins around noon with Holmes writing: \"On my way to get him.\u201d To which Heard replies: \"Trying to wake him now.\u201d <br>Holmes replies: \"OK. Thank you.\u201d <br>We then fast forward around six hours, and Heard says she has had \"success\" and has got Depp up. <br>Ms. Wass asks what was happening in those six hours. <br>Heard says he was \"snorting cocaine and drinking whisky.\u201d She says they were talking about the relationship and Depp was jealous, believing she was having affairs with several people including her ex-wife, artist Tasya van Ree. <br>Heard says Depp wouldn't leave the subject alone. Heard describes Depp as being on \"a bender\" at this stage. She says she reached out to friends and her mother at the time. <br>There is another text exchange between Mr. Holmes and Heard in which Heard asks: \"Is he alright? Still upright?\u201d <br>Mr. Holmes answers: \"Yes, OK. He's still upright.\" <br>Heard says she asked this as Depp had been taking cocaine and drinking for around 36 hours, and at that point she wasn't used to \"his patterns,\u201d so was worried about his health. She says she wanted to check he was \"still alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>We look at a text exchange between Heard and her mother Paige Parsons who died in May of this year. Heard's text to her mum says: \"Dealing with Johnny's spiral. It's terrible mom. I don't know what to do\" and goes on to say \"He's nuts mom. Violent and crazy. I am heartbroken that THIS is who I love.\u201d Her mother says she should tell her father, David. <br>But Heard texts back to say \"I can't tell Dad.\u201d Heard says she trusted her mother, but didn't know whether her \"dad would react violently.\u201d Heard clarifies she means violently towards Depp. <br>A later text to her mother says: \"My heart is broken. I'm OK physically. JD didn't hit me or anything last\u00a0night. I told him that would be it if he did and it worked last night. But I'm scared by what I see and who I see now. It's Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde -- on a binge. He's not violent to me\" (talking about Depp). <br>Heard tells Ms. Wass she sent this text to her mother as she had sent pictures of her of her bruises pictures to her mother, but didn't want her father to react badly. <br>Heard also sent another text in which she says there was no physical abuse, writing: \"It's OK Mom. He's not being violent with me. He's just even raging in general.\u00a0And the crazy mood swings and binges are really difficult for me to handle.\" She tells Ms. Wass she knew about that first hand as: \"My father was like this to my mother growing up.\u201d Heard sounds emotional as she explains to Ms. Wass what she meant by a text she sent to her mother saying: \"I feel like I'm on a very fast train that's about to explode but I don't want to jump off and leave my love behind . So I stay on the train, even though I know it's about to explode.\"<br>She goes on to describe what she says are two distinct parts to Depp's personality. She says when he was sober, he was: \"Generous, loving, a remarkable man when he's like that... The other side of him is a monster. I always held out hope he would get clean and sober.\u201d <br>Heard again clarifies that in texts where she told her mother Depp didn't hit her, she was simply trying to stop her father from finding out about the alleged domestic violence. <br>Heard describes her father David to the court, saying: \"He's an addict and an alcoholic, and very violent, but I loved him very much.\u201d <br>In a text to her mother, referring to Depp, Heard says: \"He makes dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon.\u201d <br>Heard says over this period Depp had stayed at her house for weeks. She says: \"I couldn't get a moments sleep, I was either defending myself or trying to keep him happy... I don't know how it got so violent so fast.\" <br>Heard says at one point, she was so exhausted she \"accidentally on purpose\" locked the dead-bolts to keep Depp out of her house, and says she had the best night's sleep she'd had in ages. She texted her mother to say she'd done this. <br>Heard's mother replies: \"Oh my baby, has he stayed this way since then?.\u201d Her mum then asks what Depp's bodyguards are doing about it all.</p>\n<p>We are now talking about Heard's sister Whitney\u00a0Henriquez. In Whitney's first statement, she says Heard told her Depp had \"defaced\" Tasya van Ree's painting, altering the signature to make it read \"Tasya van Pee.\u201d Ms. Laws is saying this is a \"detail to add into their [Heard and Whitney's] constructed account,\u201d and that Depp's act was actually a \"lighthearted joke\" between all-three, then used as evidence in a bid to show Depp in a bad light.<br>There is now some faff in court as everyone searches for a picture. Possibly of some flamingos. No one seeMs. quite sure. <br>Okay, there is a painting of some flamingos, but it's not the one we're talking about. <br>The court is looking at a picture, which is said to include some bags and squares (unfortunately I can't see it to be more specific), and which Heard says was damaged by Depp. Heard says after it was damaged, it was put in the garage. <br>Ms. Laws says talking about this painting has reminded her that \"Mr. Depp was not asked about this painting at all.\u201d She is not very happy about this, and says this topic has come up after Depp's stint in the witness box. Earlier this week Heard said Depp had damaged many paintings during their relationship, hence this slight confusion over exactly which art-work we're talking about.<br>Ms. Wass asks: \"Are any of these paintings the one that Mr. Depp asked you to remove from your bedroom.\u201d <br>Heard answers: \"Yes, it's the one there, that's now sitting in my garage.\u201d <br>The judge is asking for clarification as to which painting she means. <br>\"It's the one with flamingos, and it's always been that one,\u201d Heard answers. <br>Ms. Wass asks \"What damage, if any, was there to the painting?\" However, before Heard can answer there is some debate between Ms. Laws and Ms. Wass over whether this question is leading the witness. <br>The judge eventually rules Heard can answer. <br>Heard says: \"This is the painting he tried to burn. He tried to burn it when I objected to taking it down.\u201d Heard says the picture is damaged on the back from this attempted burning.</p>\n<p>Now we are moving on to the \"three-day hostage situation\" which is alleged to have taken place in March 2015. First, Ms. Wass asks Heard if she knew about texts between Depp and his assistant Mr. Holmes, dubbed the \"drug texts.\u201d These got Depp into hot water ahead of the trial, when the judge found he was in breach of court for not disclosing the texts to The Sun's lawyers. <br>Heard says she had not been previously aware of these texts.<br>We are looking at texts describing the alleged damage to the house the couple were renting in Australia at the time of the alleged incident. Alleged damage includes broken glass, graffiti on mirrors and broken surfaces. <br>Ms. Wass asks Heard if she was responsible for any of the damage. <br>Heard replies: \"I broke a bottle, that is all.\u201d<br>We now hear a quote from Depp's late head of security, Jerry Judge, in which he says an artwork in the house had been defaced and a penis had been drawn on to a painting of a woman. <br>Ms. Wass reads out the extract from Mr. Judge's statement: \"There are two pictures here standing, very sexy. One in a bikini, standing with her hands on her breasts. What he did was paint a fake d*ck on her p****.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws is objecting to this questioning, not just because it is rather ripe, but because she says the witness is being asked to describe not just what she saw, but also what others saw. <br>Ms. Wass says it shows the \"global destruction\" going on and the \"derangement of Mr. Depp's mind\" at the time, which she says Heard is being made out to have fabricated. <br>Ms. Wass re-frames the question, and we continue.</p>\n<p>Heard now describes the scene she says she was met with on entering the house: \"There was mashed potato and gravy smeared on the door outside. <br>\"There was\u00a0 bird in the house. It scared me to death when entered room. It must have flown in window. There was blood everywhere. I thought it was from my feet but it wasn't. I thought it was paint, a kind of brownish color, on the walls. It was dark brown at first, then lightened out to a milky brown colour.\" She says the writing which was \"all the way down the stairs and stairwell\" was letters, and she could make out some words written in English. She says there was \"blood on the walls, on lampshades and everywhere with written messages.\u201d <br>She continues: \"He had burned though cushions and lampshades... There was a couch flipped over. It appeared he had set fire to one of the cushions because the couch was burned around it.\" <br>Upstairs in the bedroom level Heard says: \"There was a broken window... My paints were out, it appears to be he had either thrown or dropped paint on the floor and on the wall. There was both paint and blood, I could see textures. <br>\"I found raw meat, at first I didn't know what it was on the floor. I continued to find it for the next day hidden in various places. <br>\"He had taken my nightgown and wrapped it around pieces of food. It was food I had got food out the night before, but not got round to\u00a0 making it. <br>\"I could see my own bloody footprints, and what appeared to be dripping blood. \"I made it downstairs and there was death metal blasting out. There was blood and glass everywhere, and the tiles floor was still wet. There were windows broken. There was so much glass I could barely find a path to walk. The ping pong table was broken and on the ground.\"<br>Ms. Wass asks if Heard threw a bottle and damaged Depp's finger. Heard says no. She says: \"It occurred about 24-hours into his binge, his rage.\u201d She says it was after \"he held me up against the fridge and said over and over again that he wished he had never met me and I'd ruined his life. he said I made him drink and I always did this.\" She goes on: \"He held a bottle up to my face and said he'd cut me. At some point I pushed him, and tried to push his arMs. away.\" <br>Heard tells the court Depp damaged his finger when he repeatedly punched the wall with a cream Bakelite phone, which she says smashed into many pieces. She says at the time she didn't realise that was when he cut his finger, but that is when she believes it happened. Heard describes Depp as being \"out of his mind\" at the time of the alleged incident.</p>\n<p>The court took a short break.<br>Ms. Wass has been reminded by the judge that she must finish her questioning by lunch time, as Heard's sister Whitney is due to enter the witness box this afternoon.</p>\n<p>Heard is standing in the witness box waiting to resume giving evidence. She has three bottles of water next to her and is putting some sanitizing gel on her hands.</p>\n<p>We are talking about an alleged domestic violence incident, when Heard says Depp pulled her by the hair and punched her in the face in March 2015. <br>At this time Heard's sister, Whitney, was also said to be there at the time. This was referred to in court yesterday as the \"staircase incident.\u201d <br>Depp was wearing a hard plaster cast on his hand at the time, following the incident in Australia. Heard later returned to Australia with Depp the following month, and to the same house, after the March 2015 incident. <br>Ms. Heard begins to answer: \"I lived in many houses, and I was assaulted many times.\" <br>Ms. Wass asks why she returned to the house in Australia. <br>Heard answers: \"I was used to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>We now look at a text from the late Jerry Judge on 26 April 2015. <br>This was five days after Heard and Depp's return to Australia (with their dogs Pistol and Boo).<br>\"Hi boss... It's lovely to see how you and Amber are so happy. Seeing you sitting on that bench together yesterday... You two need happiness.\u201d Heard says Depp wasn't drinking or taking drugs at the time.<br>We are talking about the couple's return to Australia to complete Depp's filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean. This was the occasion when the dogs were illegally \"smuggled\" into the country, creating a bio hazard threat. <br>However, at this point it seeMs. the judge has heard enough about the dogs, and says he has already listened to plenty of evidence on this.</p>\n<p>We move on to more specific questioning about the forMs. that were filled out ahead of the dogs entering the country. At the time, Heard pleaded guilty to illegally bringing them into the country, despite saying she was not responsible for filling out the forMs. and had believed the dogs had had the correct shots to travel.</p>\n<p>We will now see a transcript of a recording, which Ms. Wass says was captured on 26 September 2015. The couple had a practice of recording arguments early on in their relationship, in an attempt to learn from them and come to a constructive conclusion. Later in the relationship covert recordings of arguments were also captured. Both types of recording are being heard as evidence in the case. The recording took place after the couple's honeymoon trip to South East Asia, which was in July 2015. In the conversation, Depp talks about their honeymoon, saying it was good apart from one argument in San Francisco. <br>He also talks about their arguments and says: \"There can be no physical violence towards each other.\u201d He says when they fall out, they need to physically separate from each other in order to cool off and avoid conflict. He goes on to say otherwise we will \"f***ing kill each other, or worse you know, f***ing break up.\u201d <br>Depp's lawyer, Ms. Laws, is again saying there is an issue here - that these questions have not been put to Depp so \"there is no evidential basis\" for the questions to Heard. The judge upholds this, and we move on.</p>\n<p>We return to the days leading up to Heard's appearance on the James Corden Late Late show on 16 December 2015. <br>Ms. Wass is reminding us Heard has been accused of making the injuries up, and also of photo shopping images. <br>Heard says she did not. She also says she put no make-up on to make injuries appear worse, adding \"I put make up on only to try to hide them [the injuries].\u201d <br>There were also images of a broken bed in penthouse 4 supplied. Heard says yes, and she did not damage the bed. <br>Images of clumps of hair were also pictured on the floor. <br>Head says she did not pull out her own hair, and nor did she ask anyone else to pull out her hair. <br>During the fight on 12 December, Heard also alleges that Depp headbutted her. <br>We are talking about a recording of an argument between Depp and Heard that was taken around July 2016, which mentions a headbutt. In it you can hear Depp saying: \"I headbutted you... in the forehead. That doesn't break a nose.\u201d <br>Ms. Wass asks Heard at what point she realised there was a recording in which Depp mentioned a headbutt, but the judge tells her to move on.</p>\n<p>We move on to a visit from\u00a0nurse,\u00a0Erin\u00a0Boerum to Heard on\u00a017 December 2015.</p>\n<p>Heard says: \"She was just dropping off meds, and she was late.\u201d</p>\n<p>We move on to Heard and Depp travelling to the Bahamas with his children in 2014. However, now again, Ms. Laws interrupts and we move on.</p>\n<p>We watch a video, showing the inside of the house in the Bahamas. The person filming the video is walking towards a beaded curtain on a doorway, and the bathroom is apparently through the curtain and to the left. <br>Heard has alleged she was abused inside the closet, and from the inside of the bathroom, inside the door. <br>The video goes on to show the closet, and a bed, and pan around the room. We can hear no more on this subject, as we are now veering towards parts of the hearing that need to be held in private. <br>Parts of Heard's evidence, relating to allegations of sexual violence, have been heard in private, with the media excluded from the proceedings.</p>\n<p>We move on to just after Heard's 30th birthday, and a photo that was taken on 23 April 2016. Heard says it was taken at the Coachella Festival. Heard names her friends in the picture left to right: Romi Serafy, herself, Whitney, Melanie Inglessis,\u00a0iO Tillet Wright, and\u00a0Savannah McMillan. <br>She nearly forgets her final friend's name, and laughs as she stumbles to find the name. <br>Ms. Wass puts it to Heard that she has been accused of \"painting on injuries\" that can be seen in photos now being shown to the court. This was alleged to be from photos taken during the last big alleged argument between Depp and Heard on 21 May 2016. The photo metadata shows it was taken at 8.23pm before the police arrived later that evening. <br>Heard says she neither put on make up to enhance nor create the appearance of injures, and says she also didn't want to talk to the police. <br>Ms. Wass says it was also suggested to Heard that her and her friends - including neighbor Rocky Pennington - trashed the penthouse and said it was Depp who had done it in order to frame him. <br>Heard says no, this is not the case.</p>\n<p>We are now watching CCTV video taken in the LA penthouse apartment block, taken on 22 May 2016. It shows Heard entering the lift, while texting on her phone. She then gets out of the lift. <br>Heard returns to the lift a few minutes later holding packages. Heard says she then went to her car. She says her first engagement that day was going to her friend Rocky's beach house.<br>We are looking at a photo taken at 13.58 on the same day. The picture shows Heard on the left of the photo, and Ms. Wass asks her if she was wearing make-up on that occasion. <br>\"Yes, I was [wearing make-up]. Absolutely.\u201d <br>Ms. Wass asks: \"Do you ever go out of the house without make-up.\u201d <br>Heard laughs, and says: \"No, I live in LA.\u201d <br>The judge asks for clarification on why this is.<br>Heard answers: \"I'm recognizable, or a celebrity or whatever you want to call it. So I never go out of the house without make up in case I'm photographed.\u201d<br>After going to the beach house, Heard says \"I went to my friend Amanda's birthday party.\u201d She clarifies that this is the British presenter Amanda de Cadenet.<br>Ms. Wass reads out a text from de Cadenet which advises Heard to \"put arnica on it.\u201d <br>Heard explains that arnica is a homeopathic remedy which is said to alleviate bruises and swelling. <br>The judge isn't keen for us to dwell on this topic, so we move on.</p>\n<p>We move on to details around 21 April and 21 May incidents (around Heard's birthday and the alleged final argument in LA, when a phone was said to have been thrown by Depp at Heard). <br>We are discussing Heard meeting with Depp near the end of their relationship.<br>Heard says the understanding was that Depp's security and others would always be \"in shouting distance\" of the couple. Heard says she didn't trust Depp's staff to step in and help her, so she always wanted others to be nearby too. <br>Ms. Wass is keen to know exactly how Heard felt about meeting with Depp, but the judge says no, this is a leading question.<br>We talk about the details of the domestic abuse becoming public knowledge.<br>Heard says \"I didn't want to talk about everything that happened in our marriage or relationship. I didn't want the world or his kids to know who he was, and what he could do.\"<br>Earlier this week Heard told Depp's lawyer: \"I was trying to save him the embarrassment and this, quite frankly.\u201d<br>Heard now clarifies, and says she was talking about the current court case when she said \"and this,\u201d adding \"I meant no offence to these proceedings.\u201d<br>Ms. Wass asks if her career has benefited from the case.<br>Heard answers: \"What women has ever benefited from being the victim of domestic violence?\"<br>Ms. Wass asks if she has benefited financially.<br>Heard says: \"No. I entered into he marriage without a\u00a0 pre or post-nuptial agreement in a no-fault state. I was entitled to 50% .\" <br>Ms. Wass's final question is: \"Have you told the truth to this court?\" <br>Heard answers: \"Absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, Heard has finished giving evidence. She steps down from the witness box. <br>The judge reminds her not to talk to any other witnesses during the case. <br>Heard's sister, Whitney, is due to enter the witness box this afternoon.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to give a blow-by-blow accounting of Whitney\u2019s testimony like I did with Amber\u2019s. I think it\u2019s safe to say that she\u2019ll back her sister up on everything. It would be a real shocker if she didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually going to call it here. I\u2019ll post the link to the transcript when it becomes available, but quite honestly, I can\u2019t sit here and listen to this nonsense.

Laws is asking if Depp was trying to get away from Heard. <br>The actress disagrees. <br>The QC asks if Heard was in a rage - again, she disagrees. <br>Heard is now being asked if she threw a bottle at Depp - again, she disagrees. <br>Ms.. Laws puts it to her that she would throw things at Depp during fights, to which Heard replies. \"I only threw things to escape Johnny when he was beating me up. Sometimes that's all I had.\"<br>Ms.. Laws is saying Heard threw a bottle \"forcefully\" at Depp in Australia. <br>Heard says no, that it was Depp who was throwing bottles. <br>Heard says at one point, Depp offered her a bottle. She says she reached to take it and the actor pulled it back, that he was \"taunting me to take it.\u201d <br>She continues: \"He did it again.\"</p>\n<p>Heard says she was thinking about previous occasions when Depp had told her she had \"saved his life\" by helping him stop drinking. She says at that point she smashed the bottle on the floor. <br>She says she regrets doing this.</p>\n<p>Depp then started throwing bottles \"one after the other, right in my direction\", she says. \"I felt glass breaking behind me. I retreated more... he didn't stop. \"I was too scared to look behind me.\" <br>The judge asks her to clarify if Depp threw several bottles. The actress says he threw all the bottles there apart from one. <br>\"When he was clean and sober he would tell me I saved his life,\" Heard is telling the court. \"When he was clean and sober he was wonderful, that part of him I loved so much.\" Everyone around him wanted him \"to be well\" and for him to \"get help\", she says.</p>\n<p>Heard is being asked to look at a file now, containing a photograph. <br>The actress says: \"I would be shocked if Johnny remembers any of this hiMs..elf. \" <br>Ms.. Laws interrupts, saying she wants to know about an injury to Depp - we have heard a lot already about how he wounded his finger in Australia. <br>The question Ms.. Laws wants an answer to is that it was \"inconceivable\" that Depp injured hiMs..elf smashing a phone against a wall, the judge tells Heard. <br>The actress disagrees. <br>Depp has accused Heard of throwing a bottle at him, causing the injury. She denies this. <br>She is now being asked about a cigarette burn on Depp's cheek, shown in a photograph. \"Johnny did that,\" Heard says. \"He often did things like that.\" <br>Heard denies that it was she who was being violent. <br>Heard is now being asked if it is true that at one stage she was screaming at Depp not to leave and then calling him a \"coward.\u201d <br>She says this is not true.</p>\n<p>Ms.. Laws is now asking about Heard's evidence yesterday, moving on from the Australia incident. <br>The court is being played some audio. We can hear a woman's voice but it's pretty quiet (remember, we are in a different courtroom to where the trial is taking place, watching on screen). <br>Now a man's voice. Ms.. Laws says this is a conversation between Heard and Depp.<br>\"Sometimes I lose my cool when I get angry,\" Heard says in court, when asked by Ms.. Laws.</p>\n<p>Ms.. Laws is now moving on to a different Australia incident, when Heard and Depp infamously took their dogs, Yorkshire Terriers Pistol and Boo, into the country. <br>\"It was made quite clear to you... that you couldn't take the dogs into Australia,\" Ms.. Laws is saying to Heard. The actress says she received mixed messages. <br>The court has previously heard evidence from Kevin Murphy, who worked for Depp for almost eight years - he alleged Heard \"demanded\" he make a false statement about the animals being \"smuggled\" into the country. <br>He also claimed Ms.. Heard asked him to contact her former assistant, Kate James, and ask her to \"lie under oath\" to an Australian court about the incident. <br>Mr. Murphy said the actress was \"repeatedly\" told it would be illegal for her to take her two dogs with her to the country. <br>In October 2015, Heard faced criminal proceedings in Australia over the incident. In 2016 she and Depp recorded a now infamous video in 2016 apologizing for doing so.<br>Ms.. Laws is now reading out an email from Mr. Murphy, in which it seeMs.. he is making it clear that the dogs would not be able to travel at the time they wanted to go due to restrictions. <br>Heard says the process went on for a while and was confusing. <br>Speaking about Depp, she says she was travelling on \"his plane\" for \"his movie\" and she thought it had been \"taken care of.\u201d <br>Ms.. Laws said it was laid out in \"black and white\" and that Heard took the decision. <br>\"Johnny's the boss,\" Heard says. She says he called the shots. <br>\"You got caught,\" Ms.. Laws says. Heard says they both flew in, yet she was the one who got into trouble. She said anything against Depp would have \"compromised Pirates [of the Caribbean]\", which the actor was filming in the country. <br>Heard tells the court: \"I took the blame.\"</p>\n<p>The judge wants to ask Heard about the charge she faced. Was it for bringing a dog into Australia although she had said \"in some form or other\" that she wasn't bringing a dog into the country? <br>Heard says both she and Depp filled out forMs.. but that because filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean had already been compromised by the earlier incident in Australia (when Depp wounded his finger), she took the blame. <br>Ms.. Laws tells Heard knew she was taking the dogs in without the proper paperwork. <br>Heard says no, she thought they did have the correct paperwork. <br>Ms.. Laws is suggesting that Heard was trying to find someone to take the blame for her. <br>She says no and that she had already pleaded guilty. <br>Ms.. Laws is saying that Heard wanted her former assistant Kate James to lie in a statement about the dogs. <br>Heard says this is incorrect. The actress says she only wanted to show that they had tried to follow protocol.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of back and forth about the dogs now. Heard is taking a sip from her water bottle. <br>\"Trying to get around official rules is something you've done before,\" Ms.. Laws says. Heard says she doesn't know what the QC means. <br>She says Depp thought things were \"easy\" to take care of in \"his world.\u201d <br>She says she was not in a relationship in which she had \"a lot of choice.\u201d <br>Ms.. Laws puts it to Heard that she blames Depp for things she is accused of. She says this is not the case.</p>\n<p>We are now moving on to a different alleged incident, during the couple's honeymoon in July 2015 on a train in southeast Asia. <br>Heard is being shown a photograph in which Depp is apparently injured (we cannot see the photographs they are shown in court). <br>Ms.. Laws says Heard has turned the incident around. The actress denies this. \"He strangled me,\" she tells the court.</p>\n<p>Ms.. Laws is now directing Heard to her own account of what took place in a different alleged incident - we have moved on quickly - during which she claiMs.. Depp headbutted her at their penthouse apartment in LA. <br>The QC is reading out the actress's allegations, in which she claiMs.. he punched her and dragged her. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is a \"complete set of lies\"; Heard quietly says no. <br>The actress asks for a break \"whenever is convenient.\u201d <br>Ms.. Laws says she wants to finish her point and then we can have a break. <br>Ms.. Laws is talking about nurse Erin Boerum's account of the incident. <br>\"You didn't have any bruising at all when you saw Erin Boerum, did you?\" Ms.. Laws says. <br>Heard says she had two black eyes, a broken nose, a \"broken lip\", bruised ribs, \"bruises all over my body.\u201d <br>She says the \"really bad [bruises]\" were on her scalp. There were chunks of hair missing, she says, and it sounds like she is getting upset. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is \"nonsense.\u201d Heard disagrees. <br>The QC asks if she bit her own lip. \"Of course not,\" Heard replies.</p>\n<p>After a 10 minute break, Amber Heard gets back in the witness box. She is being directed to a new file by Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp. <br>Heard is looking at a photo of her alleged injuries and is being asked if she \"played around\" with the images. <br>\"I don't know how to,\" Heard replies.<br>This is from December 2015; the next day the actress recorded for James Corden's show. <br>Ms.. Laws is being asked if this is what she looked like on the show - as in, did she look like she does in the photo.<br>Heard says she had her hair and make-up done at home. <br>Ms.. Laws has asked about stylist Samantha McMillen, who saw Heard on that day.<br>Heard says Ms.. McMillen saw her while her make-up was being done. <br>Ms.. McMillen is Depp's stylist, Heard says, but also worked as her stylist while they were a couple. She says it is not true that Ms.. McMillen saw her without make-up on. <br>Ms.. McMillen, who has already given evidence in court, says she saw \"no visible\" injuries the day after Heard claiMs.. Depp was violent. <br>The stylist says she spent \"much of the afternoon and early evening\" with Heard on 16 December 2015, as the star prepared to appear on James Corden's The Late Late Show, and she could \"see clearly\" that Heard had no marks, cuts or bruises. <br>Heard is being asked to look at a picture of Depp and says she can see no mark. <br>She denies injuring him, saying: \"I don't know how I could have.\" <br>Heard is now being directed to another photograph, which Ms.. Laws says is of hair Heard alleges was pulled out. <br>Ms.. Laws is suggesting this has been set up, that her hair would have come out at the root. <br>Heard is asked why she took a photo of her scalp if her hair did not break at the root. The actress says her scalp was bleeding. <br>She says this photograph shows just one of many clumps of hair that were pulled out.</p>\n<p>We are now being shown a short clip of Heard on Corden's show. <br>The actress confirMs.. it is her. <br>She has bright red lipstick on and is wearing a cream blouse and black tie. <br>\"That's what you looked like on the show,\" Ms.. Laws says, and says there is no injury. Heard says she had \"tons of injuries.\u201d <br>Ms.. Laws is now talking about a still taken from footage from the show. She says the actress does not have a split lip. <br>The actress says the reason she wore the red lipstick and make-up is to \"cover\" injuries.</p>\n<p>We are now going back to Heard's first allegation of violence against Depp, in early 2013. <br>The couple had moved in together the previous year.<br>In her witness statement, Heard says: \"We were talking about one of his tattoos, which he had had altered from Winona (his ex-partner) to say 'Wino'. I laughed at something he said but he must not have meant it as a joke and he hit me with an open hand across my cheek.\" <br>Later in her statement, she says: \"It felt like my eye popped out.\"<br>Ms.. Laws asks if Heard is making this up. Heard says she does not agree.</p>\n<p><br>Ms.. Laws has moved on again, to an alleged incident in the Bahamas in August 2014. The QC reads from Heard's statement again, in which the actress alleges that Depp grabbed her hair and slapped her. <br>\"He was in such a rage that he smashed a door so hard that it splintered,\" she says in her statement.<br>Ms.. Laws is directing Heard to a photograph, and says \"this is not a door from the Bahamas, is it?\" <br>Heard admits it is not but that it was a different door he kicked. <br>Ms.. Laws says Amber has submitted evidence in a \"cavalier\" way. Heard says it was an error. <br>We are now watching a very short clip, with no sound, of the inside of the property in the Bahamas. Heard confirMs.. that it is.</p>\n<p>Moving on again, to a trip to Tokyo in January 2015, the month before the couple got married. <br>Heard tells the court she attended a premiere there about two days after Depp was allegedly violent. She says she remembers wearing a backless dress to the event \"very well.\u201d She tells the court her injuries were \"not visible.\u201d</p>\n<p>And now to Thanksgiving, November 2015 - we're moving between allegations quite speedily now. <br>In Heard's statement, she says: \"We were in our place in LA. Johnny was using a lot of drugs at the time, especially cocaine and weed, which he was pretty much constantly smoking. \"We got into a fight on Thanksgiving, where Johnny ripped my shirt and threw me across the room. He threw a wine glass and a heavy glass decanter at me, which thankfully both missed me. Once when he pushed me, I fell over the back of a lounge chair and hit my head against the apartment\u2019s exposed brick wall. I noticed later that I had got a lump on the back of my head and a busted lip from this.\" <br>Ms.. Laws asks if this is all true. \"Yes, it is,\" Heard replies.</p>\n<p>Ms.. Laws has directed Heard to a file and the court is going to be shown a video clip. The footage is very dark; the actress says she can barely see it (neither can we) when asked to confirm where the footage was recorded. <br>She says it looks like one of Depp's penthouses in LA but \"cannot tell\" which one. <br>There are a few people in the clip, including a man flicking a scarf - Heard confirMs.. this is her father, David. Jack, Depp's son, is also there, Heard says. \u201cI believe I hear Marilyn Manson's voice,\" Heard says. <br>Ms.. Laws says everyone is \"joking around\" in the video, and it does sound like people are laughing.<br>Heard is being directed to a photograph; Ms.. Laws asks if it was taken after she received a \"split lip.\u201d <br>The actress says the alleged injury happened after the photo was taken, and that fights with Depp happened after other people had \"gone home\" or \"gone to bed.\u201d <br>Ms.. Laws asks about Heard's friend, Raquel 'Rocky' Pennington, who the actress says she cannot identify in the video (as it's so dark) but confirMs.. she was there.<br>Ms.. Laws is reading from Ms.. Pennington's account. <br>Rocky says that at one point Heard went upstairs to find Depp and they were gone for some period. Ms.. Pennington says Heard told her Depp had thrown a bottle of wine at her, the court hears.<br>Ms.. Laws puts it to Heard that this means the fight took place while others were there - contradicting what she has previously said. <br>Heard says this was just the first \"part\" of the argument.<br>The judge is saying he would find it helpful to have a plan of Depp's penthouses to get more of a sense of where alleged incidents took place - the court is hearing about penthouse five and penthouse three. <br>Erin Boerum, a nurse who treated both Ms.. Heard and Johnny Depp during their relationship, was there on the night of the alleged incident. <br>Heard says she was downstairs during \"part\" of the incident but not later on. <br>\"It got much worse later,\" Heard tells the court. <br>Ms.. Laws says this is a \"lie.\" <br>Heard replies: \"No, Ma'am.\"<br>We are waiting to see a video clip, I think it is, but it appears there are some technical difficulties. <br>Ms.. Laws says she is going to move on.</p>\n<p>This part of Heard\u2019s testimony is given in private, with the media and public briefly excluded from the proceedings.</p>\n<p>On the heels of Heard\u2019s private testimony, the court adjourns for lunch.</p>\n<p>Back in court after lunch, there has been some discussion about the trial timetable as Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, has not finished cross-examining Heard. <br>However, the judge has decided we will hear from Joshua Drew, via video-link from LA, first, and he is now giving his affirmation. At the moment, we can hear him but can't see him on the screen in the media room. <br>Mr. Drew is the ex-fiance of\u00a0Raquel \"Rocky\" Pennington, Heard's friend, and he is being asked about the night of 21 April 2016 - Amber Heard's 30th birthday party.</p>\n<p>Mr. Drew agrees with Ms. Laws that Depp was \"coherent\" and \"friendly.\u201d He says his perception was that Depp was \"slightly inebriated.\u201d Mr. Drew's perception was that it was a \"fun\" evening, he says. <br>Ms. Laws is asking Mr. Drew if a lot of the information he had about Depp and Heard's relationship came from Ms. Pennington. <br>Mr. Drew says this is correct and confirMs. he never saw the actor hitting Heard. He says he saw rows between them \"on rare occasions.\u201d <br>(We can see Mr. Drew on the screen now, by the way. He has a beard and glasses and is wearing a grey jacket and a blue shirt.<br>Ms. Laws asks Mr. Drew if he ever saw Heard drink to \"excess\" or taking drugs. He says yes to the drinking and that he has seen Heard take drugs, including mushrooMs., on rare occasions. <br>Ms. Laws is directing Mr. Drew to a deposition he has given.<br>Ms. Laws is now moving on to 21 May 2016, the final alleged incident of violence before Depp and Heard's break-up. <br>Ms.. Laws says Mr. Drew and Ms. Pennington got involved in supporting Heard and lying afterwards. <br>He does not agree. <br>Asked if he saw an assault, he says: \"I did not, as I have stated repeatedly.\" <br>Asked if Heard had an injury, he says she did. <br>Ms. Laws says she has no further questions.<br>Sasha Wass, representing NGN, wants to clarify on Heard's drug use. <br>Mr. Drew confirMs. he has never seen the actress take cocaine. <br>Ms. Wass is saying to Mr. Drew that it's being suggested that Heard was not injured when he saw her following the alleged incident in LA in May 2016. <br>Ms. Wass is directing him to a photograph of Heard, which he confirMs. he can see. <br>She then directs him to metadata attached to the photograph, but the judge cuts this short. <br>Asked by Ms. Wass, Mr. Drew says he was present when photos were taken and when police arrived at the property. <br>He says he was present when photographs of damage in the property was taken. <br>Mr. Drew is being asked to describe a print-out of a photograph but he says he cannot see it as it's too dark.<br>He is being directed to another, but he says this is just as dark. <br>Ms. Wass asks if photos can be shown on screen instead.

This was penthouse one. <br>\u201cIn penthouse three there was broken glass\", he says. \u201cIn penthouse five there was a variety of things that had been thrown about.\u201d He says there was glass from a broken picture frame on the floor and piles of books that had been \"shoved around.\u201d <br>Ms. Wass asks if Mr. Drew took photographs and he says he believes he did. <br>Did he see how the damage was caused? <br>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. He also says he did not cause the damage. <br>Ms. Wass asks what he recalls about his interaction with the police. <br>Mr. Drew says his initial recollection is not completely clear \"after all these years\" but he says he greeted the officers and \"walked them through the damage myself.\u201d<br>The witness says he took them back to penthouse three, where Heard was, and the female officer said she wanted to speak to the actress privately. <br>The witness says he stayed outside with the male officer and asked \"what we could do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Drew has now finished giving evidence and again, there is some legal argument about the time being taken.

She says she has met Johnny Depp and seen him about \"five or six times.\u201d She says interactions with Depp were \"lovely.\u201d<br>Asked if she spoke to Heard about her relationship, she says they had \"many\" conversations \"about her relationship with Johnny.\u201d</p>\n<p>Our source has decided to cut out the xe by Ms. Laws and go straight to the redirect by Ms.. Wass. But fear not, the full transcripts will be posted later by the ever-reliable Nick Wallis. You can read the whole thing, then. I know I will.</p>\n<p><br>Ms. Inglessis is being asked by Ms. Wass about the restraining order filed by Heard after her break-up with Depp. <br>The witness says it was not out of the blue to her. <br>Ms. Wass asks about 15 December 2015, the day before Heard recorded James Corden's show. \"Can you tell us what you saw of Amber's face on that day?\" <br>Ms. Inglessis says she was supposed to go bowling with Heard and she never showed up. She says Heard sent a text later on saying she had had a fight with Depp; Ms. Inglessis says she went to their penthouse and saw broken glass on the floor and damage to the bed upstairs, as well as writing on the kitchen worktop. <br>Ms. Wass asks about Heard's condition. Ms. Inglessis says she was \"erratic\", \"upset\" and there was \"a lot of emotion.\u201d <br>The witness says Heard told her she and Depp had had a fight and that the actor had tried to suffocate her with a pillow and dragged her by her hair. <br>Ms. Inglessis tells the court she had to do Heard's make-up the following day, for Corden's show. The witness says Heard had \"discoloration\" near her eyes, that her left eye was a little more bruised than the right eye. The bridge of Heard's nose was red and swollen, she says, and Heard had a cut or scab on her lip. <br>Ms. Wass asks what they talked about while Ms. Inglessis was doing Heard's make-up. <br>She says they talked about the incident the night before, that the actress told her how her alleged injuries happened. <br>The witness says she applied a full face of make-up and that although it was not uncommon for Heard to wear full red lipstick, she remembers that the discussion that day was that she had no other choice because she needed to cover an injury on her lip. <br>Ms. Wass asks how effective concealer is; Ms. Inglessis says it is \"very effective\" on bruises and that they were no longer visible once her make-up had been applied. <br>Heard said 15 December 2015 was one of the worst\u00a0\"one of the worst and most violent nights\" of their relationship, with Depp throwing a decanter at her, slapping her and dragging her by her hair around their penthouse before headbutting her and saying he would kill her. <br>The next day she was due on The Late Show with James Corden, which Joshua Drew, the then partner of her friend Raquel \"Rocky\" Pennington, said Heard told them she could not drop out of.</p>\n<p>After a few questions from Ms. Laws, Ms. Inglessis says she is not lying about what she saw. She tells the court she did not want to give evidence in the case. <br>The judge has now thanked her and we will be moving back to Heard again shortly.</p>\n<p>Heard is now back in the witness box and Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, is questioning her. She wants to move on to a short point about Heard's restraining order against the actor, she says, after their break-up in 2016. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard was \"not limited\" to what she could or couldn't say. <br>Heard says no, she was told by her attorney to \"keep it brief\" and had no personal knowledge of how she should proceed. <br>There was no need for Heard to attend the courthouse for an appearance about it, Ms. Laws says. \"No, I don't think so,\" Heard says. <br>Ms. Laws says this is a lie. <br>Heard says this is not true, that her attorney told her she had to \"show up.\u201d</p>\n<p>We are now returning to Thanksgiving 2015, and a video that could not be played earlier. It is a longer clip and we can hear people laughing in it. <br>Ms. Heard confirMs. this was filmed in penthouse five and she can see her friend Raquel \"Rocky\" Pennington, herself, Depp, her father, Depp's son Jack and a woman with dark hair. Heard says this looks like a friend of Depp's named Pat. <br>\"This is a happy family event, isn't it?\" Ms. Laws says. <br>\"Yes, it is,\" Heard replies. However, she says it is \"untrue\" that there was no violence on that night. She says the two things are \"unrelated.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says the video was timestamped after midnight. Before this, they had had a \"brief altercation\", Heard says, but \"relative to other things it was pretty minor.\u201d<br>The court is being shown once again the other video from Thanksgiving, which we have seen already. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard about \"the other side\" of Depp, \"the monster,\" that she has described previously - is this a lie? <br>Heard says no. <br>The words \"savage\" and \"monster\" can be heard being said by Marilyn Manson in the video - the court previously heard he was there on that evening - which Heard agrees sound like a joke in the clip. <br>Asked if these words were used as a joke between them, Heard says this was \"Johnny and his friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws is now moving on to an alleged incident in the Bahamas in December 2015. <br>She reads from the witness statement of Depp's estate manager, Tara Roberts, who said in her witness statement that Heard was \"repeatedly berating\" the actor \"with increasing ferocity.\u201d Ms. Roberts continued: \"She was insulting him, calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught I heard her say specifically 'your career is over', 'no one is going to hire you', 'you\u2019re washed up', 'fat', \u201cyou will die a lonely man'.\" <br>Ms. Heard says these words were said, but actually by Depp, not her.<br>Seriously?<br>That is it for Ms. Laws's cross-examination of the actress. <br>Sasha Wass, for NGN, is going to ask Heard some questions now. <br>Ms. Wass is asking about substance abuse. Heard tells the court she has never had treatment for drug or alcohol abuse of any kind.<br>She admits she did throw a can as she was \"running away\" from the actor.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws accused Heard of \"concocting\" her accusations of violence. \"Mr. Depp has never assaulted you, it has always been you that starts the fight and the rows.\" <br>The judge asks for those parts to be answered separately. <br>Heard says that it is \"untrue\" that Depp never assaulted her and \"untrue\" that she always instigated fights.</p>\n<p>Heard admits she has used cocaine a few times. Asked about alcohol, she says she has never had a problem but chose to stop drinking spirits and most other alcohol when she was 19 due to her background - she has previously said her parents are alcoholics. <br>She says she drinks red wine occasionally.<br>Ms. Wass is asking if Heard has taken cocaine since she was a teenager. <br>\"One time I did, many years after the divorce,\" Heard says. The judge says we can move on. <br>Heard says she never took cocaine while she was with Depp and never encouraged him to take the drug either. <br>Ms. Wass asks if Heard has ever self-harmed; the actress says she never has: \"I have never cut myself, ever.\"<br>Ms. Wass asks Heard about previous evidence she has given claiming Depp has self-harmed. <br>\"His body's full of... scars... I saw him do it to hiMs.elf,\" Heard says.<br>The court is hearing about a mark on Depp's cheek, which Heard says was inflicted by Depp.<br>Ms. Wass asks about Heard's claim that the actor put out a cigarette out on his face. <br>\"It was deliberate,\" Heard says. The actress says Depp was saying he didn't feel it as he was already in so much pain. <br>She says Depp had taken cocaine and other drugs at this point.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wass is directing Heard to look in a file now (we can see quite a lot of big files behind the actress in the witness box). <br>She wants to ask about the actress's relationship with Tasya van Ree, who she was with when she met Depp. <br>Ms. Wass is reading an email from Ms. van Ree which says that Heard was \"wrongfully accused\" of an incident in 2009, which we have heard about previously. <br>\"Was there any truth in the suggestion that you assaulted or beat Ms. van Ree ever?\" Ms. Wass asks. <br>\"Absolutely not,\" Heard says, and adds that they had a \"beautiful\" and \"peaceful\" relationship and good friendship after they broke up. <br>The judge says the answer is \"no.\u201d <br>Ms. Wass is asking about Heard's friend and former assistant Savannah McMillan. <br>The actress has previously answered questions on her from Ms. Laws, about her pay and her title. <br>Ms. Wass is asking about times when Heard travelled abroad and Ms. McMilan was with her - did she work for Heard or someone else? <br>Heard gives specific filMs. she worked on and says production companies paid Ms. McMillan. <br>The court has previously heard how Heard send a letter to Homeland Security officials in the US in 2014, about Ms. McMillan, who is British, to indicate that she was not working \"illegally\" in the US. <br>Heard tells the court the letter was composed by Ms. McMillan but she signed it. <br>Heard tells the court that when flying into the US, Ms. McMillan was detained for several hours, which is when she first learned that there might be a problem.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for today. There will be a full transcript up a bit later, and I\u2019ll edit this update to include it, if I can. I can\u2019t say that I look forward to reading all of this again with the omitted parts in place, but I\u2019ll do it. Johnny deserves that justice.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that I\u2019m blown away by Heard\u2019s allegation that Johnny did all that crap to himself in Australia. Cut his own finger off? Burned his own face with a cigarette? It boggles the mind, on top of all the other spinning, manipulation and outright lying that took place today.</p>\n<p>More tomorrow!</p>", "photo": {"id": "224322954", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/7/zj/bg/AzZJbGjYpawhUOo-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595432706", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27343904", "createdAt": "2020-07-21T15:54:06.000Z", "title": "Amber in the hot seat, day 2", "description": "<p>Amber showed up wearing a cream colored blouse and fawn colored jacket, with her hair braided up over her head. She is again being questioned by\u00a0Eleanor Laws QC, representing Johnny Depp. <br>Johnny arrived late. <a href=\"https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/hn63AieJXM7Zwke917XeNQ/https/media.fyre.co/orwZ625MS.kyRa7CgPe4Q_2020-07-21T092751Z_1701038136_RC2LXH9J38CJ_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-PEOPLE-DEPP.JPG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/hn63AieJXM7Zwke917XeNQ/https/media.fyre.co/orwZ625MS.kyRa7CgPe4Q_2020-07-21T092751Z_1701038136_RC2LXH9J38CJ_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-PEOPLE-DEPP.JPG</a></p>\n<p><br>The last time he showed up late, it was because of a meeting he had about a new role, so it\u2019s possible that today\u2019s tardiness is related to that.</p>\n<p>They picked up where they left off, about Johnny on a rampage the night Amber claimed that he threw a phone at her face, destroying everything he could, from Penthouse 3 where they lived, to the penthouse where Rocky Pennington (RP) kept her beads. She called him crazed and delusional.</p>\n<p>There was a quick chat about what pronoun to use for iO Tillet Wright (iO). Amber explains that iO now prefers the female pronoun \u201cshe.\u201d\u00a0 Heard is shown CCTV footage of herself with concierge Cornelius Harrell in March 2016, and reluctantly admits that it\u2019s her. Mr. Harrell has given statements for court that Amber had no marks on her face. Amber disagrees, naturally. Ms. Laws mentions all the other people who also said she didn\u2019t have any marks on her. Were they all lying?</p>\n<p>Next, Heard is asked about a series of tweets between herself and Elon Musk (EM), but insists that she didn\u2019t have any affairs with anyone while she was with Johnny, not even EM. She wasn\u2019t even in communication with him, she claiMs., until 2016. She says an earlier witness,\u00a0Alejandro Romero, is wrong about seeing her with Musk at an earlier date.</p>\n<p>There is a little back and forth now between Ms. Laws and the judge over whether talk of jealousy is relevant. Heard says in some ways \"all jealousy is illogical.\u201d The judge is not keen to get into philosophical conversations, and moves the subject on.</p>\n<p>The court is now being shown CCTV footage which shows Heard in a lift with actor James Franco. Ms. Laws asks if it is indeed Franco, and Heard says yes. Heard says Franco was saying: \"Oh my god, what happened to you?\" when he saw her face after she went down to let him in. She says his words were \"What the f***.\u201d Ms. Laws asks if they were \"trying to hide their faces\" in the video, and Heard says no. Ms. Laws asks if it was \"secretive talking.\u201d Heard says it was \"discreet talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>We now move onto other events around May 2016. Heard says a text she sent at the time saying she was fearful of Depp was correct, telling Ms. Laws: \"That is true, I was petrified of the monster.\u201d We also hear about part of Heard's statement, in which she says she went to her friends Rocky and Josh's apartment (which was in the same apartment block) to seek refuge from Depp following a big argument on 21 May 2016. In it, she says \"I did not hear from Johnny any more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws reads out multiple texts sent by Heard to Depp's late head of security Jerry Judge on 24 May 2016, which seem to show her trying to get in contact with Depp. One reads, \"Please call me as soon as you get this\"; another \"I'm desperately trying to reach Johnny, can you help?\" and another \"I love you precious.\u201d Heard agrees she was trying to reach Depp. <br>Ms. Laws says this is not the truth, as she was in contact with Depp between 21 and 26 May. But Heard says she was referring to that night, and the incident, and saying she did not see Depp any more that night. Ms. Laws says this is not true.</p>\n<p>We now see a letter written by Heard's lawyer to Depp's lawyer on 24 May 2016, asking for their separation to be kept out of the public eye. Ms. Laws asks Heard: \"You didn't want publicity around this did you?\" Heard agrees. Heard says her lawyer \"told me I needed only the last couple of instances of violence, which had ironically been the last couple of times I saw Johnny.\u201d The letter says there had been three instances of domestic violence in the last six months. When asked by Ms. Laws which instances these are, Heard says \"there are honestly so many, I don't recall which ones they are.\u201d Ms. Laws says: \"Just days before this case started you remembered lots of new cases of alleged violence.\u201d Ms. Heard says this is not true.</p>\n<p>The judge explains to Heard that what Ms. Laws is getting at is that if there had been more instances of domestic violence, they would have been included in the letter. Heard says this is not so, and her lawyer said it was \"a short application.\u201d Ms. Laws counters: \"You make things up as you go along.\u201d That\u2019s the second time in two days that Ms. Laws has used that statement. And IMHO, she was right both times.</p>\n<p>On the 23 May, Heard filed for divorce. Ms. Laws says several people - Depp's artist friend Isaac Baruch and\u00a0concierge manager\u00a0Trinity Esparza\u00a0- saw Heard on this day and both say Heard had no injuries. Heard says she doesn't recall seeing Ms. Esparza, but she does vaguely\u00a0recall seeing Mr Baruch.</p>\n<p>The following day, 24 May, Ms. Laws says Amber did see housekeeper\u00a0Hilda\u00a0Vargas. She also says she disputes Ms. Vargas's claim that she wasn't wearing make-up.</p>\n<p>We also discuss stylist Samantha McMillan, who also said she saw Heard without make up, and saw no injuries. Heard disagrees and says: \"She has only seen me at photo shoots.\u201d She says she only ever saw her with make up on. Heard says she would put make up on first thing in the day, and that as she is often photographed, this was how she would always appear. <br>Ms. Laws asks if that meant Ms. McMillan always arrived late to shoots. Ms. Laws says it is \"inconceivable\" Ms. McMillan would not have seen Heard without make up at some point. <br>Heard says this is not so.</p>\n<p><br>Ms. Laws says the letter from Heard's lawyer to Depp's was a form of \"blackmail.\u201d You know, the one where she demanded everything from the apartment and his car to spousal support, right down to Johnny paying for Amber\u2019s laundry. Heard says this is not so, and that she wanted to let him know \"this could be done amicably.\u201d <br>Heard says she was not afraid to talk to Depp on the phone, but was afraid of him. Ms. Laws says this is not true, and that Heard was not afraid of Depp, she was simply wanting it to seem like she was.</p>\n<p>The court is now being shown more CCTV footage - it is black and white with no sound - and shows Heard in the lift with her sister and Rocky Pennington. They are heading out of the apartment. Ms. Laws says it shows Herd - who is on the far left - had no bruise on her cheek. In similar footage, as the three women return home that night, we can again see Heard standing by the lift doors. Heard says it was at around 10 or 11pm. Ms. Laws now moves on to a few hours later, in the early hours of the same night. Heard says \"my memory is not clear\" on events on that night. Ms. Laws says she would remember if she called her lawyer first that night. Talking again about the letter between lawyers, which mentions three alleged domestic violence incidents, Heard says: \"I was trying to protect Johnny. I wasn't ready to reveal everything I'd been trying to hide for four-and-a-half years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heard is discussing texts she sent to Depp around the time she filed for divorce. She says: \"I wanted him to understand I loved him, and it didn't need to be any more acrimonious than it already was.\u00a0 I just wanted privacy.\u201d She goes on: \"As naive as it sounds, at the time, just a few days of privacy seemed like an enormous thing to me.\u201d One text from Heard says: \"I thought you'd filed.\u201d Heard confirMs. this meant she thought Depp had or was going to file for divorce.</p>\n<p>Another lift clip is shown to the court, this time in color and filmed on the 23 May 2016. Heard is in the lift with Rocky and interior designer Laura Divenere. Ms. Laws says they were all up close in the lift. Now a second clip of the lobby is being played, showing Heard in the lobby taking to Ms. Esparza. Again, they are talking over the desk and seem very close to one another. \"You had no injury did you?\" Ms. Laws asks. She goes on, \"And it's wrong to say you rarely communicated with the staff.\u201d <br>Heard answers: \"Ms. Laws, I lived in that flat a long time and I talked to them on occasions.\u201d She says she did not \u201coften\u201d talk with them.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws references a clip where she says Heard and her sister Whitney \"acted out some sort of punching scene.\u201d <br>Heard says this is not true. We are not shown any clip of this.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws asks if Heard saw Isaac Baruch after she had filed for a restraining order. She asks: \"Did you see him afterwards, and ask him out to dinner?\" <br>Heard answers: \"I did see him, but I didn't ask him out to dinner, I asked him if he wanted something I had cooked. He liked my cooking.\u201d</p>\n<p>We now move on to a telephone call between Depp and Heard. Heard says she believes this call is \"one Johnny asked me if I was recording, and I said no, and he recorded it.\" Ms. Laws says: \"Let's be clear, this is a recording you have provided yourself. So you know about this call.\u201d In this phone call, reference is made to a \"secret fight club.\u201d Ms. Laws says that when she asked Heard if she knew which transcript they were discussing, and mentioned \"secret fight club\" she denied knowledge of it. Heard denies this, and says it's because Ms. Laws \"mis-spoke.\u201d Ms. Laws says Heard has made the point \"four times\" that she didn't know which transcript Ms. Laws was talking about, and she is now moving on. Ms. Laws asks: \"Are you unhappy that you recorded this conversation?.\u201d Heard says no, she is unhappy that Depp told her he wasn't recording the conversation, and then she found out he was. She says they often recorded conversations between theMs.elves. Ms. Laws says Heard received \"bad publicity after she filed\" and Heard was \"angry about this.\u201d Heard says: \"I was angry, but mostly heartbroken. My marriage had ended, it was a really hard time.\u201d Ms. Laws says during the recorded phone conversation violence from the past is discussed. Ms. Laws reads out an extract from the transcript in which Depp says \"I had a jar of mineral spray thrown at my f***ing nose.\u201d It also mentions him losing the tip of his finger and Heard allegedly being violent towards him. Ms. Laws puts it to Heard that she had been violent to Depp, and she didn't deny it in the call. <br>Heard says: \"I wasn't in a place to deny or agree to it. I was trying to point out to him the reality of the system and how nasty, and violent this whole thing had been.\u201d She goes on: \"Johnny surrounded hiMs.elf with people who wouldn't disagree with him.\u201d She says he was \"almost never in contact with outside world.\u201d Heard says Depp \"severed his own finger.\u201d She says Depp's \"perception of our relationship was so skewed\" he didn't realise how bad things were.\u00a0Heard says: \"He was twice my size and beat me up for years.\u201d She says \"it's preposterous\" Depp says he was the victim of violence. <br>IMHO, what\u2019s preposterous is Heard saying that Johnny is twice her size. She stands nearly as tall as him, and is perfectly capable of swinging a fist.</p>\n<p>Like yesterday, Amber\u2019s making good use of her water bottle, sipping from it liberally.</p>\n<p>We are now talking about the night of Heard's 30th birthday party on 21 May 2016. Ms. Laws asks if when Depp arrived he was \"coherent, sociable, logical and you were affectionate towards one another.\u201d <br>Heard says, \"Yes, but he was also under the influence and high.\u201d Ms. Laws says Heard is the only one alleging that, and Heard says that's not true.</p>\n<p>We hear that Depp had received \"monumental news\" about his finances that evening, before arriving at the birthday meal. During Depp's evidence last week he told the court he\u00a0lost $650m when former business managers \"stole\" his money.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws reads out texts from Depp to Heard, which seem to show Depp apologising for being late. There is a little confusion over the date of these texts, and Heard says she thinks they might be from the day before the birthday party. Confusingly, the texts are actually dated the 22nd May, which would make them the day after. <br>Heard says she thinks they are from before the party, as they mention \"fittings for the Met Gala.\u201d She has to repeat \"Met Gala\" for the judge, who doesn't seem too familiar with the event.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws says Heard knew Depp had an important meeting with his accountant, and Heard says is aware that he had the meeting. Ms. Laws says after the party Heard \"went on and on\" at Depp over being late. Heard says she was \"upset he was late for my birthday.\u201d <br>Heard says he had scheduled his meeting just half an hour before her celebratory meal, and was still late. Ms. Laws asks whether Heard \"punched Depp in the face\" on that night. Heard replied \"Absolutely not.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says Depp called his security guard Sean Bett to come and get him. <br>Heard says, \"Johnny didn't drive, he was driven. It was normal for him to call someone to drive him after he would beat-up on me.\u201d <br>We hear a text exchange in which Depp says Heard \"hay-makered me.\u201d This US phrase means to punch wildly. Ms. Laws says Heard did not dispute this in the texts.</p>\n<p>The following day Heard's friend Rocky came to her flat, and Ms. Laws says Heard did not tell her Depp had hit her. Heard says this is not true, and she had texted Rocky the night before to tell her there had been an incident. \"When she [Rocky] walked into the room it was covered in glass from things Johnny had thrown at me. Johnny was fond of glass bottles.\u201d Heard says Rocky saw all the damage. That day Heard, her sister and a group of friends headed out to\u00a0Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. <br>Heard is asked if she was excited about going to Coachella. <br>Heard answers: \"I couldn't be excited, my husband had beaten me up on my 30th birthday.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asks: \"And then you excreted on the bed?\" <br>Heard says she did not, and \"it's absolutely disgusting.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asks if it was one of Heard's friends who had messed on the bed, and Heard says no, it's \"unimaginable to me.\u201d <br>Heard says Yorkshire Terrier Boo had had a problem with messing herself \"since the weed.\u201d She explains that when Boo was a puppy she ate a bag of Depp's\u00a0marijuana, and had had issues since then. <br>Heard is asked if cleaner Hilda Vargas regularly cleaned up after the dogs (Pistol and Boo), and Heard says occasionally. <br>Heard says she would usually clean up excrement in the bed as she thought it was unfair for the cleaner to have to deal with it. Heard says Boo would often cuddle with Johnny, and mess herself on him or the bed. She says she heard Ms. Vargas giving evidence last week. In that, we heard that Ms. Vargas believed the excrement to be human rather than animal. \"I cannot imagine what kind of human being would do that for a prank or joke\" Heard tells the court. She says she was not there though, and had headed to Coachella by this time. Heard says she does not recall if she took the dogs with her or not.</p>\n<p>We are now moving on to what Ms. Laws calls the \"bathroom incident.\u201d Heard says there were many incidents involving the bathroom, and involving doors, so asks for more clarity on which incident this was. The court is about to be played some audio, which we are told is undated. We can hear Depp talking in this, but his voice is very muted. He seeMs. to be apologising for closing the door into Heard's toes. He says: \"I didn't mean to do that.\u201d We can now hear Heard, who is saying she did not mean to push the door into Depp, but reacted to the door hitting her toes. She says \"It was not my intention.\u201d We can hear Heard saying \"I'm so sorry. I can remember hitting you as a response. And I'm really sorry about hitting you in the head with the door.\u201d She goes on, \"I just reacted and I'm sorry, it's below me.\" <br>Ms. Laws asks: \"You admitted punching him in the face there?\" <br>Heard says: \"No.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says: \"And it was not in self-defence was it?\" <br>Heard answers: \"That's exactly what it was.\u201d She says at the time Depp was \"falling against the door and screaming out incoherently.\u201d <br>She says she had previously kept an eye on him to check he wasn't choking on his own vomit. She says she \"pushed the door as an instinct. to get it off of me as it was putting pressure on my body.\u201d Heard says: \"I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him. My job was to say sorry, and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.\u201d She says doing so would have \"made him more mad, enraged, and he would have got more violent with me.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says every time there is evidence showing Ms. Heard admitting to violence, she \"turns it round\" and alleges self-defence. \"It's what you do isn't it?\" Ms. Laws adds.</p>\n<p>We are now about to be played audio of another conversation between Depp and Heard. Again, this audio is hard to hear. We hear Heard saying: \"You're trying to justify how you do or don't come to the door.\u201d <br>Depp says: \"You seem to think there's this cowardice in me, running away from me.\u201d He says \"the only time I did things to you was when you threw the can at me in Australia.\u201d <br>We hear Heard saying she \"threw pots and pans.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asks if Heard said in the audio that was in self-defence? <br>Heard answers \"that was not the point of the conversation.\u201d<br>Ms. Laws says in this case Heard \"does not want to ever admit to using violence against Mr Depp. You don't want to admit the truth - that you were violent do you?\" <br>Heard says this is not true.</p>\n<p>We now hear about what Ms. Laws calls the stair incident, which Ms. Laws says was \"very violent.\u201d <br>Ms. Heard says she was only ever violent \"in defence of myself and my sister.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says Heard spat at Depp. <br>Heard answers: \"I never spit at anyone\" <br>Ms. Laws says Heard threw a can of Red Bull at Depp's back. <br>Heard answers: \"I don't even drink Red Bull, no.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says Heard punched Depp in the face. <br>Heard agrees: \"I did strike Johnny that day, in defence of my sister.\u201d <br>Heard says the reason for this is: \"I heard the rumour he pushed an ex-girlfriend down the stairs - I think it was Kate Moss - and that was fresh in my mind. So I reacted quickly.\" Heard goes on: \"I have been Johnny's punching bag for years. And I remember this as it was the first incident when I ever struck him back. Ms. Laws puts it to Heard that this is the first time she has ever mentioned Kate Moss in relation to this incident. <br>For a second (third) time Ms. Laws tells Heard: \"You are making this up as you go along.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says there has been no mention of Moss in Heard's deposition, and she has never before said this was the reason she \"punched Depp\" during the stair incident. The court is now being played Heard's deposition, which was also shown in court yesterday. In the deposition Heard is asked \"have you ever hit Johnny Depp?\" <br>Heard is told by her lawyers, \"You don't have to answer.\u201d<br>She says she was protecting \"my baby sister\" and she jumped up to \"act defensively to protect her life.\u201d She says \"I would have done anything to prevent her from being pushed down the stairs. She says any sibling or parent would do the same. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she didn't mention Moss in the deposition. <br>Heard says: \"I didn't have a chance.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asks if Heard has mentioned Moss in any statement, deposition or evidence so far. <br>Heard agrees she has not. Heard says \"She had anything but the freedom to speak\" and was \"surrounded by 14 lawyers\" on the recorded deposition shown to the court. <br><a href=\"https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/LMT5MrirBwU7b3aoqCnRWg/https/media.fyre.co/RU3QItsVTziZ05gQGGlH_GettyImages-75480804.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/LMT5MrirBwU7b3aoqCnRWg/https/media.fyre.co/RU3QItsVTziZ05gQGGlH_GettyImages-75480804.jpg</a> <br>For a third (fourth) time Ms. Laws says: \"You are making this up as you go along sometimes. You add information you have thought of on your feet to try to make your account more detailed.\u201d <br>Heard refutes this.</p>\n<p>We have now moved on to an alleged attack on Heard by Depp on 23\u00a0March 2015, when he is said to have pulled her by the hair and hit her.</p>\n<p>Heard tells the court: \"He hit me with the hard plaster cast, and my sister Whitney. It was particularly unpleasant.\u201d <br>At the time Depp had his finger in a cast due to an injury sustained in Australia. He chose one of the children's designs for the cast, with a picture of a baby dinosaur on in. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she did not mention the cast in her statement. Heard says she cannot mention every accessory or detail of every incident.</p>\n<p>After the lunch break, the court is shown a photo of Heard with Rolling Stone Keith Richards, along with her sister. Heard confirMs. she is second left in the picture. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard if it's correct there is no bruise on her cheek. <br>Heard says she cannot tell.<br><a href=\"https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/rRkWYKCWHX99xoLSA3I_xg/https/media.fyre.co/8pCmJR7gRWjNEXyPkoHs_Keith%20Richards%20photo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/rRkWYKCWHX99xoLSA3I_xg/https/media.fyre.co/8pCmJR7gRWjNEXyPkoHs_Keith%20Richards%20photo.jpg</a> <br>Heard says this photo was taken \"right before\" the painting incident. She says her previous reference to \"disco bloodbath\" was actually in relation to another fight, not the argument over a painting by her ex-partner Tasya Van Ree. Heard has alleged Depp hit her because the picture was hung up in her bedroom, and that Depp tried to set fire to art work.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws now asks detailed questions about the \"disco bloodbath\" fight. She asks: \"How did he hit you in such a way that blood spattered on the wall?\" <br>Heard says: \"Back then it was just slaps or backhands, and at the time it was a shock. I felt his rings hit my mouth, my teeth.\" <br>Ms. Laws asks: \"How close were you?\" <br>Heard answers: \"We were at his downtown place in the Eastern Columbia building. All the details of these incidents remain true. I remember them perfectly. There has been a mistake with dates. That particular incident which we called disco bloodbath happened on the 8th, downtown. \" <br>Ms. Laws now tries to interrupt, but the judge cuts in saying: \"It's easier if I can hear one person at a time.\u201d He says Hurd is answering the question, and he wants to hear it. <br>Heard goes on: \"All I can tell you is Johnny wore these rings. He backhanded me. We got into an argument because he said I'd had affairs with two people I never had an affair with.\u201d Heard says the blow \"popped my teeth.\u201d She says she was standing next to the living room, and she recalls \"the next day there was blood next to the Smeg fridge. The next day Johnny made a joke about it.\u201d Heard says the wall was around two or three feet away from her at the time. <br>Ms. Laws is keen to know the angle and exact proximity. <br>Ms. Laws is now asking: \"What did the blood spatter look like?\" <br>Heard says she cannot recall, going on: \"We made light of it. It's hard to believe, but I was so quick to think it would never happen again.\" <br>\"How many drops of blood?,\u201d Ms. Laws asks. <br>The judge interrupts again and says he doesn't think knowing the exact amount of blood is helpful.<br>Ms. Laws is putting it to Heard that she changed her account of the date of the alleged painting incident as there was the Keith Richards photo showing her with a clear face the day after the alleged fight. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard shifted the painting fight to 22 March 2013, and said the disco bloodbath fight happened on the 8 March. <br>Heard says no, she had no need to change the dates, and that she has always said the disco bloodbath was on 8 March. <br>The judge asks for clarification of what \"disco bloodbath\" means. <br>Heard says: \"He hit me, and split my lip, a blood went on the wall and on my shirt.\u201d She says the phrase was used by Depp later, and is the title of a book. She says she asked him if that was in reference to the alleged fight on Friday. <br>Ms. Laws tells Heard she has \"missed an important detail\" in her statement, and that's why she changed the date. <br>Heard says that is not the case, but says there were \"so many incidents in March\" that she got mixed up as to what happened at each one.</p>\n<p>We are now looking at the Keith Richards photo again, and Amber says she can't be sure there isn't damage to her face. She says: \"My bottom lip looks swollen to me.\u201d <br>Sasha Wass, the lawyer for The Sun, has now interjected. <br>The judge is getting a little cross over lawyers in court talking over each other, and says for a second time he can only listen to one person at a time.</p>\n<p>Heard is now being asked to look at screen shots taken on 7 April 2013. <br>Ms. Laws says we will also be discussing flight details relating to a man called Ian Patrick McLagan, who has played the guitar for the Rolling Stones.<br>Ms. Laws asks, \"You have seen these documents before haven't you?\" <br>Heard says she has seen so many documents she can't tell, and then adds \"I don't think I have seen this.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws says it's these flight details that have caused Heard to change her dates in her earlier statement. <br>Heard refutes this.<br>The documents include an email chain about flights and travel to set. Depp's lawyer\u00a0Stephen Deuters\u00a0is cc'd in.</p>\n<p>Ms. Heard says she \"vaguely\u00a0recognizes\" the second photo with\u00a0Ian Patrick McLagan.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws says Heard hasn't just changed the dates, she has also \"shifted the more lurid and graphic\" accounts to earlier in the timeline (specifically 8 March), to explain her clear face in the dated photos.<br>Ms. Laws says Heard is \"treading a fine line\" as her sister Whitney has already said in her statement that Heard had a split lip after the painting incident. <br>Heard says no, the truth is that Depp \"hit me a lot in March.\" <br>We now look at Heard's sister's statement - Whitney\u00a0Henriquez - talking about arriving at Heard's apartment after the painting incident. Whitney says when she came home on the day Depp should have been filming a documentary with Keith Richards, she came home \"and the place was a mess.\u201d She says the painting had been taken off the wall, and she noticed the signature of the painting had been altered. <br>Whitney also says \"it was apparent she [Heard] had been crying, her face was swollen. I noticed that one side of her face was super-red and she had a split lip.\" <br>Ms. Laws tells Heard: \"Your sister has made the made mistake as you, saying you had a red face and swollen lip on the day you went to the filming of the Keith Richard's documentary.\" <br>Ms. Laws says this is a description of an \"obvious and clear injury, which we can't see in any of the photographs.\" <br>Ms. Laws goes on: \"You have quite a difficult path to tread because of all the lies you've woven. You've woven a web of lies which you've had to shift and change because of evidence that's come to light around this Keith Richards documentary.\" <br>Heard disagrees.<br>We are now looking at a photo of the painting, which shows the altered signature, changed from \"Taysa van Ree\" to \"Taysa van Pee\u2019 <br>We hear a text message exchange between Depp and Whitney, in which Whitney seeMs. to be cheering him on for defacing the image. <br>One reads: \"She' s the worst,\u201d apparently referring to van Ree. <br>The judge asks if Heard has \"tried to construct an incident around these documents\u2019 <br>Heard says no, \"It's a totally different painting, and I don't think Johnny realised that\u2019 <br>Heard says Depp defaced multiple paintings, and \"the one he tried to light on fire was a canvas\u2019 \u00a0<br>Ms. Laws says \"multiple paintings\" is now \"another detail added\u2019 <br>Heard says the number of paintings he destroyed was \"countless\u2019 <br>For the fourth (fifth) time, Ms. Laws tells Heard she is \"making it up as she goes along\u2019 <br>Heard says in the text exchange, which seeMs. to say she also found the image tampering \"funny,\u201d it is because on that occasion \"you could wipe the mark off the glass\u2019 She says Ms. Laws is mixing up two different painting incidents, one in 2012 and one in 2014. <br>Heard says: \"I didn't shift anything\u2019</p>\n<p>After a 10minute break, they went into the three day \"hostage situation\" Heard says she suffered at the hands of Depp in early March 2015. <br>Ms. Laws says Heard has alleged \"extreme acts of physical, emotional and psychological violence\" in her earlier violence. <br>Ms. Laws says she wants to find out exactly what physical violence took place.<br>A sentence in Heard's statement says: \"I fell like a rag doll.\u00a0 I got back up and he said something like \u201cYou want to go? You want to fight, tough guy?\u201d and he slapped me in the face.\" <br>Another says: \"\u00a0He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me against the fridge\u2019 It goes on: \"Over the course of the day, he kept attacking me \u2013 he hit me, pushed me, choked me and spat in my face.\" <br>Ms. Laws goes on to another extract which reads: \"I tried to run past him to get away and he grabbed me by the hair, hurled me around. I fell onto the ping pong table and it collapsed under me. He ended up on top of me.\" <br>In Another part of the statement about the same incident, Heard says Depp \"ripped off my gown\" and later smashed her phone so hard \"It broke into pieces\u2019 <br>Ms. Laws now moves on to an alleged incident on day two of the \"three day incident\u2019 <br>In her statement Heard says: \"\u00a0Glass was broken everywhere \u2013 on the floor and the counter-top. At some point he pulled me around by my neck and pushed me down against the bar, I was against the bar, naked, bent over backwards, my back against the marble. He was pressing so hard on my neck I couldn\u2019t breathe. <br>A visibly and audibly upset Heard now tells the court: \"I was naked and my feet were bare, so I couldn't get a purchase on my feet... I was trying to push away from the counter top so I could breathe. I thought he had lost control of what he had done, I was slipping on the counter tops and slipping on the glass\u2019 <br>Heard is crying a little as she says this. <br>In her statement Heard says she still has scars from the glass on her feet and arMs..</p>\n<p>As the cross-examination moves to a photo taken of the injuries Heard alleges occurred on the trip, she wipes her nose with a tissue. <br>Heard says she took these photos herself in the bathroom. <br>Talking about the photos, Ms. Laws says: \"These are not scars sustained writhing around on the floor trying to get away from Mr Depp. They are straight.\" <br>Heard says: \"I do not agree, I know they are\u2019 <br>Ms. Laws suggests they are \"self-harm scars, inflicted by you\u2019<br>Heard answers: \"I have had them since that night... I have never self-harmed. Johnny's a self-harmer, I'm not a self-harmer.\" <br>Ms. Laws is now questioning Heard's comparison of the situation with being \"a hostage\u2019 She says, \"You could have left at any time couldn't you?\u2019 She goes on, \"And you had a cell phone didn't you - you could have called anyone at any point\u2019 <br>Heard accepts she did have a phone, and could have called someone. <br>However Heard says she has not mis-characterised the situation, saying: \"Absolutely not. This was my marriage. I lived in it.\u201d<br>Ms. Laws says the three days are a \"graphic depiction of the three day hostage situation,\u201d and questions why Heard didn't record any of this at the time. <br>Heard says that Depp had \"taken eight to ten MDMA on the first night, maybe even more. There was no valuable conversation between us that would have been worth recording.\"<br>Ms. Laws is asking about a phone call from Heard to her sister shortly after the Australia incident. <br>Ms. Laws asks why she did not tell her sister about what had happened. <br>Heard says: \"I can't remember what I said to her, but I certainly wouldn't have recalled everything that had happened to me.\u201d<br>We are now talking about an audio recording, which appears to have been taken on Heard's phone but which she says Depp recorded. The audio is said to last \"seven or eight hours.\u201d <br>Heard says \"years later\" she realised Depp had recorded it, and she only understood this once it \"came up in my divorce proceedings.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asks why this is not mentioned in her statements. <br>Ms. Heard says she can't mention everything. <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard when she discovered her phone after the recording had been taken. <br>Heard says it was the next day, as she \"had been given some drugs, and slept.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asked how Heard managed to call her sister if the phone was recording, and Heard says maybe on her iPad or through Facetime, but she \"has no recollection of that call.\u201d <br>Ms. Laws asks Heard: \"You use your phone a lot and don't like to be away from your phone?\" <br>Heard answers: \"I wouldn't characterize myself that way.\"<br>Ms. Laws is asking Heard if she ever listened to the long audio file on her phone. <br>Heard says: \"At some point, but maybe I just read transcripts, I can't remember.\u201d <br>There is also apparently a second recording, taken several hours later. <br>The judge asks if Heard knows if it was her phone that recorded both. Heard says she doesn't know, \"But that was my suspicion.\u201d <br>He then asks if she called her sister on her phone. <br>Heard says: \"I can't remember making that call.\u201d <br>Heard asks the judge if she can ask a question. <br>The judge says: \"This is a one-way process , so it's not for you to ask questions to Ms. Laws.\u201d He asks Ms. Laws to continue in her questioning.</p>\n<p>Ms. Laws is asking where Heard spoke to her sister, and whether it was upstairs. <br>Again, Heard says she can't remember, but she says she did go upstairs at some point. <br>Ms. Laws is pushing the point that she wants to know why the phone has recorded a conversation with her sister, close by the phone, but she was not using the phone itself. <br>Heard says Jerry Judge (Depp's late head of security) was downstairs. <br>Ms. Laws asks why heard was not looking for her phone. <br>Heard answers: \"After everything I'd been through, strangled, hit, sexually assaulted, the last thing I was thinking about was where my cell phone was.\u201d<br>Ms. Laws is asking Heard why she returned to a bedroom she claiMs. she had been assaulted in, to which the actress replies: \"It was not the room that was the problem.\" \u00a0</p>\n<p>Talk then returns to an allegation made yesterday in court by Heard, that Depp took her vintage Ford Mustang from her. <br>We move on to documentation over an MOT. However, at this point, the judge suggests it's a good place to end for the day.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t even get me started on how ludicrous this testimony is or this update will be twice as long. Suffice it to say I\u2019m outraged over the bullsh*t that got dropped by Amber Heard today.</p>\n<p>More as I find it, folks.</p>", "photo": {"id": "224316765", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/6/ji/qt/cCJIqTIqGdJenNr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595346847", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27335583", "createdAt": "2020-07-20T15:43:03.000Z", "title": "Amber Heard on the stand", "description": "<p>This is a long one, folks.</p>\n<p>We began the day with a van outside the court with a large display featuring Amber Heard with the caption: Ditch the Witch, and a lot of supporters for Johnny Depp.</p>\n<p>Inside the court, things started off with few legal arguments back and forth about the allowance and review of some written submissions that were apparently put in at the last minute, doesn\u2019t say what they are. The judge gave both parties until 1pm tomorrow to review and respond to them.</p>\n<p>The defense also complained about Adam Waldman tweeting his \u201cIn memoriam\u201d tweet from court and asked that AW be forced to desist from tweeting. DS called this a stunt, but the judge agreed that the phrase \u201cIn memoriam\u201d is unwelcome because it might be misconstrued as a threat and left it there. AW wasn\u2019t instructed not to tweet, as I understand it.</p>\n<p>Amber Heard takes the stand wearing a short-sleeved light colored v-neck blouse with her hair braided over one shoulder. She confirms that her witness statement is true and correctly signed. Now that she\u2019s been sworn in, her witness statement will be released to the public and we\u2019ll be able to see what nonsense she\u2019s come up with, including whatever she testifies to in private.</p>\n<p>Out of the gate, Amber\u2019s witness statement starts off painting her as the poor little victim to Johnny Depp\u2019s \u201cmonster\u201d getting brutalized, and woe is her, the poor little thing.</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>She also insisted that he tried to control her professional life, reviewing her scripts and berating any romantic scenes she was in and insinuating that he told her what parts she could or couldn\u2019t take based on whether or not there were nudity or romantic scenes. And she said that he began to say that she dressed like a whore and began to tell her what she could and couldn\u2019t wear. She certainly did her homework about what real victims go through. Pity, though, that this is the first we\u2019re hearing about all this, four years later. She even said that Johnny said that he hoped she\u2019d get raped by \u201cSlimy Mexicans\u201d or a big gang of black MF-ers because of the sexy or revealing clothes she wore, accusing him not only of verbal abuse, but also of using racial slurs to do it with.</p>\n<p>Mind you, this is all in her witness statement. She hasn\u2019t begun to testify yet.</p>\n<p>Out of the gate, Amber shows what a liar she is. Throughout her relationship with Johnny, she kept her house on Orange Ave, which means that she was never in danger of being homeless, like she claimed when trying to keep Johnny\u2019s penthouse.</p>\n<p>Also from the beginning, the female barrister isn\u2019t having any of Amber\u2019s showboating (which I almost misspelled as sow-boating, which would have been just as appropriate). Whenever Amber tried to add or embellish, FB yanked the chain and got the subject succinctly back on track.</p>\n<p>FB\u2019s first questions to Amber were about her family and friends that came to live in the Eastern Columbia building penthouses rent free.</p>\n<p>Next, Amber admitted that she didn\u2019t sign a prenup, nor was she asked to. But FB produced an email from David Kipper (a doctor) saying that Johnny and Amber had been fighting non-stop because he wanted a prenup. So she didn\u2019t get five minutes in without contradicting herself with a lie. It also bears mention that Amber is so animated and agitated that the judge asked her to slow down with her answers.</p>\n<p>They went back and forth about the prenup that never got signed, with Amber managing to get in that JD beat her up over it, of course. It\u2019s rather hard to keep up with AH because she seemingly contradicts herself with every breath. There was no prenup, then there was. First Johnny wanted it, then it was his sister Cristy who wanted it, as well as a litany of his friends. But in the end, there WAS a prenup that simply never got signed.</p>\n<p>She said at least twice that Johnny insisted that the only way out of the marriage was death. Implying, I supposed that he\u2019d kill her before he\u2019d let her go. Painting him as that monster again. Joke\u2019s on her, innit? Because he did let her go.</p>\n<p>Once again, the judge stops Amber from giving such lengthy answers that stray from the question. FB made this easier by asking a series of yes or no questions. Love her!</p>\n<p>ML is FB asked about Amber\u2019s statement that she didn\u2019t take cocaine after the age of 18. Amber insisted that it was true, and that she didn\u2019t take coke in front of Johnny, ever.</p>\n<p>I swear, it\u2019s almost impossible to keep up with Amber\u2019s answers because she either contradicts herself so much, or she picks a fringe point to answer without addressing the direct question. Asked if she had coke issues, she says she never had anxiety eating disorders, which was mentioned, but wasn\u2019t the point at all.</p>\n<p>Amber insists that she never had anxiety eating disorder, is not bipolar, and never had a substance abuse problem. Dr Kipper, who wrote notes about all of the above, is either lying, got it wrong, or made a mistake. He\u2019s the one, she says, that put her on such a range of meds that she\u2019s lost track of them all.</p>\n<p>ML nailed AH on taking drugs at Coachella, where Amber\u2019s memory seems spotty about who she took MDMA and mushrooms with. First Amber said that she took them, but doesn\u2019t remember who she took them with, then changed her story to say that she didn\u2019t take them, and still doesn\u2019t remember who she didn\u2019t take them with. ML reminds her that it\u2019s a high profile male she\u2019s talking about, but Amber still feigns amnesia about it.</p>\n<p>Amber then denies taking MDMA or mushrooms in Australia. She insists that she\u2019s only done shrooms or MDMA (ecstasy) a handful of times, including Coachella and her bachelorette party. So Coachella\u2019s back on the map. ML: So lots of medical professionals are either lying or misrepresenting Heard\u2019s drug use? Amber blames it on Johnny, saying that HE misrepresented her drug use to all these people.</p>\n<p>Amber denies being the one who puked in the parking lot at Coachella, insisting that she\u2019s never barfed in a parking lot in her life. Instead, she blames the vomiting incident on her (then) pregnant sister. But a note/email to a friend says that Amber admitted to puking in the parking lot and being high for 24 hours. Amber tried to turn it around on Johnny, saying that he\u2019s the one that did drugs, but ML (love her!) asked Amber to try to answer the question without making negative comments about her ex-husband. Amber had to agree to just answer the questions.</p>\n<p>It bears noting that at every step of Amber\u2019s testimony, netizens in the Twitterverse were posting screen grabs that directly contradict her. And a picture is worth a thousand words. If you haven\u2019t followed Nick Wallis on Twitter, it\u2019s worth looking him up, reading his spot-on live tweeting, and having a look at the comments. They tell the real story, unlike Amber.</p>\n<p>Next, ML asked about Amber\u2019s allegation that Johnny took her mustang away from her for 3.5 years, or longer, Amber added. She says he took the car and had his drivers take her everywhere so that he could keep tabs on where he was going. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I wouldn\u2019t care if he knew where I was if I wasn\u2019t doing something shady. There was some discussion at length about Johnny fixing the car up on the tv show Overhaulin in order to get out of paying for it and how Amber alleges that the car didn\u2019t work right after the show \u2013 despite the plethora of photos she\u2019s taken of herself driving \u201cCherry Thunder\u201d as she\u2019s dubbed it. How this has anything to do with the Sun calling Johnny a wife-beater is beyond me, but hey. What do I know?</p>\n<p>They moved on to a matter of whether or not Samantha McMillen worked for, and was paid by, Amber Heard. Amber insists that SM never worked for her during a certain period, that she was only along as a \u201cfriend\u201d or unpaid intern, but EL refers to a document where Amber admits to paying SM $1,300, complete with a photocopy of a check. To be honest, I don\u2019t know what this has to do with the Sun, either, but it certainly does discredit Amber\u2019s integrity as a witness, insisting that SM wasn\u2019t her assistant, despite SM getting paid.</p>\n<p>Amber was asked about her temper, and admitted that she had outbursts of rage during arguments with JD, but evidence was presented that Amber just has a bad temper in general, and has outbursts with more people than just Johnny Depp. Proven.</p>\n<p>They played the tape where Amber admits to punching/hitting him, and admits to starting the fight. But Amber still insists that she was only reacting to Johnny\u2019s violence towards her. Regarding the bathroom door incident, she says that she only pushed the door to keep Johnny from falling down, because, she says, he had a tendency to pass out drunk and vomit all over himself. Everyone who says she was the violent one, she says, is lying for Johnny. She only acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p>After lunch, they stuck to the topic of Amber\u2019s temper, which she said only got out of hand with Johnny, and only in response to his violence toward her. EL puts forth that that\u2019s not true, and addresses Amber\u2019s arrest for domestic violence against Tasya Van Ree in Washington in 2009. Amber insists that her relationship with Van Ree is the most peaceful relationship that she\u2019s ever heard of, despite evidence of screaming matches and that arrest which Amber downplays as a non-event.</p>\n<p>Moving on, EL talked about the day Amber went to court and the fact that there was so much press. EL asked if Amber tipped off the press. She said no and blamed the press being there on Johnny\u2019s lawyers and TMZ \u2013 despite the fact that the TMZ article came out well before that. So, no dice there. She says that IF there was a leak of information, it didn\u2019t come from her. It came from somebody else, either on behalf without her knowing, or that it was Johnny\u2019s team. Anybody but her.</p>\n<p>EL then questioned Amber as to why she wanted to meet with Johnny when the restraining order was in effect if she was so petrified of him. Amber gave some half-arsed statement about how she wasn\u2019t afraid of Johnny, she was afraid of the monster.</p>\n<p>Amber was then asked about the night of the fight where Amber says Johnny threw a phone at her face. Amber admits that Rocky Pennington, iO Tillet-Wright and Josh Drew were in the adjoining apartment. Not their own penthouses, as has been previously declared. She also admits that she called her lawyer and her publicist, as well as iO calling the police.</p>\n<p>Every time She was caught lying by somebody else\u2019s testimony and evidence, Amber was asked, \u201cSo are they lying?\u201d She said she didn\u2019t want to call anyone a liar, but then proceeded to call them a liar. She must have said that half a dozen times. Most of what they talked about has been said before, all about the night of that fateful fight and the aftermath. This accounting is long and rambling enough, so I\u2019m not going to repeat it all. Suffice it to say that She says Johnny beat her up, hit her with a phone, and wrecked PH5 where she kept all her personal stuff, including her wardrobe. So, EL asked if the police officers were lying when they said they saw no damage to the property. Amber avoided giving a yes or no answer by saying things like \u201cThey must have seen it,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know how they could have missed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>At one point, EL said: \u201cYou\u2019re making this up as you go along.\u201d AH denied it, of course, but I LOVE EL for saying it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I also love that EL is showing pictures of the magical moving disappearing bruises and asking her to explain them, as well as whey they weren\u2019t there the next day, and why people have testified that she had no marks on her at all. The answers are that the pictures were taken a different day, or she was wearing concealer, and everyone is lying.</p>\n<p>And that was it for the day. And, unless somebody else steps up to live-tweet, that\u2019s pretty much it for my timely updates. I\u2019ve relied upon Nick Wallis\u2019 brilliant live-tweeting for my updates, and he sadly won\u2019t be able to do it anymore. So let\u2019s all say thank you to Nick, and look forward to whatever updates might come our way.</p>", "photo": {"id": "224310705", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/4/da/yv/GgDAYVbkVMexeDi-800x450-noPad.jpg?1595259787", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27322204", "createdAt": "2020-07-18T17:15:40.000Z", "title": "Day 9", "description": "<p>First up today was Isaac Baruch, an artist and friend of Johnny Depp\u2019s since they were teens. Mr. Baruch resided in the Eastern Columbia building at the time of all these goings on. Right out of the gate, QC tries to twist his words and put words in his mouth that he didn\u2019t say. When IB testified that he saw no marks or bruises on the night of the fight, QC began testifying to the opposite. IB asked if there was a question in there somewhere. Likewise, the judge stepped in to put a stop to it, too, to keep the proceedings on track and timely. The QC questions were pretty general, bantering back and forth about how IB has known JD so long, lives rent-free at Johnny\u2019s residence, and might therefore lie out of loyalty. The same old song and dance. Until the Question of Elon musk arose, relating to when EM visited, which dates and what time of day. Usually late at night until morning, and always when Johnny was away. But just as fast as that came up, it was glossed over. So the make takeaway from IB is that on the night that Amber said Johnny threw a phone at her face, she bore no marks at all. None.</p>\n<p>Alejandro Romero is a concierge at the ECB. He was also questioned about EM visiting, from around March of 2016. QC called him a liar about the dates because they don\u2019t match up with her narrative, but AR stood his ground. And that was about it for him. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure what this accomplished in relation to a case of Libel against the Sun for calling Johnny a wife-beater, but maybe it\u2019ll get tied up later.</p>\n<p>Travis McGivern works (worked?) as a security guard for Johnny Depp. QC made short work of browbeating him when he disagreed with her timetable of when he entered Johnny\u2019s penthouse on the night of the that Amber Heard alleges that she only hit Johnny Depp in defense of her sister, Whitney Heard, and with whom. QC asserted that TM entered the apartment with Amber\u2019s nurse, Debbie Lloyd when Amber was already in the apartment, with the fight already underway. TM says that he met Amber in the lobby and left DL there with her and went up to the penthouse alone. Amber came up after and got into it with Johnny. TM is adamant that Amber is the only one that was physically violent, punching Johnny in the head. \u00a0QC started testifying again, but TM kept in line asking for a question and refusing to speculate when she asked him to. The takeaway from this line of questioning is that somebody in the room can testify to the fact that only Amber Heard was violent that night.</p>\n<p>Amanda De Cadanet, founder of the #MeToo movement and former Amber Heard supporter, will not be questioned. She has publicly withdrawn her support for Amber Heard, so this comes as no great surprise. The last thing the defense wants is another explosive testimony supporting Johnny Depp.</p>\n<p>After lunch, there was some debate about metadata and how easily it can be forged, in reference to the May 16, 2016 pictures that Amber Heard had taken. The times in all of those photos, according to metadata, is 00:00, which is impossible if metadata is correct. The bickering started to interfere with the timetable of the proceedings, so it will be decided by Monday morning.</p>\n<p>Laura Devinere is an interior decorator and on again/off again friend of Amber Heard\u2019s. She was sworn in and confirms her witness statement. The basic gist of her testimony is that she was terrified into signing a statement in support of Johnny Depp due to coercion on the part of Adam Waldman. She says she\u2019s terrified of what Johnny\u2019s lawyers were insinuating they would do to her. She says she didn\u2019t want to get involved and was very uncomfortable giving a statement.</p>\n<p>An interesting note is that the court played a recording of a conversation between LD and Amber that was recorded without LD\u2019s knowledge or consent, which is illegal in the state of California. How many laws does Amber have to break, FFS? In the conversation that was taped, Amber drilled LD about what AW was saying to her, and honestly, it sounds like LD is terrified of Amber Heard, not Adam Waldman.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway from LD seems to be that she was uncomfortable making that statement that she never saw any injuries on Amber Heard because of pressure she was under from Johnny\u2019s team, but nowhere does she say that the statement is untrue in any way. So, while she may still be terrified of Amber, LD stands by her statement.</p>\n<p>Due to previous commitments, that\u2019s all I caught. Apologies.

He\u2019s the security guard that took pictures of Johnny Depp\u2019s face after Amber Heard\u2019s 30th birthday party, when she admittedly punched him in the face. He also helped search for Johnny Depp\u2019s phone after Amber Heard threw it out of the apartment. QC tried to minimalize SB\u2019s interaction with Johnny Depp and his family, so that it would somehow matter less when SB testified that he never saw injuries on Amber Heard. She flat out called SB a liar, but SB said that she could call him a liar a hundred times. It doesn\u2019t change the facts. SB had no problem whatsoever asserting the facts, despite repeatedly having his statements challenged. QC said that they would have to agree to disagree.</p>\n<p>I disagree. We\u2019re not dealing with matters of opinion, here. It doesn\u2019t matter what QC thinks, it matters what she can prove.</p>\n<p>The judge stepping in when QC tried to insinuate that Johnny Depp, as well as SB, were involved in a nightclub incident where a woman says she was roughed up and handcuffed by Johnny Depp\u2019s security, who tried to pass themselves off as police officers.

As such, Amber heard about a horrific incident that had happened in Kate\u2019s life. When she was 26, Kate was raped at machete point for hours and barely escaped with her life.</p>\n<p>And now, we find out that Amber Heard has taken <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec--4AqWoAEHkqm?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\"nofollow\">that story</a> and twisted it around as if it\u2019s her own story.</p>\n<p>I could go on and on about how this is textbook behavior for a narcissistic sociopath, but frankly, I\u2019m too disgusted to look up the references.

So we\u2019ll have to wait and see how similar Amber\u2019s story is to Kates.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I can\u2019t begin to describe how vile it is for Amber to take the single worst moment of a person\u2019s life and use it for her own personal gain. What gain? I can only speculate that she\u2019s going to accuse Johnny of being the one that raped her. I knew she was going to pull something for sympathy when she hit the stand, but I didn\u2019t know that it would be this repugnant.

Oh his honeymoom.</p>\n<p>Moving on to the topic of Australia, QC tried to insinuate that, because of all the different stories that came out, that Amber didn\u2019t chop off Johnny\u2019s finger at all. Maybe Johnny did it himself on that accordion door, which Malcolm insisted is impossible because the door has a safety feature.</p>\n<p>Queen\u2019s Counsel, (QC) also insinuated that Johnny injured Amber despite the fact that she was searing a slip when Malcolm arrived first, and she didn\u2019t have a mark on her. Scratches on her arms didn\u2019t appear until after Jerry Judge, Johnny\u2019s long-time head of security, showed up. In other words, those scratches were more likely than not self-inflicted.</p>\n<p>When QC\u2019s insinuations didn\u2019t sway Malcolm to change his answers, she made it seem that Johnny was on drugs, as usual.</p>\n<p>Redirect clarified that Malcolm simply never saw any injuries on Amber Heard. He, Malcolm, wouldn\u2019t tolerate any man hitting a woman. Not Johnny Depp. Not even the Pope. On the other hand, Malcolm recounts being asked to intervene because Amber heard kept hitting Johnny repeatedly. Malcolm also assures the court that he has not been pressured in any way into testifying on Johnny Depp\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>Tara Roberts, (TR) is Johnny Depp\u2019s Bahamian estate manager. QC started by insinuating that TR relies upon JD for her home and income, so she\u2019d lie for him. TR insists that she\u2019s got other family income. She\u2019d be sad if she lost the job because of all the friends she\u2019s made, but that she wouldn\u2019t be financially devastated. She\u2019s got no reason to lie to keep her job, and wouldn\u2019t anyway.</p>\n<p>QC tried to debunk TR\u2019s statement that Johnny has never been violent toward people by showing that TMZ video. TR wouldn\u2019t change her statement that Johnny isn\u2019t violent or that Amber had no injuries on the island. So, unable to make any headway with her, QC let her off the hook.</p>\n<p>Redirect cleared up that TR never saw Johnny hit or abuse Amber Heard or any other person. And that Amber never showed any injuries. But she did see Amber Heard being violent toward Johnny Depp, causing injuries including a gash across the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>No further questions.</p>\n<p>Samantha MCmillen (SM) is Johnny Depp\u2019s stylist since 2002, for 18 years now. She also worked as a stylist for Amber Heard while she and Johnny were together. SM confirmed what she\u2019s been saying the whole time that when Amber Heard appeared on <a href=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/14/17/depp-court.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">the James Cordon show</a>, she displayed no injuries despite insisting that she had two black eyes.</p>\n<p>Hilda Vargas (HV) has been Johnny Depp\u2019s housekeeper for 30 years.

HV clarified that the dogs have accidents \u201cOn the floor.\u201d Both Pistol and Boo are too small to jump on the bed, and have never had an accident in the bed. She\u2019s cleaned up after Boo many times, so she can say with authority that the poops were too big to have come from him. QC tried to suggest that Amber Heard was already gone for a full day at Coachella before the poop happened, but HV stuck to her story that Johnny was gone, and the poop was fresh. QC says that HV was angry, and HV admits that she felt disrespected to be left a mess like that because this sort of thing hasn\u2019t happened 30 years of Working for Johnny Depp.</p>\n<p>Redirect clarified HV\u2019s statements, and included that HV also saw Amber in May of 2016 without any injuries on her.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/johnny-depp-trial-poop-39.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=840\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Photo of the poop</a> has been released to the media.</p>", "photo": {"id": "224275451", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/7/rn/vc/ARrnvcomQqLMbuC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1594746548", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27259929", "createdAt": "2020-07-11T11:52:04.000Z", "title": "Amber Turd Trending", "description": "<p>Today's update is going to be short and sweet.

Really low blow.</p>\n<p>QC tried to paint Johnny as a drug-addicted monster that walks around in a rage all the time. She failed miserably, because quite simply, that isn\u2019t true.</p>\n<p>QC went into that final night, the one where Amber insists that Johnny threw a cell phone at her face.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to interject here that if you haven\u2019t seen Brian\u2019s videos, be sure to check him out. He debunks her version of events with clear and concise logic that\u2019s infallible. You can find him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>They brought up our little petition in court today. It had been suggested that he had something to do with creating the petition back when Amber Heard was in AM1. Johnny said that the petition came \u201cyears later.\u201d So take heart in knowing that he\u2019s aware of us, my friends.</p>\n<p>After a 5 (or so) session where testimony was given in chambers, David Sherborne (DS) redirected Johnny for an hour before the lunch break and an hour afterward.</p>\n<p>DS asked about the people Johnny surrounds himself with. QC had painted them as yes men who wouldn\u2019t interfere while He was slapping his wife around. DS gave Johnny a chance to testify that such is not true. His entourage wouldn\u2019t stand idly by while such a thing happened, which was never a problem because it never happened.</p>\n<p>The main difference between QC\u2019s cross examination and DS\u2019s redirect is that DS asked questions in a brief and concise manner. And he allowed Johnny to complete his answers instead of cutting him off, which QC did almost constantly. It was a very efficient way of conducting business. In two hours, DS debunked the accusations about Johnny\u2019s violent nature that QC spent 3.5 days trying to construct.</p>\n<p>Also debunked were the accusations that Johnny acquired massive amounts of drugs for only himself. Amber Heard\u2019s medical records of the time showed that she had, indeed, ingested or otherwise used (abused?) drugs, including some that Johnny doesn\u2019t even use.</p>\n<p>After Johnny was let out of the hot seat, officer Melissa Saenz testified via video uplink. This is one of the officers that responded the night of that last, final fight of the marriage, the one where Amber insisted that Johnny threw a phone at her face and otherwise roughed her up.</p>\n<p>QC tried to insist that OMS didn\u2019t get a very good look at Amber\u2019s face, and that there were injuries to Amber\u2019s face that OMS missed, or didn\u2019t see, or whatever. But OMS remained completely certain that she did get a very good look at Amber, and that there were no marks. There were no signs of violence whatsoever, on Amber or at the scene.</p>\n<p>Like she did with Johnny, QC pulled the tactic of calling OMS a liar and interjecting her own scenario. But OMS weathered it brilliantly and refused to change her account of the evening.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure what QC thought she was going to get away with, trying to call OMS a liar. OMS is a trained professional, an expert in domestic violence. But all she succeeded in doing was making herself look foolish.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s about all I caught from today. More as I hear about it.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I simply don\u2019t see how Johnny can\u2019t come out on top. Where the defense had nothing but \u201csuggestions\u201d and self-imposed testimony, the offense \u2013 Johnny\u2019s team \u2013 has receipts for everything. Medical records and whatever else they need to prove their side of the case. I think it\u2019s a slam dunk.</p>\n<p>Next up: Probably updates about how Amber Heard is out until late/early every morning partying it up, seeming to take none of this seriously.

Today, she addressed two incidents of what she called violence against Amber Heard at the hands of Johnny Depp.</p>\n<p>First, QC talked about what happened in Australia when Johnny lost the tip of his finger. QC badgered Johnny with Amber\u2019s ever-changing version of events. Now, Amber\u2019s saying that she slept through the night and morning when Johnny chopped off his own finger and trashed the house \u2013 though she did make a statement in documents that she\u2019s the one that broke the TV, belying her story that she woke up in the morning to find all this horror.</p>\n<p>Johnny held his own, though, giving answers that were at times humorous and I daresay sassy. It was refreshing to see that he adamantly refuses to let Amber\u2019s team get away with her fictional version of events.</p>\n<p>It was rather horrifying, though, to see Johnny describe how the bone was sticking out of his devastated finger, and being so ruined himself that he did indeed write on the walls and mirrors in his own blood.</p>\n<p>The judge and Johnny\u2019s counsel were heard from a lot more today, objecting when QC stepped out of line, giving Johnny more of a chance to answer questions without being interrupted. Not that there were many questions. It was more like QC giving testimony and interrupting Johnny when he tried to answer to the fictional charges she was laying out.</p>\n<p>QC also described the incident in the penthouse where Amber Heard said she hit Johnny for the first (and only?) time, in defense of her sister Whitney. Amber insists that Johnny was pushing Whitney around to try to get at Amber to abuse her. Johnny patently denied that version of events the same way he denies her version of all of these events.</p>\n<p>As court wrapped up, it became known that Johnny\u2019s lawyer will have an hour to redirect \u2013 to question Johnny again about certain points that QC addressed during her cross examination. I think that\u2019s good. After being raked over the coals for three days, Johnny will get a chance to set the record straight.</p>\n<p>On another amusing note, it seems that our little petition has been mentioned in court documents.

She needs to know that actions have consequences, and it\u2019s not always consequences you can control. She seems to be the type that likes to be in control, but she can\u2019t control the petition, and she will never control me.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s about it for today.

He won't admit to it because he never did it.

I\u2019d be here all day. Suffice it to say that she tortured him and nearly killed him on several occasions.</p>\n<p>It does bear mentioning that it's not just Johnny that was affected by Heard's actions. His children were often in the house during these incidents and witnessed the immediate aftermath.</p>\n<p>And there have been other victims of Amber\u2019s wrath. Kate James, Heard\u2019s former personal assistant, has come forward with horrifying and heartbreaking stories <a href=\"https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-amber-heard-abuse-assistant-kate-james-lawsuit-drugs-mental-verbal-trial\" rel=\"nofollow\">of\u00a0the way she was treated</a>\u00a0at Amber Heard\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201dAmber was regularly verbally and mentally abusive and would often scream at me in that way, over the smallest things. She would fly into blind rages where no-one could reason with her, and even if I was trying to offer an explanation, I didn\u2019t think that she could hear me as she was so angry. It was like she thought regular things that can go wrong in any person\u2019s life on any given day didn\u2019t apply to her. Everything that went wrong was always my fault. I remember one occasion where she missed a connection on a flight on or around Christmas Day in 2012. My aunt was visiting from Australia at that time. She was screaming abuse at me for literally hours as though I had made it snow and caused the disruptions to the flight.\u201d</p>\n<p>One time, Amber Heard took James\u2019\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/winonasrider/status/1237872412080795649?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">4 year old son</a>\u00a0to use as a human prop in a photo shoot. If I recall correctly, Heard drove with the tiny toddler in the front seat without any restraint. Jame\u2019s was horrified and couldn\u2019t get her son away from Heard fast enough.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7743993/Amber-Heards-father-threatened-SHOOT-Johnny-Depp-witness-testifies-actors-defamation-suit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Killackey</a>, who was reportedly threatened and sexually harassed by Amber Heard. David, who worked on both Heard and Depp's classic cars, claimed that Heard was\u00a0abusive toward him\u00a0and that her father, David Heard, made 'death threats' toward Depp in a phone call. Killackey said the abuse began after he told Heard that all work on the cars would have to be paid directly, rather than through Depp's management.\u00a0\u201cThe reply I received was to verbally abuse me with expletives, threats and a continued rant over what she claimed was an unfortunate financial downturn of her personal finances caused by Mr. Depp. At one point she said \"you motherf***er, you're screwing me!\"</p>\n<p>Another time, Heard asked Killackey to show her something in her car. Then, when they were both inside, Heard said suggestively that they were alone down there and that \u201canything could happen.\u201d Killackey immediately exited the vehicle, spurning her advances, and that she became unpleasant after that.</p>\n<p>Killackey said that he stopped communicating with Heard directly after a 'very unpleasant' call, and soon began to hear from her father instead.\u00a0During one phone call about the repairs, David Heard allegedly told Killackey: 'That f***ing piece of s*** is f***ing me too because I'm supposed to get 10 percent of the money and without it I can't produce the movie I was gunna make!\u201d David Heard went on to say: 'When I get to him I'm going to beat the s*** out of him' and 'I'm from Texas, and men from Texas carry 45's and Johnny is going to meet the f***ing end of mine!' Killackey claimed.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Killackey reported the threats to the police.</p>\n<p>Apparently, that apple didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.</p>\n<p>The point, here, is that it\u2019s Amber Heard is the one that has a history of abusive behavior, not Johnny Depp. No matter how much smoke and mirrors she throws up to make it look like Johnny is the one who was violent, there is simply no getting away from the history of her own actions. And, soon enough, she\u2019ll end up paying for them. He tacky little web is falling apart around her, and she\u2019s got nowhere left to hide.</p>\n<p>I, for one, can\u2019t wait to see her finally meet her Karma.

He would never do such a thing. He said so in the very same text.</p>\n<p>But Amber's likely won't play it that way. I'm willing to bet real money that she's going to show up and use that text to portray herself as a victim who was afraid for her very life. \"He was planning to KILL me!\" She'll probably testify, dabbing at the corner of her eye with a tissue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her testimony will have no bearing on the Sun case, because nothing can change the fact that Amber is the one who abused Johnny. No. What she's doing is setting up her testimony so that it will be a matter of record, so that she can use it in Johnny's defamation suit against her.</p>\n<p>She plays the long game, let's not forget. She took \"damning\" photos and set herself up as the victim for probably the entirety of their relationship, knowing what she was ultimately going to do. I wouldn't doubt that the same thing is going on here.</p>\n<p>The other reason the I can think of for her to show up and testify is to try to rattle Johnny, who will most likely be there. It's possible that she wants him to see her and fall to pieces, lose his resolve, or make a mistake and say something stupid.</p>\n<p>Think about how crazy stupid in love with her he was. Is that really gone from within him? Or does he still have a soft spot for his \"made up\" ex wife? Could he see her, go all mushy and drop the defamation case?</p>\n<p>I don't think so.</p>\n<p>Four years is a long time, and a lot of things can happen. One of those things is that Johnny has recovered himself. He's gotten back who he is, and he's steeled his resolve to defend himself against allegations that just aren't true. Seeing her isn't going to make him lose that. If anything, seeing her will strengthen his resolve.</p>\n<p>I'd love to know what you guys think about why Amber Heard plans to show up in London next month to testify in the Sun case. Drop and comment and let me know what you think.</p>", "photo": {"id": "223184695", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/5/wh/fb/orwhfBVgKPWkWfT-800x450-noPad.jpg?1583261273", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "25831906", "createdAt": "2020-03-02T20:19:11.000Z", "title": "Steven Spielberg's daughter jailed for domestic abuse.", "description": "<p>Mikaela Spielberg, Steven <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mikaela-spielberg-tearful-mug-shot-domestic-violence-arrest-192238648.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spielberg's daughter has been jailed</a> for domestic assault with bodily injury after a physical fight with her fiance.</p>\n<p>The two were out drinking, and a heated argument developed.

While claiming to be representatives of abused women, the MeToo platform has created an environment where men can be persecuted with no proof whatsoever aside of a woman accusing him, the way Amber Heard accused her ex-husband Johnny Depp of abusing her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heard presented falsified photos as proof, and she became the darling of #MeToo, furthering her own career and public reputation at the cost of a man who did none of the things she accused him of.</p>\n<p>Heard's photos were quickly debunked as fakes by other public photos the day before, the day after, and even later the same day showing her with no bruises or busted lip at all.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, women like this don't represent women who really have been brutalized.
