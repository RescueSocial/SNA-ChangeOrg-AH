Support a Traffic light in front of Red Bank Regional High School.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,25106366,2019-09-23T13:17:54.000Z,Remember Safety over Speed!,"<p>Please remember, this light is about the safety of the students and community not about leaving the lot parking lot faster.  Yes, the the light might slow things down a bit but there are still many people needing to turn left onto Ridge Road after the Officer leaves.  The light will help with control the flow and will help those people still in the lot when there is no one directing traffic.  It is a Safety Issue rather than a Speed Issue.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has signed our petition so far.  Please continue to share until the light becomes a reality.</p>
