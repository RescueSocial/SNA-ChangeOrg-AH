Such women can cause imprisonment and even suicide of their targets.</p>\n<p>Given the incitement to \u201c#BelieveWomen,\u201d all women wield that weapon, and all men are vulnerable to it.</p>\n<p>All men are not bad and all women are not good; and, the notion that all women are powerless victims is phantastic.</p>\n<p>Proof of women\u2019s power (and not always benevolent intentions) is clearly demonstrated in Amber Heard\u2019s ill-treatment of Johnny Depp. And, if you're not a rich and powerful man like Johnny Depp you don't stand a chance against such cruel accusations.</p>\n<p>Similarly, guilty or not, it appears a politically motivated third party with no firsthand knowledge of an alleged incident of sexual impropriety wagged a dirty finger at Musk, who may have been extorted.<br>\u00a0 \u00a0<br><strong>We need prosecutors with the courage to charge and indict malicious false accusers, all of whom need to be held accountable and suffer serious consequences, just like their victims.</strong><br><br>We need more Johnny Depp/Amber Heard like scandals televised for all to see. No longer a he said, she said without proof and evidence. But, an opportunity to see behind closed doors and sort fact from fiction in pursuit of truth and justice.</p>\n<p>Malicious false accusers need to be held criminally accountable and go to jail. If Amber Heard maliciously accused Johnny Depp, will she soon be behind bars? If so, we know of some proverbial high and dry land in Florida in which you might be interested.</p>\n<p>Over a year ago, as a counter measure to such hurtful accusations, NCFM started our chapter Women Against False Accusations.</p>\n<p><strong>This September, join us for a rally in Washington D.C.
