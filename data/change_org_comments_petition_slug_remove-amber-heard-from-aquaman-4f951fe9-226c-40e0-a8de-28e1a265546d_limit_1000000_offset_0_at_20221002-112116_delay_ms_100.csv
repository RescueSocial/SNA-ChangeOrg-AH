Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, which is demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman film project entirely. <br>The entertainment industry must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, which is demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

833541730,Johnny Depp was removed from Fantastic Beast because of her accusation which was proven false. She was kept in Aquaman and her role has been been given more screen time after she was proven to be lying. I among so many other will not be going to theaters to watch Aguaman. It is a shame that the other actors in the movie will suffer because Warner Brothers will bot remove her. It was leaked that the reason her character is in the hospital is because she had a baby with Aguaman. You don't need to keep her character just because of that.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, which is demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman film project entirely. <br>The entertainment industry must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, which is demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman film project entirely. <br>The entertainment industry must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>
<p>Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Amber Heard, actress and victim of sexual, domestic and narcissistic violence and a media witch hunt worldwide

What Johnny Depp, his lawyers, lots of media and social media, his so-called friends are doing here is a misogynistic witch hunt and a global slap in the face to all victims of violence, female and male. While the victim is showered with scorn, hatred and threats, the perpetrator is frenetically celebrated as a hero and victim.
Here in Germany we also have an opinion and we see things differently than America, which is obviously incredibly misogynistic. A lot of people who see this are tired of going to America or watching any movies with misogynistic full drug and alcohol addicted narcissistic American male jerks and I mean that seriously. We in Germany are sick of your disgusting witch hunts and misogyny and the day of days is coming when your misdeeds will fall back on you.
I don't think much of America anymore, we're not in the Middle Ages, where innocent people were tortured and burned as witches. So honestly, is it still possible?Can we now herald the end of Metoo after so many people around the world are literally spitting on a victim of violence and hounding them to death. Where is the women's movement in America, where are the human rights of women in America? Likely disappeared in the new witch trial of a woman in America, instigated by a psychopathic narcissist and believe it or not, by millions of female and male supporters, including courts and attorneys. And in the 21st century, to say most normal people are pissed off here is an understatement.
It's a lesson in misogyny: the hate campaign against Amber Heard. There are a lot of things happening in the world right now that demand our attention and outrage. A multi-billionaire who presents himself as an icon of ""free speech"" wants to silence a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment. Global warming has reached a point of no return, but serious environmental protection is just a little too uncomfortable for the super-rich and industrialized nations. In the United States, killing sprees and terrorist attacks are now happening every week. And then there is the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, which has meanwhile joined the misery that we have learned to accept with a shrug of the shoulders.
However, when it comes to Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, all of this news seems secondary. The eye of the online public is on the court case between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, which is currently taking place in Fairfax, Virginia. The background can actually be told quickly: Amber Heard published a feminist article in the Washington Post in December 2018, in which she wrote, among other things: “Two years ago I became a public figure representing domestic violence; and I felt the full brunt of our culture's hatred of women speaking out publicly.” Heard had split from her husband Johnny Depp at the time; the split came with a domestic violence restraining order and she was photographed with bruises on her face.
The British tabloid ""Sun"" described Johnny Depp as a ""wife beater"". The Hollywood star went to court in 2020 - and has now suffered a deserved defeat there. The judge in charge ruled that the information in the text of the Sun was ""essentially true"". That's why Depp's lawsuit was dismissed.
Do you think this man would finally have calmed down? If all violent, controlling and raping men are now allowed to sue their victims, where are we going? Nobody thought of that among the women who support Depp because of his supposed good looks and his charm, and also like his ex-wives out of cowardice. Powerful men and men in general are always right, who is going to report a perpetrator anymore? In this way, female, male and child victims are silenced by perpetrators. Female betrayal is evident in two of Johnny Depp's ex-girlfriends who also broke up with him, have been called cunts by him and now claim he was a wonderful man. Honestly, I would like to see into the brains of the ladies, did they get so much money from him that they say something like this, even though they know full well that the trial is against all victims, not just against Amber Heard. If Heard loses, we all lose and Metoo is a thing of the past!
I can't hear these constant victim accusations and non-stop abuser apologies anymore. If you think only men blame female victims, think again. Often the women with accusations are even more extreme and insulting. Who hasn't had that happen to you, you become a victim of catcalling on the street, other women say, my God you're sensitive, you just don't listen. Or your classmate, colleague, boss sexually harassed you, many women scream right away, honestly, you didn't provoke them, men don't do it for no reason. A female relative is beaten up badly by her husband, often with children, most women scream right away, yes, this woman deserves it, she and her children must be cheeky. A female friend is gang raped, female sympathy, non-existent, they say, honestly, doesn't she look like a slut and doesn't she deserve it? A woman is being stalked, women are immediately screaming in chorus, yes, you must have had an affair with the guy, it's your own fault, otherwise he wouldn't be so fixated on you... And so on and so on...
Together women are strong. Together we make a change. Together we triumph!
If you are a survivor of sexual and domestic violence, rape and abuse, psychic terror and sadistic stalking, be proud of yourself. Because you have survived, in spite of everything, with all your courage, strength and bravery.
If sexual and domestic violence, sexual slavery, rape and domestic homicide and sex murder continue to be trivialized worldwide and remain almost unpunished, we need not be surprised that women, girls, female children and female babies around the world are experiencing a global cruel genocide. A female holocaust that threatens the future of humanity: Sexual and domestic crimes, murders and femicide must punished with the strictest penalties in the world, otherwise one day there will be no more women in the world and that will be very soon!
Don't tell women, girls and female childs how to dress and look beautiful. It's more important to tell them to learn to defend themselves and to fight. The day may come, that this saves their lives. Self defense is a human right and human rights are women right's.
The emergence of the #MeToo movementin the aftermath of the scandals surrounding movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and television personalities Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly has led to a rise in public scrutiny over the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements in settlements. These agreements can be incredibly pernicious contracts when they are used to silence sexual abuse. Allowing victims to speak out is a necessary form of prevention because it exposes the pattern of abuse, warns those who might become victims, and encourages others similarly situated to come forward with their own claims.
The silence, secrecy and shame that surrounds victims and survivors of child sexual assault are the
offender’s best friend and our children’s worst enemy. Silence and secrecy are always the facilitator,
rarely the solution. Criminalising a victim/survivor’s right to speak out and break their silence, to
identify themselves as a victim of sexual harm not only perpetuates the harm, disempowerment and fear
experienced by survivors but it is a breach of the their human rights. This response can cause just as
much harm as the offending itself. Victims of sexual assault have had so much taken from them by the
offender, to then have a system further strip them of their rights to have a voice, to share their story
without shame, to regain control of their lives, can have serious unintended adverse impacts.
Our demand worldwide must be:
Perpetrators of abuse are held accountable!
They are not to retain positions of power or authority, they must demonstrate they are able to function without perpetuating abuse, rape, coercive or controlling behaviours.
Victim-Survivors of rape and sexual violence must be supported and not held responsible for the behaviours of rapists, predators and abusers.
Victim surviours should have the right to speak out about their sexual assault and rape without fear of legal repuccusion.
The ever growing momentum behind feminist movements has encouraged women to speak up and demand for equal rights. This progress should not go unrecognised, as women are beginning to receive more opportunities, respect, protection and empowerment. However, one ongoing oppressive tendency includes the silencing of women.
I believe that the endless silencing of women can be explained by assessing the structure of society. The capitalist and patriarchal society, which can be found all around the globe, depends on women remaining silent in order for its existence. When women remain silent, society can be complicit and oppression can continue.
I'm a trade unionist and women's rights activist and I know what I'm talking about. I was also tried to be silenced online, with defamation and hate campaigns, sexual deepfakes, identity theft and hacker attacks, with threats of murder and rape online. But I won't keep quiet, because if we keep quiet, the perpetrators won. Of course it's dangerous. Life in the womb is already dangerous for female people, because how many female fetuses are aborted worldwide, isn't it? If we don't fight back, we've already lost.
We must say enough. It’s time to End the Silence on Sexual and Gender Based  Violence.
-Anita Kanitz, trade unionist
 
“over and over victims are blamed for their assaults. and when we imply that victims bring on their own fates - whether to make ourselves feel more efficacious or to make the world seem just - we prevent ourselves from taking the necessary precautions to protect ourselves. Why take precautions? We deny the trauma could easily have happened to us. And we also hurt the people already traumatized. Victims are often already full of self-doubt, and we make recovery harder by laying inspectors blame on them.”
― Anna C. Salter, Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, And Other Sex Offenders
“From New Delhi to New York, from Durban to Rio; women and
girls are been hunted down by rapists, abused by pedophiles and
emotionally decapitated by a society that is becoming increasingly
hostile to the womenfolk”

There are many crimes against women, girls and female childs: Domestic and sexual violence, street harassment, workplace harassment, catcalling, Eve teasing, taharrush gamea, rape culture, mass and gang rapes, war rapes, child rapes, marital rapes, dowry murder, forced and child marriages, FGM, sex slavery, women, girls and child trafficking, forced prostitution, rape pornography, online harassment, sadistic stalking, domestic and sexual murder, acid attacks, femicide, female infanticide, daily hate speech and sexism, sadistic and forced sexual practices, lack of freedom, education and human rights, forced dress codes like chador and burqa, victim blaming of assault, stalking, bullying and rape victims,witch hunts, widow murders, executions like stoning for rape and assault victims, imprisonment and punishment of female victims..
Violence against women, girls and female childs - particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence - are major public health problems and violations of women's human rights and childrens rights..
Recent global prevalence figures indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.
Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (30%) of women who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.
Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.
Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health, and may increase vulnerability to HIV.
Factors associated with increased risk of perpetration of violence include low education, child maltreatment or exposure to violence in the family, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality.
Factors associated with increased risk of experiencing intimate partner and sexual violence include low education, exposure to violence between parents, abuse during childhood, attitudes accepting violence and gender inequality.
There is evidence from high-income settings that school-based programmes may be effective in preventing relationship violence (or dating violence) among young people.
In low-income settings, primary prevention strategies, such as microfinance combined with gender equality training and community-based initiatives that address gender inequality and relationship skills, hold promise.
Situations of conflict, post conflict and displacement may exacerbate existing violence, such as by intimate partners, and present additional forms of violence against women.
Global violence uniquely affects the girl child. Although international legal instruments have been in place for decades to protect the girl child, thousands of brutal acts of violence and neglect specifically targeting the girl child can be observed around the world on a daily basis. For centuries, girls who have barely attained adolescence have been forced into marriage, often with men many years their senior. As a minor, a girl child cannot legally give her consent to enter into such a partnership. They have suffered in female genital mutilation rituals. They are traded, bought, and sold across national borders as commodities to be put to use as prostitutes or slaves, or merely to be sold again at a profit. Many girls are even victimized before birth, as technology and greater access to medicine have given rise to prenatal sex selection and selection abortion based on sex. Girls continue to face the threat of sexual harassment and abuse in workplaces and schools. Their lives may be taken for the “honor” of their families for speaking to strangers or committing other minor transgressions. Violence against the girl child has become a powerful and all-too-common tactic in times of war and humanitarian disaster.
 That is the reason why I am fighting my whole life for human rights, women and girls rights and children's rights. But it is not enough, day by day the world is getting a more dangerous and barbaric place for childs, girls and women! And the greatest danger on earth for all of us are the male humans, what a shame for humankind!
Femicide, misogyny, stalking, sexual violence, rape culture, hate speech is everywhere!
We don't want to use the term ‘harassment.’ What is happening today is sexual terrorism.
A strong woman stands up for herself. A stronger woman stands up for everyone else.

""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.""
-Albert Einstein, German-born theoretical physicist
 
“Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It shouldn’t be that women are the exception.”
“Every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is, although we didn’t have a name for it.”
“Feminism is the notion that we should each be free to develop our own talents and not be held back by man made barriers.”
-Ruth Ginsburg,  American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in 2020.
 
We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as in the media daily is shown with many cases and examples, of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, gang rapes, sexual harassment and sexual murder, femicide, FGM, child and forced marriages,dowry murder and witch hunts on the social media and so and so on.
Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.
And the worst thing worldwide is victim blaming:
I can't hear these constant victim accusations and non-stop abuser apologies anymore. If you think only men blame female victims, think again. Often the women with accusations are even more extreme and insulting. Who hasn't had that happen to you, you become a victim of catcalling on the street, other women say, my God you're sensitive, you just don't listen. Or your classmate, colleague, boss sexually harassed you, many women scream right away, honestly, you didn't provoke them, men don't do it for no reason. A female relative is beaten up badly by her husband, often with children, most women scream right away, yes, this woman deserves it, she and her children must be cheeky. A female friend is gang raped, female sympathy, non-existent, they say, honestly, doesn't she look like a slut and doesn't she deserve it? A woman is being stalked, women are immediately screaming in chorus, yes, you must have had an affair with the guy, it's your own fault, otherwise he wouldn't be so fixated on you... And so on and so on..
End this nonsence  and this hate against women, girls and female childs forever, that is a shame for the whole male humankind and in the future when Herstory is written, the humans in the future can read about the crimes and the shame of the male human apes.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

<p>And who am I? I am a male witness to a male client who was abused by his female (physically healthy) partner. My male client was a tetraplegic, in a wheelchair. And my experience, when I couldn't do anything but only report the abuse I was hearing for several assignments 3-4 weeks per assignment, not ever knowing when is the domestic abuse going to happen again. <br>It was mentally challenging. Someone might think, it can not affect you. Yes, it can. And yes it does. It can get under your skin, into your mind - because you naturally want to help the person, you want to be the change they (the victim) don't believe they can be. <br>It was one of the most exhausting, energy-draining times I have experienced. </p>

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision.

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, which is demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman film project entirely. <br>The entertainment industry must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>
<p>Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>

Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman

The latest photo, audio, and video evidence, court testimonies, and years of community thorough analysis indisputably show that years of Ambers's allegations that Johnny Depp is the abuser, are INCORRECT, in some cases FABRICATED, and UNTRUE. 

Wrongly accused Johnny Depp has, for this reason, due to untrue allegations of Amber Heard, suffered for over 4 years without work. His movie projects were stopped, halted, or suspended. And because of domestic abuse by Amber Heard, he suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

Audio and video evidence show that Amber Heard has been abusing Johnny Depp. And Johnny Depp was the victim of domestic violence and abuse. 

If a man is seen as the abuser, he is removed and cut out from movies, shots are retaken and the movie is reproduced. And the same consequences should face a woman if she is the abuser of domestic violence. 
The whole world is watching you. Your success or your failure will depend on your decision. 

Please see the attached evidence below for yourself.

Based on the evidence we have seen, we ask that you REMOVE Amber Heard from Aquaman and Aquaman 2.
The community around the world will not tolerate domestic abuse and nor, should you? 
Domestic abuse is genderless.
