<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

833118196,I truly believe Johnny Depp is innocent. Regardless of the jury's outcome because they don't have access to the audio of AmberHeard admitting to cutting off Johnny's finger so Idk if I'm going to believe justice is real if Johnny doesn't win this case. Adam Waldman is a friend the whole world should get to enjoy he's the right kind of people who does the right thing even when the odds are against him. I don't know about you but I'd rather have a trustworthy Adam Waldman as a friend than someone like Amber that lies under oath as if the whole world can't see she just lied! Amber plotted to kill Depp on text message with Josh she has made up this horrible hoax with her friends then when Adam Waldman who should have the same rights as me saw this unjust he did whatever he did but he didn't break laws he was attacked by Ambers people & they did everything they could to try to hurt him. My tweeting with Wald minions is about what Amber said not what Waldman said I don't even know what Waldman said anyway but that guy in court tried to put that on Waldman too and that's not right my actions don't belong to Johnny or Waldman I'm mad at Amber because she lied about being abused that's just crazy who does that? Amber Heard is a liar she is a abuser she is evil and Adam Waldman shouldn't be punished because Ambers hoax was caught We need to punish Amber to teach her real life isn't a movie & there are consequences in real life for people like that.

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>

<p>According to messages obtained by YouTuber ThatUmbrellaGuy and released with Waldman’s permission, Depp’s attorney first reached out to Twitter near immediately following his April 20th suspension.</p>
<p>In his first message to a member of Twitter’s administration team, Waldman asserted that two of his colleagues had contacted the site about opening a verified account for Depp and overturning Waldman’s own suspension, only for them to allegedly inform Waldman that they had not received a response from the social media platform.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that my account be reinstated,” wrote Waldman. “And I would also like to be verified which, as I understand it, makes this less likely to occur in the future.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, Twitter seemingly responded to one of Waldman’s aforementioned colleagues regarding the opening of a verified account for Depp “but not a word about” Waldman’s, which prompted the attorney to further request “a response about my suspended Twitter account please”.</p>
<p>“No email has been sent to me explaining why despite repeated promises,” Waldman added. “No notice was given. No reason was provided. Perhaps my suspension was a mistake that Twitter intends to remedy. Perhaps it is something else, and I will need to take other action.”</p>
<p>Again receiving no response, Waldman sent a third message regarding “setting up a verified Twitter account for my client Johnny Depp” and “unsuspending my Twitter account, which was shut down without any of Twitter’s procedures and process, including notice, expression of basis, and what to do.”</p>
<p>“When does this suspension end?” Waldman proceeded to ask. “Does something need to be filed to end it? Why was I singled out and treated differently regarding notice than any other suspended account? In the meantime, my voice is silenced.”</p>
<p>Finally, Twitter would respond, explaining to Waldman that they had confirmed “receipt of your correspondence” and had “asked the relevant team to look into your case,” promising to “be back in touch after the weekend with any update.”</p>
<p>As for Depp’s account, Twitter suggested “we get-together to talk through the on-boarding &amp; launch strategy.”</p>
<p>However, Waldman soon found himself once again allegedly ignored by the social media platform, a development which led him to send an additional follow-up email regarding his suspension.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Waldman’s follow-up did not receive a response, a silence which in turn led to him sending yet another message to Twitter.</p>
<p>“No reason was provided despite repeated promises to do so,” a frustrated Waldman stated. “And there can be no reason; I did not violate Twitter policies in any respect. I post only public legal documents, news articles and occasionally cultural references like song lyrics to show the truth of a public matter. I express no personal opinion outside the 4 corners of those public documents.”</p>
<p>Finally, following this last message, Waldman received a response from Twitter. In their message, Twitter informed Waldman “that your account was suspended due to multiple violations of our private information policy.”</p>
