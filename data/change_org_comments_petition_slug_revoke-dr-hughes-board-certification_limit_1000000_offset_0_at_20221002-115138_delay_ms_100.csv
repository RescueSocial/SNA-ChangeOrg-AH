832647194,"As confirmed in her testimony, Dr Hughes is happy to promote any violent domestic abuser like Amber Heard - for her eye-watering rate of $500 USD an hour! She also confirmed she is regularly hired by Heard's attorneys to testify to whatever twisted narrative they dictate. Her heinous, 100% unproven abuse allegations against Johnny Depp were unprofessional, totally biased and amply demonstrate her low calibre as a practitioner and a human being. There's no question Amber Heard put Johnny Depp in hospital, was witnessed (and admitted to) punching him in the face, and vilely defecated in his bed. This is the dangerous abuser Dr Hughes laughably calls a 'victim'!
