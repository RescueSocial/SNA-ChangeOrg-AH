He is the victim. Disney has just announced he won't be returning for Piartes of the Caribbean, a franchise he has been carrying on his back since 2003.  Yet she is still allowed to keep all of her jobs.  It is not right and never will be.  You tell people to speak out and when they do stuff like this happens and people loose everything they have worked for. The fact that all his exes are coming forward to support him too and  people still dont believe him. Hes such a good hearted human being. It’s not fair. amber ADMITTED to abusing him and starting physical fights. It makes me absolutely livid knowing that he lost his case.
