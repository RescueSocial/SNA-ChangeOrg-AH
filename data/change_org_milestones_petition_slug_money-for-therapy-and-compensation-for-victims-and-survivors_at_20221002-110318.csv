StarterPetitionUpdate,21868255,2017-11-01T11:35:04.000Z,Peadophiles need therapy not jail - but maybe victims and survivors should come first???,"Dear Supporters, 

This is a Daily Mail article that I MUST send to you. 

After all, victims need therapy first to heal the damage done to them! 

Perpetrators are second in line, as they need therapy to PREVENT more violence! 

Jail is obviously NOT the answer. Anybody who's had the experience of being arrested by Police will concur! That as a first stage, then a potential court case, and then jail. No. As a species we know better! 

Yours still without pension and with a Return to Bail date on 11 November, because I was too successful at exposing organised child abuse online, where Police are among the named abusers! 

With deep sighs and high hopes,

A lot of time has passed and thus awareness has grown: 

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse keeps listening, but survivors have left, for they felt they were not sufficiently heard and abusers were not sufficiently prosecuted. See
https://www.shirleyoakssurvivorsassociation.co.uk/news

Instead, the internet has helped more and more people to wake up to the Great Disillusionment: the elite is NOT what it pretends to be or is painted to be by mainstream media. 

Given Corruption in Police, Court and among Civil Servants, as described by Bent Lawyers and Cops, healing and therapy is the most important answer for everybody who defies victimisation. 

Do visit this Eventbrite page that describes in detail the Canadian therapist Sandra Fecht who developed techniques that apply to all deep Post Traumatic Stress Disorders:

So, this is just to share this special news, trusting that you are waking up your way, hopefully without suffering too much...

StarterPetitionUpdate,18019217,2016-10-01T13:21:22.000Z,Don’t cancel the child abuse inquiry. No matter how much it’s hurt us survivors.,"Dear Supporters, 

It seems that the general outrage about child abuse wants 'justice' for the perpetrators. 

This petition is asking for compensation and therapy for the victims. 

And this article was written by a 'survivor with shrapnel' who deserves to be heard: 
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-survivors-children-theresa-may

He hopes that the Prime Minister will read his article... We are adding: 

Dear Prime Minister, 

When you were Home Secretary you wrote: 

""Child abuse in the UK runs far deeper than you know"": 
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/child-abuse-in-the-uk-runs-far-deeper-than-you-know/

What will you do now?

Will you focus on compensation and therapy for survivors, since it's clearly too embarrassing to name and shame the perpetrators? 

Will you move from collecting papers to LISTENING and HEARING survivors? 

If not you, who?

If not now, when? 

Thank You for shining Light into the ""darkness in our midst.""
