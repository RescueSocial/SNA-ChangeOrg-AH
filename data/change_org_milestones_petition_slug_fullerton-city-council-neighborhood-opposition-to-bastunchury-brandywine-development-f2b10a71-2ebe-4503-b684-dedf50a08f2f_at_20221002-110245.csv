<p>Jan Flory, Jennifer Fitzgerald, Ahmad Zahra and Jesus Silva voted in favor of this development without any further conditions or research. They basically said we are lucky it is only 33 units.</p>
<p>The only thing they did was make a motion to discuss Bastanchury's general safety at a further date. They also encouraged Brandywine to stay in contact with the school on a monthly basis over dust and noise disturbances but did not require them to physically monitor air quality which some parents were very concerned about. </p>
<p>Make sure you show up at the polls if you are disappointed with this outcome. </p>
<p>All the best, Kelly </p>",,,,
