Together with the 220 children already transferred, this will bring the total to 480 children. However, it has been confirmed that there will be no further increase to this number.\n\nA fund of \u00a33.6m will be allocated to working with France on projects that support genuine claims through the Dublin family reunification process. We understand this will significantly reduce the current disproportionate amount of time it takes to reunite a child refugee in France with their family here in the UK, which is great news. It is also intended that those with no prospect of transferring to the UK be informed of their options.\n\nThe two governments have committed to a strengthening of cooperation on operation of the Dublin Regulation, under which asylum-seekers are compelled to apply for asylum in the first member state in which they land. This will include shorter timescales for decisions and for transfers.\n\nwww.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-01-19/HCWS415/", "photo": {"id": "216470465", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/1/vv/ad/rWvVADmTCBnHzju-800x450-noPad.jpg?1517407500", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "22280570", "createdAt": "2018-01-22T12:56:57.000Z", "signatureCount": 8000}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "22270055", "createdAt": "2018-01-19T19:56:40.000Z", "title": "AMBER RUDD CONCEDES ON CHILD REFUGEES\u2019 ELIGIBILITY FOR DUBS", "description": "We are absolutely thrilled to hear that, after almost two years of incredible public pressure, another arbitrary restriction on child refugees\u2019 eligibility for the Dubs Amendment has been lifted.\n\nChildren were previously required to have registered in France, Greece or Italy before 20th March 2016, in order to be considered for transfer. This left thousands of lone children at risk, as new arrivals were ineligible for safe passage to the UK.\n\nToday, Amber Rudd has announced that \u201cFrance, Greece and Italy will now be able to refer unaccompanied children who arrived in Europe before 18 January 2018\u201d for transfer under the Dubs Amendment \u2013 and that the remaining 260 places would be filled \u201cas soon as possible\u201d!\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the UK Government has committed \u00a33.6 million to working with French authorities in order to identify people who are eligible for family reunion under the Dublin Regulation.\n\nWe want to say an enormous thank you to everyone who has campaigned for this \u2013 from the hundreds of thousands who have signed petitions, to those who have joined us outside Parliament and the Royal Court of Justice, to every person who spread the word in solidarity with child refugees.\n\nThis would not have happened without you.
