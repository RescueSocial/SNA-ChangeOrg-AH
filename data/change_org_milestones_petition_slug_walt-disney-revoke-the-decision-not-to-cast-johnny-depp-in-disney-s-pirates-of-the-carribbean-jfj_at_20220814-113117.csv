StarterPetitionUpdate,28044434,2020-11-10T16:11:57.000Z,,The Sun has no morality - please share,"<p>Please share this petition, and thank you all for your support!</p>
<p>The Sun have a reputation for falsely reporting media with an agenda and completely fabricating stories. </p>
<p>It seems this monopoly Rupert Murdoch has over the media is completely corrupted.</p>
<p><em>Keith Rupert Murdoch is an Australian-born American media giant. Through his company News Corp, he is the owner of hundreds of local, national, and international publishing outlets around the world, including The Sun and The Times in the UK, The Daily Telegraph and The Australian in Australia, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post in the US, book publisher HarperCollins, and the television broadcasting channels Sky News Australia and Fox News (through the Fox Corporation). He was also the owner of Sky (until 2018), 21st Century Fox (until 2019), and the now-defunct News of the World</em>.</p>
<p>In July 2011, Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the News of the World, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty, and public citizens. Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. </p>
<p> Many of Murdoch’s papers and television channels have been accused of biased and misleading coverage to support his business interests.</p>
<p>The sun has a long history of printing fake news, some of which has been so damaging and offensive it will never be forgotten, such as the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The sun ran a front page headline and blamed the fans for the Hillsborough tragedy, stupefying journalistic failure, it has become the public symbol of the lies at the heart of the cover-up. The editor still claims today that he was ""duped"" by corruption involving the sun, and a cover up to ""smear fans and protect the police"". </p>
<p>It wasn't that long ago that The Sun ran a story about how kind hearted Johnny Depp is as he visits children's hospitals regularly dressed as Captain Jack sparrow. It is clear and obvious, that they would do anything to sell a story, true or false as they would suddenly make these allegations against Johnny. </p>
<p>So with such a corrupt, evil and disgrace of a tabloid and news empire, and with the evidence so high against them, how did Johnny lose? Well now the connections between the judge, his son, ex wife and Rupert Murdoch are beginning to come to light. Collision? The judges son working for Rupert Murdoch? This entire case has seemingly been the biggest scandel of our recent years. </p>
<p>How is Rupert Murdoch not in prison? How is the judge not being investigated? So many questions. Only time will tell. </p>
<p>For major companies such as Disney and Warner Bros to fall behind this lies and corruption one can only guess as to why ��� </p>
<p>Let's show them that we know the truth. We stand by Johnny. Please help to share this petition and sign others that you can find to support him.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>","{'id': '224842628', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/0/bb/qq/yYBBQqGXXcIFqeD-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605024720', 'processing': False}}",,

StarterPetitionUpdate,28020906,2020-11-06T16:55:10.000Z,,Johnny Depp has been removed from Fantastic Beats!,"<p>Latest News just out, Johnny Depp has been asked to resign from his role in Fantastic Beasts. This is yet again a Major blow for him and all other victims of demestic violence, and those who have read the cases and simply cannot understand this decision. </p>
<p>So far, despite his losing of the UK trial against NGN newsgroup, all that has been stated in short is that the judge believes both Johnny and Amber but went in favour of NGN newsgroup. </p>
<p>Johnny Depp has been through hell because of her. Is this the message we should send to victims of domestic violence? That staying silent is less harmful than standing up for yourself? No. We can help Johnny, and all others, male or female whom may be going through DV, by showing our support. The public opinion is more powerful in many ways.</p>
<p>We will not stay silent. We will get justice for Johnny.</p>
<p>Remember to share the petition. Do not be afraid to stand up for what you believe in. The truth will come out. THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT.</p>

<p>Thank you so much and keep your chin up. Nothing worth doing or proving is ever easy. Positive change is never easy. But good will always beat evil, it is only a matter of time and our support will help speed it up as we apply more pressure. </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,28014300,2020-11-05T16:22:45.000Z,,"Johnny lost the battle, but not the war","<p>As you should now be well aware, Depp lost his case against NGN newsgroup. This has been yet another major blow, but all is not lost.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the court documents, evidence and the verdict I can say that I do not feel this verdict was decided upon appropriately, and was quite frankly unfair. </p>
<p>The abundance of evidence that Depp presented was not taken into account, and in short the Judge said he agreed that Depp was assaulted by heard however he believes heard and therefore ruled in her favour despite her having no tangible evidence at all. In fact, all of her steaments and aqusations were contradicted by witnesses, even by heards own friends. </p>
<p>Further to this, there has been some information regarding the judges possible personal connections to Heard which has only made this case more strange.</p>
<p>Depp will hopefully appeal this decision, but in the meantime we must also fight for justice in the ways we can. Let's show our support and share this petition. Disney appear to be under the impression that they made Depp famous, when in fact he made pirates of the carribbean famous.</p>
