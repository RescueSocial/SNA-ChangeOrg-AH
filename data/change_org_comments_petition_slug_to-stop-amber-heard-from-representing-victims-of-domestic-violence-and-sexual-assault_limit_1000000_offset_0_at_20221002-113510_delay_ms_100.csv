834977832,"I donât know they both made claims that they abused one another in their situation (each providing evidence through text or showing photos) I donât know if either party was lying about the situation or not. From the sound of it when it concerns their situation, they were both abusive towards each other. If either party was lying about anything I canât tell which in their case. Im pretty sure Johnny had to get separate rooms whst I donât know is if he provoked her in major ways that drew negative responses from and that was responsible for some of her behavior or if she acted/acts aggressive most of the time on her own, independent of anything he did or didnât do. Again, I donât know if there was any lying or not and if so from which party.

What I do know is in my own case Iâve personally experienced hostility from my mom, and fight picking from my dad before in the past, so in that respect I can understand Amber. Concerning relationships what I also feel like Iâve personally dealt with is mental and emotional abuse and repetitive cheating from my ex spouse (2013-2018) that and financial abuse, and probably some form of narcissistic abuse (he would also often try to manipulate me and the situation to try to prevent me from leaving even though he has zero intention of changing) while married when I was younger. Back then I had less support to confide in and since I did it was a lot harder to get away from him, even though I needed to (thankfully I did, although regrettably much later than I would have liked and that would have been best for me- thereâs some mental and emotional scars there because of that) Iâve been through that, and stalking and harassing from my college ex (never wanted him to bother me) and also probably bitter emotions, and maybe some things not totally in my best interest from other potential love interests (probably not entirely to my own awareness) from afar. I know I can say that much for myself in my own case, but I dont know all of the details about their relationship.",0,0,Event,33540238,0,comment,2022-08-08T01:06:41Z,,1258820557,1258820557,Kathryn,Rabalais,Kathryn,Kathryn Rabalais,Dickinson,TX,US,,en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],33540238,33540238,To Stop Amber Heard from Representing Victims of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault,2022-06-03T08:32:10Z,,2022-06-03T08:32:10Z,,en-US,['en'],To Stop Amber Heard from Representing Victims of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault,"<p>As a survivor of sexual assault and friend to many who are also survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, I do not want Amber Heard to continue to say she represents those of us true survivors.<br>I, as many others did, watched the trial in its entirety from opening statements to the verdict.

I endured 20 years with him and the last 5 years were a living hell and when he got diagnosed with a mental health title, he became even more violent including forcing himself on me and would use his diagnosis as an excuse for his actions. Watching Amber Heard on stand was like watching my husband twist and turn everything around but he got sloppy in the end and his actions and lies were all coming to the surface. Sadly, all the anger he had towards himself when he was caught in a web of lies, he'd take it out on me. He was so good at fooling everyone in the beginning, I had no choice but to start collecting proof and pictures. When he'd physically harm me he'd enter himself into a psych ward to keep from going to jail. After he choked me half to death, he went to live with family and 10 months later took his life in a blaze of drugs. As much as I despise Amber Heard I do worry about her mental health and if not already, she should be on suicide watch.  She does not represent victims like me but she should represent those with mental health issues like her that need help. Johnny Depp was a victim and he will always be my idol, he stood up and not only did he fight for his life back but he fought for victims like myself as well.

833475953,"Ms. Heard (and Heard legal team),
Please stop the gaslighting of me & others by repeating that you feel as if you failed all women by losing this case. It's quite the opposite actually. The truth spoke for itself when you acted out a script of lies. Just take accountability for once & try to start over new. Don't repeat the cycle of abuse & manipulation. Be honest with yourself. If you cant then just stop your constant attacks. I pray you just move forward, learn from this & stop the dramatics once & for all.

You're still attempting to defame Johnny & digging the knife into victims of abuse everywhere. Especially when you acted on emotion/anger by having Elaine go through with that interview this morning. Your online statement was more than enough.

Most of the time & I absolutely believe this true with you, people are the company they keep. This is absolutely obvious after watching Elaine's interview. I wanted to believe she had some wits to her. However, she is a narcissist who loves to gaslight people, just like you Amber.

833433794,"I agree with all Tammy D said in the petition. I watched the entire trial, though I'll admit, watching AMBER HEARD PERFORM got more & more difficult, her acting worse & worse. And NOW...watching ELAINE BREDEHOFT perpetuate Amber's lies, particularly after how not only badly they lost but how badly Amber Heard treated her legal team, threatened to fire them, but yet, they continued to LIE ON THE STAND as Officers of the Court!!! but that is FAR from the worst of it now. That ELAINE BREDEHOFT can go on this press tour, look people in the eyes, reminds me of Amber's ability to lie like a rug. Does Elaine believe her own lies now, too? And Amber's? Or is she trying to save face? She got her bum kicked and NOTHING she can do now will help! Yes, it was a setback! It was a setback for REAL survivors of domestic violence who can't & won't get on a stand and lie. Amber's freedom of speech was allowed FAR TOO LONG! Freedom of Speech does NOT cover falsities and lies! It does NOT protect defamation! Apparently, someone needs to tell them this but they, also apparently, DON'T GET IT! What her legal team SHOULD be doing is NOTHING AT ALL! They should take their loss & fade away so everyone, & especially Johnny Depp, can begin to heal from this s#*! show. Amber can't even afford to pay Johnny, her legal team and now wants to preach about APPEALING???She can't! Unless she can produce some kind of amazing surety bond or has really terrific liability insurance, NOTHING she does can erect even a reason for an appeal. There was not ONE mistake in that trial (other than having to listen to AH!!). She SURE does NOT deserve another trial...another platform! PLEASE don't give it to her! Help STOP them!! And don't listen to or play the ""jurors"" TikTok vids, Youtube vids, posts from ANY social media platform because it is widely believed ELAINE BREDEHOFT is actually perpetuating a fake disinformation campaign using people who are willing to pose as jurors to try to get an appeal on juror misconduct! Please! Jurors names' are protected for a year BUT they can speak out but PLEASE, REAL JURORS wait the requisite 21 days before doing so! I think it is what...June 22? Check & be sure but then, GO FOR IT! Be ready to committing to proving who you re as you will be vetted to be believed (thanks to the current campaign potentially bred by Amber's legal team) but we would LOVE to hear from you! After there is NO THREAT of an appeal on juror misconduct. PLEASE!! And thank you, Tammy D, for preparing this petition! We WILL get MANY more signatures!

833421530,"I grew up in an abusive and violent household.  Itâs a struggle to talk about it 25-30 years later without real emotion.  I donât believe Amber Heard suffered in any way at the hands of Johnny Depp.  I believe she is insulted that he doesnât want her any more, scared to death at the thoughts of not having his money and benefits any longer, and jumped on the first thing she thought of. 

She accused him of vile things with no proof. No pictures. Nothing. She has pictures of him sleeping, of beds, of staged tables, but not ONE real picture of her bruises, her physical assaults, her blood, etc.  Any woman who has been abused ALWAYS has pictures of their abuse. Even back when Polaroids existed. Itâs literally your first line of defense in proving abuse. 

She is an absolute shame to women who have really suffered,  Women who were scared for their own life but also their kids, women who had to escape and start over again.

833400959,"I am a survivor of domestic abuse, and Amber Heard is a domestic abuser. She doesn't represent me. True survivors recognize the gaslighting, twisting words, and attempts to manipulate others that we saw in our abusers. She got caught in lie after lie on the stand. She presented her stories in ways that myself and other true survivors of domestic abuse do not find consistant with our shared experiences.  I believe the me too movement has been set back by this trial, but not because of Johnny Depp; Now when a true survivor speaks up, she may not be believed because of Amber's lies. The best thing she can do for victims of domestic violence is to become a private person and seperate herself from the issue entirely. Domestic abuse survivors used to have a leg to stand on when we said women should be believed because (for nearly all of us) there is nothing to gain from lying. Amber heard has taken the credibility of survivors away from us.

My ex put me through 5 years of hell and left me with anxiety, depression, lack of confidence, and many other issues but I gained my three beautiful daughters from the pathetic excuse for marriage. For those three I will always fight and do better to show them we are strong and our experiences donât define our futures. I managed to escape with my girls and start over. Put myself through nursing school and make a beautiful life for us. Met the man of my dreams, who we share a house with, who is the best daddy to my girls and we never have to worry ever again. I can tell you 100% if I were in a court room with my ex, I couldnât look at him without a panic attack, let alone sit there and pretend to cry and make stuff up.

833396213,"I survived DV and Mental Abuse. 
My ex hit me when we were dating. Told me that same story everyone hears ""oh I will change! I promise"" Well  he did he became mentally abusive. Never to our kids. Then he made the choice to get himself into trouble with the law. Cops bust in my house arrest him cause it turns out he's a pedophile. Talking to a girl. Well talk about blow to your self esteem. I divorced him as ge went to jail. So now i suffer from PTSD thanks to his BS. Then i met a ""guy"" that i thought would be great so sweet charming. NOPE he had a secert too. It turns out he was an alcoholic and abused prescription drugs. He used to get so messed up he would grab me by the throat while hitting me in the face. He pushed me full force into the wall, I hit my head and made a hole in the wall. When i was at work he would sit around and drink and try and burn my house down. I never left my boys here while he was here they stayed at my moms cause he was so unpredictable. 
Fast forward to 2016 I went on a blind lunch date and it was love at 1st sight for both. My husband has never raised a hand to me or my kids. He is the best father and my best friend. Im glad I was able to escape the abuse and be happy.

She ruined that man's life for 6 years by lying about abuse that wasn't happening to her. She stole other survivor's stories and tried to pass them off as her own. No actual victim would have to make things up and would NEVER use another person's trauma as their own. She is the reason women aren't believed when we do step forward.

833390254,"This right here is why I'm signing this petition. I do not for one minute believe anything happens to amber heard. 
 I started dating someone I thought I trusted who I have known for years. I met him in grade 7 and we dated then as well. I started seeing him in June. This guy was perfect. He treated me so so well. I thought I could trust him and I definitely thought it was ment to be. Fast forward to September 17th 2021. 

I had just put my son to sleep and invited the guy I was seeing over to have dinner with me and spend the weekend. This was a Friday night. He came over and brought some xannax. Me being the foll I am took two. I thought it would help with my anxiety and depression. He ended up passing out in my bed. I had laundry to do so I did my laundry, ( I did smoke a medical cannabis joint for stomach pain) and then I proceeded to lay down next to him. I put my alarm on to switch my laundry and fell asleep. 

The next thing I knew I was in the hospital. I awoke to my adoptive mother telling me I had been in a coma for 5 days. This perfect man I thought I had attacked me in my sleep. He took a curtain rod to the back and front of my head while I was asleep. He then undressed me and dragged my body to the other side of the room. He put ciggerets out all over my body including my knuckles and toes. He then left my lifeless body on the floor. After he was done with me he destroyed my house. Stole valuable belongings. Then peed on EVERYTHING. 

My poor son who was 6 at the time hid in his stuffed animals for 2 days while this was going on. After my attacker had left my son ran down to the basement tenants and they called 911. I'm so so lucky to have my son. He litterally saved my life. I'm a type 1 dibetic as well so being with out insulin killed my kidneys. 

I had to do two rounds.of dialisis, they were expecting me to be on it for life but I beat those odds! I have server damage to my skull. Server nerve damage, a c spine injury and loss of feeling in random places of my body. I can't feel or move my right foot ether. I lost all of my belongings and my son's. And I lost my house. I was in the hospital for 3 months and a woman's shelter for 4. I'm finally settled in at a little basement apartment thanks to the yellow brick house.

I am so so lucky to be alive and to be able to some what walk. ( I still feel like a pirate with a peg leg but I'm ALIVE) 

I do want to warn you all. I have recently found out that xannax is only made and sold in the states. In any other country it's not legal. The xannax I took was fake xannax. It was a date rape drug. Please please please be careful out there. I wish I knew this information before that. I lost almost everything because.of that poor choice I made.

What Amber Heard does not seem to understand is, that it was not the evidence or lack thereof that had millions of domestic violence or sexual assault survivors not believe her, it was her own testimony.Â <br>Survivors and empathetic people recognize and respond to other survivors or someone in true pain from trauma.Â <br>I myself cry easily at hearing traumatic events described by someone else including real people, or characters in movies, TV shows, or other media. I didn't connect at all and did not shed one tear (nor did she) throughout her entire testimony. Now she has not only made a shocking statement after the verdict that continues the lies but she plans to appeal and sent her lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft on a disgusting morning show press tour saying she didn't get a fair trial.Â <br>AMBER HEARD and ELAINE BREDEHOFT, we, the survivors of real domestic violence and sexual assault are asking you to please stop!
