I am currently dealing with a situation in which my ex-boyfriend, a “Johnny” -not Depp but rather dubbed Melendrez-Avila has falsely accused me of DV. A little backstory to shed some light into how very messed up people with no emotional control can wreak havoc into an innocent persons life… this Johnny and I had been in an on and off relationship for approximately 3 years. This last time on our relationship which terminated August 2021 (realistically I had checked out of that relationship months prior) he became upset because I did not want to continue to see him and because I set drift elsewhere with someone else and thus he decided he would accuse me of domestic violence as retaliation for “breaking his heart”. A few weeks prior while he was on an alcoholic binge which is not unusual for this individual, he became aggressive while we were out that day at a bar, he slapped my hand in his vehicle and had his neighbor in the backseat who witnessed it all, we proceeded the night out which resulted in altercations between Johnny and I, upon arrival to his apartment he violently wanted me out of his apartment. As I gathered my things he began calling police to state that I was refusing to leave his apartment, at that point while I was sitting on the living room sofa he began pushing me off by moving and lifting the sofa to get me out by force, at that point I called police because I feared my safety given that he has a history of domestic violence. At that point after begging while I was on the phone with authorities he ran outside to the next building over to get his neighbor, meanwhile I began to take my things down to my vehicle to wait for police.  Upon arrival he created a false story that I had slapped him and he has his neighbor as an alleged witness. The neighbor gave the false story that never happened and police then decided to arrest me and take me in regardless of the fact that there was no evidence of abuse towards Johnny “Juan” Avila. I was arrested and I was and remain innocent that I never did anything to Mr Avila. Next day, he bailed me out … why? If I was such a violent abusive person why would you bail me? Because he was lying! He felt guilty… the recordings on the phone calls from the jail to him he is drunk slurry and saying he will take care of everything soon, he proceeded to go out about his night and continue binge drinking. After the matter Juan wanted to make the relationship work, he wanted to go to therapy, he kept telling me, “don’t worry baby I’m going to take care of it all let me handle it” detectives called me and him and the alleged witness.. Juan even got worried when detectives asked if I wanted to press charges on him, the detective knew! I told him the same story I am saying now there has not been any discrepancies, however Juan’s story and the alleged witness story have never matched from the date of police arrival to the detective interview. YET injustice is committed because when Juan found out I wasn’t going to be with him anymore he took it upon himself to call detectives and lie that he wanted to proceed with charges and he clearly told me over the phone that whatever happened to me was my own doing, simply because I didn’t want to be with him!… the emotional immaturity, outbursts and fragile ego of this individual has cost me ALOT! It is not okay to accuse someone false of acts that jeopardize one’s livelihood, career and life! I am continuing to fight this case because I am innocent and the court doesn’t care about the truth! The court only cares about making a charge collecting fines, money spent on “rehabilitation” and nothing else! There’s no further investigation into the abuse I endured  with Juan, and the minute I finally had the courage to leave and move forward he decided to attempt to ruin my life with a false accusation simply as emotional retaliation! This petition is to make things right, just and to expose the truth! These accusations are detrimental to innocent people and I am sure I’m not the only woman battling a similar case because of a narcissist with manipulative psychopathic tendencies!
