We're doing good and I know there's not a lot of time left in the trial but that's okay. We're doing what we can. </p>,,,

StarterPetitionUpdate,30584065,2022-05-23T23:20:08.000Z,,150 supporters!!,"<p>This is getting so much more attention than I originally thought it would. I'm so happy for Amber. </p>
<p>We're making a change for all abuse victims everywhere. We won't fail women. Johnny hasn't won us over, and he won't. I know many of us probably did but now we're doing so much better. </p>",,,
StarterPetitionUpdate,30571329,2022-05-19T22:34:10.000Z,,Over 110!!,"<p>We reached 100! Over 100 in fact, we're doing so well. Keeping up with the trial really sucks the life out of your day, I can hardly stand looking at Johnny. She laughs a few times on stand or in court and she 'broke character' and is guilty. Johnny does the same thing and he's innocent and everyone loves him. It's so heartbreaking and confusing. All my love to Amber. </p>",,,

StarterPetitionUpdate,30565860,2022-05-18T17:32:11.000Z,,Almost to 100!!,"<p>We're more than halfway there, we're doing so good for not just Amber but women everywhere who weren't believed. Men everywhere are going to do the same thing Johnny did just because they know they can get away with it now. We're not going to let that happen. </p>
<p>Thank you for signing and showing your support. The media has entirely demonized her and in turn demonized all lgbt, unsubmissive, women who fight back again abuse. </p>",,,

StarterPetitionUpdate,30561530,2022-05-17T17:19:22.000Z,,Please share more!,"<p>13 signatures in the past 12 hours is so cool but, amber deserves better. I can only share so much and keep myself safe from the unending ridicule and threats from supporting her. Please help me, and help Amber, by sharing as much as possible. </p>
<p>Yesterday started the cross examination and so far it is a dumpster fire!! The questions are wrong to be asking, and obviously are confusing her when she's already shaken up from being in court and having to be around her abuser. </p>","{'id': '226624702', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/6/zi/wu/AGziWusLjDHQIrO-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652807964', 'processing': False}}",,
