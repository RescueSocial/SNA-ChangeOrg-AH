StarterPetitionUpdate,30617303,2022-06-02T05:27:08.000Z,,Good news and some bad news,"<p>Good News, Disney stood up for vulnerable minorities and both Toby Emmerich and Walter Hamada are leaving Warner Bros.</p>
<p>Bad News, Director James Wan had a lot of his movie; Aquaman the Lost Kingdom's action scenes removed by sexist Toby Emmerich as one of Emmerich's last actions at Warner Bros. I'll keep this Petition open until Aquaman 2 scripts action scenes are put back in.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who show public support for Disney to do better and for Warner Bros to get rid of their bad actors (President Toby Emmerich and Executive Walter Hamada). We got Pixar's Lightyear and Strange World coming out to theaters in 3D and with any luck Ray Fischer should be back in the solo Cyborg movie we were promised a long time ago.</p>",,,
