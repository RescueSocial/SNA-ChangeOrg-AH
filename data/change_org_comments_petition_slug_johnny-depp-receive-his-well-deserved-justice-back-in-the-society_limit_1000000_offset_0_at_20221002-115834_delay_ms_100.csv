833414624,"Many call themselves feminists – and then leave it at the staged self-image and, when it really matters, cowardly sneak away and leave their sisters alone in need. The term feminist becomes a proudly worn label. We like to move with the times, but less like to take to the streets as demonstrators, and we even less like to stand up for female victims of male violence.
Every year again... we celebrate Feminist Struggle Day! If you still want to buy cleaning supplies, cosmetics, chocolates or diapers, this is the day for them. Because only on March 8th are all these and other products reduced. Although in principle there is nothing wrong with colorful nail polish or delicious chocolates, this commercialization mistakenly turns the feminist struggle day into something “apolitical”. It thus robs it of its meaning and reinforces all the gender stereotypes that need to be fought anyway.
Many feminist demands are decades, sometimes even centuries old, and some of them are no less relevant today than they were then. But it takes courage to address gender discrimination, global hate crimes against women, and the social injustice that goes with it. Because after that it is no longer possible to see the world with the same eyes.
Because regardless of whether we describe ourselves as political or apolitical: abstention is also a political decision.
We don't need ""girl power"", we need real solidarity among each other. A feminist association that demands its rights shoulder to shoulder and translates these demands and wishes into its own life. An association that stands by and supports each other in solidarity.
We live in times of war unilaterally declared by men against us, sisters.
They humiliate us, they abuse us, they kill us, they rape us, they enslave us, they force us to give birth, they force us to marry them, they sentence us to death, they lynch us for disobeying. They want us weak, defenseless, dependent on them, hungry, they want us anxious, sad, tired, docile, without the right to a life of our own, equal education, equal pay, equal civil and human rights, without the right to our own sexuality, without rights to one's own body. They don't want to accept us as human beings, they don't want to grant us equal rights, no real freedom, no self-determined and non-violent life. Open your eyes sisters and don't be silent any longer, for together we are strong.
-Anita Kanitz trade unionist

""So that we can finally say goodbye to the credibility that many of us still attribute to the institutions and apparatuses of representative democracy, because they are institutions and apparatuses that were‘ written only for men ’. We have to find a way to combine 'democracy' with 'female authority'; therein lies the spirit and foundation of the second women's revolution. (…) We can become sovereigns today because the times are good for them, and not because it is our right. In fact, female sovereignty, if exercised, is in and of itself independence from the unreality that lies in agony Have created institutions. It ensures a return to reality and the ability to tell the truth. ""
Annarosa Buttarelli

The internet and the media are opening our eyes to what the world is really like, sisters. As we are really seen by men worldwide, there is not a trace of equality and female freedom, sexually motivated contemptive male hatred strikes us all, in all countries, networks, in all religions and without exception it affects all age groups and social classes. We are hated and persecuted for one reason only, because we are female.
Digital violence can affect everyone, regardless of gender, age, origin or religion. Sexist digital violence, however, is primarily directed against women and girls.
This affects all female beings, including myself, who use the Internet and whom I know worldwide. Sexual witch hunts with threats of murder and rape are very common, not to mention the sexual deepfakes that have already wiped out many existences.
The Duden defines sexism as the ""idea that one gender is inherently superior to the other, and the discrimination, oppression, neglect and disadvantage of people, especially women, because of their gender, which is considered justified.""
Sexist violence is therefore the form of violence that is based on the assumption that men are naturally superior to women. This form of violence against women based on their gender can be found both in analogue and digital form.
Degradation, threats, sexual harassment, and misogynistic comments are just a few examples of forms of sexist digital violence. There is also image-based sexual abuse, in which nude photos of (in most cases, but not exclusively) women and girls are created or stolen and uploaded to porn sites without their consent. The threat of sexual offenses is also a widespread form of sexist digital violence.
Intimidation and silencing are not unique features of sexist digital violence. Men and non-binary people are also actively pushed out of the discourse in certain debates. What is striking, however, is how strategically women are to be silenced - especially when they want to draw attention to social or political injustices. Women in public life are particularly often the target of organized hate campaigns. Hate comments are directed against their appearance (“You are ugly”), their sexuality (“Nobody wants you, that's why you're single”) or their emotionality (“You are hysterical”). They are also threatened with gender-based violence (“you should be raped”) or “given their places” (“go back to the kitchen where you belong”). All of these examples are gender specific and have nothing to do with the actual discourse.
Little is said about the digital side of violence - harassment and harassment are increasingly shifting to the internet. However, the Internet also offers ways to defend yourself.
Many offenses in the area of ​​digital violence are not reported - for various reasons. In the case of sexual harassment, for example, the number of unreported cases is generally high - online and offline.
Women and girls who have become the target of a shit storm should defend themselves in any case!
Hate comments must be reported. Those affected by hate speech should not 'comb through' the Shitstorm themselves for criminal content, but hand it over to confidants, as the psychological burden is simply too great
The public can help in dealing with a shit storm, on the one hand, because solidarity can be aroused within the network community and counter-speech can be activated. On the other hand, because the public increases awareness of the subject of hate speech. But it can also do the opposite, unfortunately ...
The situation is even more difficult when those affected have to defend themselves against perpetrators, as is often the case with stalking.
The first step is to admit that you have become a victim of stalking and that you don't need to be ashamed of it!
You have a right to say no and you have to tell the perpetrators that you don't want to.
The public could deter offenders - because although stalkers incessantly harass their victim and repeatedly draw attention to themselves, this often happens in such a way that others do not notice.
Even if those affected often have the impulse to delete the incriminating attacks, the digital evidence should be saved, screenshots and messages should be saved and a diary should be kept of the attacks.
Above all, those affected should not sit at home alone with their problem, but rather talk to someone!
Showing moral courage on the internet means, for example, to write a counter speech against hatred on the internet and also not to accept other violations of persons or of legal norms, but to act consciously and courageously against it!
Civil courage is required not only in the analog world, but also in the digital parallel world of the Internet. This is often experienced as an unlawful area: Potential perpetrators feel unobserved and free from the constraints of the legal order and social control. For those affected by ""hate speech"" or other forms of violence online, this often leads to limitless feelings of powerlessness. It is estimated that one in three women experienced “online violence” in one form or another in the past year. Those affected not only need the certainty that instruments of the rule of law also work online, they also need the solidarity of other users.
Adult men take advantage of the naivety and inexperience of young girls online to initiate sexual contacts or abuse or rape up to group rape.
Digital violence is often more difficult to punish than analogue violence. The Internet offers the perpetrators anonymity and reach, which makes it difficult to prosecute quickly. In addition, targeted sexist attacks have not yet been reflected in existing laws. If they decide to file criminal charges against sexist digital violence attacks, women are often not taken seriously. So far there is a lack of structures to adequately track and punish sexist digital violence.
Violence against women is increasing. At least that is the impression of many women who are in public. Insults, discrimination and threats are becoming more and more radical, especially on the Internet. In the crime statistics, misogynist violence is usually only listed generally as ""online hate"", ""violence in a partner"" or ""stalking"".
Imagine your rape is a click hit online and those who are supposed to protect you don't believe you! This is everyday life for women, girls and female children all over the world.
As women, we are the same at this point, because sexual violence involuntarily welds us together as women, beyond all the things that separate us and make our worlds so different at other times. If violence happens to us, we are the same!
Imagine being violated and your trauma is documented with a camera and posted online for everyone to see. Anyone who wants to can see how you are humiliated and two men consciously disregard your will. Imagine your rape is now a click-hit online and those who are supposed to protect you don't believe you. They believe the men who treat you as an object in the recording of their deed and cheer themselves on as if you weren't there, the gain in pleasure in their actions arises between them - with the help of your body, which looks as if you have been numbed so that you can yourself can not fight back.
You kept saying “stop”, but it's not enough for them to stop, according to German law that's not enough to say that it wasn't right. Everyone can see it, but that's not enough.
The men can do whatever they want with the women, and then they are the cool ones, the heroes.
I've had enough. It is enough for me that, despite arguments and protests, we have had a law and a legal system for decades that cannot protect the weaker from violence and that does not punish those who abuse their power. We also want something completely different from being protected; we want this society to guarantee us freedom. For decades, the relationship between charges and convictions, as well as the acts that have never been reported, have shown that what was thought up to prevent and punish violence does not even begin to work. Every third woman in Germany experiences sexual or physical violence at least once in her life.
Women who have experienced exactly that are part of your family, they are your colleagues in the office, you pay them at the cash register, they treat you as a doctor and teach your children, they host a TV show with a smile, they vote on laws in the Bundestag and work in ministries, you are perhaps one of those far too many women who has experienced violence or who it happens tomorrow.
And vice versa: There are men in your family who do not respect women, they are your colleagues or friends, you pay for your coffee-to-go with them, they advise you on taxes, they vote on laws in the Bundestag, they work in ministries and moderate the news.
I don't like looking to the USA because it is so worn out and helpless and the society there is also miles away from protecting women and LGBTTIQ from violence. Nevertheless, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, said really remarkable things several times and compared to other politicians, such as this quote:
""I want every young man in America to know that real men don’t hurt women. And those of us who are fathers have a special obligation to make sure every young man out there understands that being a man means recognizing sexual violence and being outraged by it, and doing their part to stop it. ""
Such a sentence from our government or judiciary, unthinkable ?!
No. Because they do not have the courage to use similar words to name this one decisive gender difference: who experiences the majority of violence from whom and who abuses physical and social power over whom.
No, it is of no use to women and LGBTTIQ that everything is negotiated harshly in the media in law or coalition negotiations or in editorials if at this crucial point it is not said what is.
Anyone who wants real equality and an end to violence, the utopia that is simply called women's freedom, can forget the rule of law. Even with more progressive parties in government, we will not experience a truly free life on this path, not even as a 110-year-old old woman. No, we have to, we must no longer be patient. It is enough.
I think it's time to tell this truth again. Laws will not free us from sexual violence and other injustices.
So there are enough other people to ally with to get the freedom we need. Participate. We need each other.
Civil courage is required not only in the analog world, but also in the digital parallel world of the Internet. This is often experienced as an unlawful area: Potential perpetrators feel unobserved and free from the constraints of the legal order and social control. For those affected by ""hate speech"" or other forms of violence online, this often leads to limitless feelings of powerlessness. It is estimated that one in three women experienced “online violence” in one form or another in the past year. Those affected not only need the certainty that instruments of the rule of law also work online, they also need the solidarity of other users.
For our entire democratic society, however, it is essential that sexist digital violence does not go unpunished. Intimidation and silencing of women make pluralistic digital discourse impossible. Girls and women, like everyone else, must be able to feel safe online!
We have been sold to the powerful lie that we women have won the battle against misogyny and inequality. We should get rid of this manipulative insidious lie.
Digital and all forms of violence against women and girls concern us all.
Online Defamation of women, deadly misogyny, sexual hate crimes, femicides are the biggest pandemics of this century.
Men are one of the leading causes of premature death in women worldwide. However, societies and governments and the judiciary worldwide still refuse to recognize this fact.
64 percent of women were killed by their current or former partner; the remaining majority by a father, brother, son, colleague, employee, customer or friend. Only a fraction of the murders (less than 10 percent) were committed by an outside perpetrator.
It's shocking, but it seems like women who raise women's rights issues are only more exposed to sexism and misogyny. The way people think doesn't seem to change much.
At least once in her life, one in three women worldwide will experience verbal and physical attacks that belittle, threaten or hurt her as a woman.
In principle, it begins with everyday sexism and ends with femicide. Because they all have one thing in common: the perpetrators are men who claim power over women and want to enforce it.
In the future like in the past, women who have experienced domestic assault, violence or sexual abuse will still think carefully about whether they want to talk about what they have experienced - and expose themselves to public scrutiny about their experiences, even to the point of social annihilation. And the perpetrators have tools old and new: the libel suit, the victim accusation, the male witch hunt subjecting their victims to a devastating public tribunal that many female victims have experienced and endured throughout living memory.
This hate crime continues unabated and unpunished worldwide. If women want equality, they must not be silenced, because men cannot kill us all. Even they aren't so stupid, because that would mean the annihilation of humanity, including males.
There are many crimes against women, girls and female childs: Domestic and sexual violence, street harassment, workplace harassment, catcalling, Eve teasing, taharrush gamea, rape culture, mass and gang rapes, war rapes, child rapes, marital rapes, dowry murder, forced and child marriages, FGM, sex slavery, women, girls and child trafficking, forced prostitution, rape pornography, online harassment, sadistic stalking, domestic and sexual murder, acid attacks, femicide, female infanticide, daily hate speech and sexism, sadistic and forced sexual practices, lack of freedom, education and human rights, forced dress codes like chador and burqa, victim blaming of assault, stalking, bullying and rape victims,witch hunts, widow murders, executions like stoning for rape and assault victims, imprisonment and punishment of female victims..
Violence against women, girls and female childs - particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence - are major public health problems and violations of women's human rights and childrens rights..
Recent global prevalence figures indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.
Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (30%) of women who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.
Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.
Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health, and may increase vulnerability to HIV.
Factors associated with increased risk of perpetration of violence include low education, child maltreatment or exposure to violence in the family, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality.
Factors associated with increased risk of experiencing intimate partner and sexual violence include low education, exposure to violence between parents, abuse during childhood, attitudes accepting violence and gender inequality.
There is evidence from high-income settings that school-based programmes may be effective in preventing relationship violence (or dating violence) among young people.
In low-income settings, primary prevention strategies, such as microfinance combined with gender equality training and community-based initiatives that address gender inequality and relationship skills, hold promise.
Situations of conflict, post conflict and displacement may exacerbate existing violence, such as by intimate partners, and present additional forms of violence against women.
Global violence uniquely affects the girl child. Although international legal instruments have been in place for decades to protect the girl child, thousands of brutal acts of violence and neglect specifically targeting the girl child can be observed around the world on a daily basis. For centuries, girls who have barely attained adolescence have been forced into marriage, often with men many years their senior. As a minor, a girl child cannot legally give her consent to enter into such a partnership. They have suffered in female genital mutilation rituals. They are traded, bought, and sold across national borders as commodities to be put to use as prostitutes or slaves, or merely to be sold again at a profit. Many girls are even victimized before birth, as technology and greater access to medicine have given rise to prenatal sex selection and selection abortion based on sex. Girls continue to face the threat of sexual harassment and abuse in workplaces and schools. Their lives may be taken for the “honor” of their families for speaking to strangers or committing other minor transgressions. Violence against the girl child has become a powerful and all-too-common tactic in times of war and humanitarian disaster.
 That is the reason why I am fighting my whole life for human rights, women and girls rights and children's rights. But it is not enough, day by day the world is getting a more dangerous and barbaric place for childs, girls and women! And the greatest danger on earth for all of us are the male humans, what a shame for humankind!
Femicide, misogyny, stalking, sexual violence, rape culture, hate speech is everywhere!
We don't want to use the term ‘harassment.’ What is happening today is sexual terrorism.
A strong woman stands up for herself. A stronger woman stands up for everyone else.
Anita Kanitz, German trade unionist

A very sad case of modern witch hunt and evil misogyny, in the society, online and worldwide:
""I am harassed, humiliated and threatened every single day just by walking into this courtroom.I get hundreds of death threats on a regular basis, almost every day. Thousands since this process began. People make fun of my statements that I was abused.""
""The disappointment I feel today is beyond words. I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband.""
""I’m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women.
""It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously.""
“I’m sad I lost this case.But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American — to speak freely and openly.”
Amber Heard, actress and victim of sexual, domestic and narcissistic violence and a media witch hunt worldwide
 
The Amber Heard-Johnny Depp trial was an orgy of misogyny! In text messages to friends, Johnny Depp fantasized about murdering his then-wife, the actress Amber Heard. “I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead,” Depp wrote. In other texts, he disparaged his wife’s body in luridly misogynist terms. “Mushy pointless dangling overused floppy fish market,” he called her.The texts became public as part of Depp’s defamation suit against Heard, now at trial in a Virginia court. Ostensibly, Depp is suing over a 2018 article that Heard published in the Washington Post, titled “I spoke up against sexual violence – and faced our culture’s wrath.” In the piece, the actress writes, “Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse.” The article does not mention Depp, but his lawyers say that the piece was about him – and was defamatory. For those 11 words, Depp is seeking 15 millions. Johnny Depp was a drug addict prone to violent rages and a misogynist who assaulted his wife and used abusive language about women, a London court heard in 2020 as the actor’s libel trial against a British tabloid neared its end. By accusing Heard of physically assaulting him, Depp was seeking to reverse the roles of offender and victim.
After the couple split up, Depp set out to destroy Heard. “She’s begging for total global humiliation... She’s gonna get it,” he said in a text to a friend in 2016. “I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of emotion, or what I once thought was love, for this gold digging, low level, dime a dozen, mushy pointless dangling overused flappy fish market.”He also described in very graphic terms an act of violence he would like to commit against someone he called “Mollusk”. The Depp-Heard trial in 2022 shines light on issues of domestic abuse and feminism.
 
The courtroom drama between former spouses Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, in which he is seeking $50 million in damages for her allegations of abuse during their marriage while she is reiterating the accusations and countersuing for $100 million, has been drawing a lot of attention — and not just because it’s a sordid saga involving Hollywood celebrities.
Although it was very obvious in the process who is the perpetrator and who is the victim, Johnny Depp won the process, while Amber Heard's life and career seems destroyed. That is the unbelievable, here the worldwide misogyny showed its ugly face, as in many, many processes where child molesters, women and girls molesters, women and child bullies, women-destroying online haters go unpunished or completely unpunished. Who wants to talk about justice and equality here? To claim that would be a joke based on the shocking facts. A jury in the USA found actor Johnny Depp mostly right in the defamation trial against his ex-wife and colleague Amber Heard on 06/01/22. Heard had accused Depp of abuse and domestic violence - the seven jurors in Fairfax, Virginia found that she defamed him. She must therefore pay $ 10.35 million in damages to Depp. The sum is significantly less than the $ 50 million for which Depp had sued. At the same time, according to the verdict, Depp also has to pay two million dollars to Heard. The jury also agreed on a number of points. Heard counterclaimed Depp's lawsuit, demanding $100 million. Dressed all in black, Heard followed the verdict in court, Depp did not show up. Numerous onlookers and fans, especially Depp, had gathered in front of the court, who cheered after the verdict and shouted ""Johnny, Johnny"". This trial of Heard reminded me of the witch trials of the Middle Ages, men and women screamed burn the witch, even though all these people and witch hunt victims, women, girls, children, a few men, more than 6 million victims only in Europe, were innocent. Has humanity learned nothing? From my point of view not! The hate that Heard hits, hits all victims, above all, all female people, but that doesn't seem to be clear to many female Depp fans and Depp supporters. Out of stupidity, out of malice, hard to say! This verdict and this trial will brand all future victims as liars, lunatics, abusers, career wreckers, and it hits all victims, female, male, child, thanks to Johnny Depp. We have one narcisstic man and his crazy fan base to thank for this disaster and as always, the misogynist message doesn't just come from Islamic countries, but from the westernmost country of all, America!
 
For their part, Depp’s fans seem to not so much deny Depp’s alleged violence against Heard, but to approve of it. “He could have killed you,” says one viral Tiktok supporting Depp, the text superimposed over photos of Heard’s bruised face. “He had every right.” The post has more than 222,200 likes.The backlash to #Me Too has long been under way. Critics of the movement painted women’s efforts to end sexual violence as excessive and intemperate from the start, claiming #MeToo had “gone too far” before it really got under way at all. And yet the Heard trial does feel like a tipping point in our culture’s response to gender violence. The forces of misogynist reaction are perhaps even stronger now for having been temporarily repressed. Where once women refused, en masse, to keep men’s secrets, or to remain silent about the truth of their own lives, now, a resurgence of sexism, virulent online harassment, and the threat of lawsuits, all aim to compel women back into silence – by force. What Johnny Depp, his lawyers, lots of media and social media, his so-called friends are doing here is a misogynistic witch hunt and a global slap in the face to all victims of violence, female and male. While the victim is showered with scorn, hatred and threats, the perpetrator is frenetically celebrated as a hero and victim.
Here in Germany we also have an opinion and we see things differently than America, which is obviously incredibly misogynistic. A lot of people who see this are tired of going to America or watching any movies with misogynistic full drug and alcohol addicted narcissistic American male jerks and I mean that seriously. We in Germany are sick of Americam disgusting witch hunts and misogyny and the day of days is coming when the misdeeds will fall back on this evil people.
I don't think much of America anymore, we're not in the Middle Ages, where innocent people were tortured and burned as witches. So honestly, is it still possible?Can we now herald the end of Metoo after so many people around the world are literally spitting on a victim of violence and hounding them to death. Where is the women's movement in America, where are the human rights of women in America? Likely disappeared in the new witch trial of a woman in America, instigated by a psychopathic narcissist and believe it or not, by millions of female and male supporters, including courts and attorneys. And in the 21st century, to say most normal people are pissed off here is an understatement.
It's a lesson in misogyny: the hate campaign against Amber Heard. There are a lot of things happening in the world right now that demand our attention and outrage. A multi-billionaire who presents himself as an icon of ""free speech"" wants to silence a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment. Global warming has reached a point of no return, but serious environmental protection is just a little too uncomfortable for the super-rich and industrialized nations. In the United States, killing sprees and terrorist attacks are now happening every week. And then there is the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, which has meanwhile joined the misery that we have learned to accept with a shrug of the shoulders.
However, when it comes to Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, all of this news seems secondary. The eye of the online public is on the court case between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, which is currently taking place in Fairfax, Virginia. The background can actually be told quickly: Amber Heard published a feminist article in the Washington Post in December 2018, in which she wrote, among other things: “Two years ago I became a public figure representing domestic violence; and I felt the full brunt of our culture's hatred of women speaking out publicly.” Heard had split from her husband Johnny Depp at the time; the split came with a domestic violence restraining order and she was photographed with bruises on her face.
The British tabloid ""Sun"" described Johnny Depp as a ""wife beater"". The Hollywood star went to court in 2020 - and has now suffered a deserved defeat there. The judge in charge ruled that the information in the text of the Sun was ""essentially true"". That's why Depp's lawsuit was dismissed.
Do you think this man would finally have calmed down? If all violent, controlling and raping men are now allowed to sue their victims, where are we going? Nobody thought of that among the women who support Depp because of his supposed good looks and his charm, and also like his ex-wives out of cowardice. Powerful men and men in general are always right, who is going to report a perpetrator anymore? In this way, female, male and child victims are silenced by perpetrators. Female betrayal is evident in two of Johnny Depp's ex-girlfriends who also broke up with him, have been called cunts by him and now claim he was a wonderful man. Honestly, I would like to see into the brains of the ladies, did they get so much money from him that they say something like this, even though they know full well that the trial is against all victims, not just against Amber Heard. If Heard loses, we all lose and Metoo is a thing of the past!
I can't hear these constant victim accusations and non-stop abuser apologies anymore. If you think only men blame female victims, think again. Often the women with accusations are even more extreme and insulting. Who hasn't had that happen to you, you become a victim of catcalling on the street, other women say, my God you're sensitive, you just don't listen. Or your classmate, colleague, boss sexually harassed you, many women scream right away, honestly, you didn't provoke them, men don't do it for no reason. A female relative is beaten up badly by her husband, often with children, most women scream right away, yes, this woman deserves it, she and her children must be cheeky. A female friend is gang raped, female sympathy, non-existent, they say, honestly, doesn't she look like a slut and doesn't she deserve it? A woman is being stalked, women are immediately screaming in chorus, yes, you must have had an affair with the guy, it's your own fault, otherwise he wouldn't be so fixated on you... And so on and so on...
Together women are strong. Together we make a change. Together we triumph!
If you are a survivor of sexual and domestic violence, rape and abuse, psychic terror and sadistic stalking, be proud of yourself. Because you have survived, in spite of everything, with all your courage, strength and bravery.
If sexual and domestic violence, sexual slavery, rape and domestic homicide and sex murder continue to be trivialized worldwide and remain almost unpunished, we need not be surprised that women, girls, female children and female babies around the world are experiencing a global cruel genocide. A female holocaust that threatens the future of humanity: Sexual and domestic crimes, murders and femicide must punished with the strictest penalties in the world, otherwise one day there will be no more women in the world and that will be very soon!
Don't tell women, girls and female childs how to dress and look beautiful. It's more important to tell them to learn to defend themselves and to fight. The day may come, that this saves their lives. Self defense is a human right and human rights are women right's.
The emergence of the #MeToo movementin the aftermath of the scandals surrounding movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and television personalities Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly has led to a rise in public scrutiny over the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements in settlements. These agreements can be incredibly pernicious contracts when they are used to silence sexual abuse. Allowing victims to speak out is a necessary form of prevention because it exposes the pattern of abuse, warns those who might become victims, and encourages others similarly situated to come forward with their own claims.
The silence, secrecy and shame that surrounds victims and survivors of child sexual assault are the
offender’s best friend and our children’s worst enemy. Silence and secrecy are always the facilitator,
rarely the solution. Criminalising a victim/survivor’s right to speak out and break their silence, to
identify themselves as a victim of sexual harm not only perpetuates the harm, disempowerment and fear
experienced by survivors but it is a breach of the their human rights. This response can cause just as
much harm as the offending itself. Victims of sexual assault have had so much taken from them by the
offender, to then have a system further strip them of their rights to have a voice, to share their story
without shame, to regain control of their lives, can have serious unintended adverse impacts.
Our demand worldwide must be:
Perpetrators of abuse are held accountable!
They are not to retain positions of power or authority, they must demonstrate they are able to function without perpetuating abuse, rape, coercive or controlling behaviours.
Victim-Survivors of rape and sexual violence must be supported and not held responsible for the behaviours of rapists, predators and abusers.
Victim surviours should have the right to speak out about their sexual assault and rape without fear of legal repuccusion.
The ever growing momentum behind feminist movements has encouraged women to speak up and demand for equal rights. This progress should not go unrecognised, as women are beginning to receive more opportunities, respect, protection and empowerment. However, one ongoing oppressive tendency includes the silencing of women.
I believe that the endless silencing of women can be explained by assessing the structure of society. The capitalist and patriarchal society, which can be found all around the globe, depends on women remaining silent in order for its existence. When women remain silent, society can be complicit and oppression can continue.
I'm a trade unionist and women's rights activist and I know what I'm talking about. I was also tried to be silenced online, with defamation and hate campaigns, sexual deepfakes, identity theft and hacker attacks, with threats of murder and rape online. But I won't keep quiet, because if we keep quiet, the perpetrators won. Of course it's dangerous. Life in the womb is already dangerous for female people, because how many female fetuses are aborted worldwide, isn't it? If we don't fight back, we've already lost.
We must say enough. It’s time to End the Silence on Sexual and Gender Based  Violence.

<p>And now, it's officially agreed and concluded by law that Johnny was never a wife-beater, an abusive character from the beginning and everything was made up by Amber Heard,</p>
<p>Therefore, our request is simple and straightforward, we demand some compensating acts from a couple of companies that had acted rashly when the Op-ed came out to immediately cut off any relationship with Johnny Depp back in 2018/2019.</p>
<p>First, Disney. Disney is a successive film franchise producing company, not only it is responsible for its movies, and actors. The most important thing is the audience. Disney's action of cutting off Johnny Depp from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and Fantastic Beast franchise not only impacted Johnny Depp but the audience around the world. We, the audience, had high expectations towards the character and Disney should also be responsible to us, as it is us who led to Disney's success, without audience support for Disney's product, Disney would not have come to the current stage. Therefore, we would demand a public apology made by Disney regarding its reckless act against Johnny Depp. </p>
<p>Second, since the trial came out as Amber Heard did defame Johnny Depp in the Washington post's Op-ed, we would demand Washington Post take down the article at once to prevent the spreading of misleading information.</p>
<p>Third, we would also demand that L'Oréal, which Amber has been their global ambassador since 2018 end their partnership to clarify that they are not in support of any aspersive influencer.</p>
<p>Fourth, both ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) and OHCHR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights) should take down her position as ambassador for women's rights and Human Rights Champion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We hope by signing this petition, at least we can bring Johnny Depp his justice back, and show him that the world now knows the truth and that society will not let him down once again. Moreover, those companies who acted thoughtlessly should be willing to bravely stand up to admit their mistakes, and the unfair devastated outcome brought towards Johnny Depp.</p>",,Johnny Depp receive his well-deserved Justice back in the society,,,,GB,55.3781,-3.43597,,,,,johnny-depp-receive-his-well-deserved-justice-back-in-the-society,published,,,False,False,,False,,[],True,False,,18,18,0,109,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226661172,photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-400x400-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-400x225-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,1600,900,photo,1215903577,1215903577,Elvis,Barret,Elvis,Elvis Barret,Cardiff,WLS,GB,,en-GB,,[],12,1654483275,2,1654140683,4,1654141810.766,[],False,False,False,Elvis Barret,Johnny Depp receive his well-deserved Justice back in the society,Johnny Depp receive his well-deserved Justice back in the society,active,100,226661172,photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-400x400-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-400x225-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/2/hg/at/kKHGATvoyKMYUUb-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1654137412,False,1600,900,photo,18
