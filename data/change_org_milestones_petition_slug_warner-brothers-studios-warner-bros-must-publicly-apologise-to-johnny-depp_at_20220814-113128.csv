StarterPetitionUpdate,28036377,2020-11-09T11:25:44.000Z,,"Share more! I'm  not popular or a public person and it's hard to get more signatures, I need your he","<p>Please share more, this needs to take off as it would do Johnny so good after all the abuse and injustice, to receive public appologies from Warner Bros. The WB firing him only weighed down even more on his mental health after being made to feel not believed, not listened to, unable to defend himself  and also useless and ""washed off"" in his career. As you might have read, Amber has repeatedly spat these words in his face ""you're old, you're  fat, you're  washed off and your career is over. You'll die a lonely old man"". The fact that he loved her alot made these words pierce in his soul and self esteem.  This is psichological haressment. So imagine being Johnny, sliding towards depression and uncertainty about your person and career and then WB coming  and firing you. WB are actually guilty of teaming up with the abuser and adding up to the abuse! So please if you care, share share share this a thousand times and make it become viral!!! Thank you!</p>",,,
