They are still likening the military sash to “individual recognition” instead of a military honor and right to wear. Although disappointed, it’s exactly what I expected given the resistance to change and the “good ole boys club” mentality. Meaningful change is never easy to achieve, and rest assured we’ll keep working avenues in the background to #honorouryoungservicemembers. Please continue to share and sign!</p>",,,,
