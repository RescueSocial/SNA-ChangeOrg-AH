<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>
<p>Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>
<p>Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>

<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted.

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls. </p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser. </p>
<p>Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.</p>

783791860,"“If we are to fight discrimination and injustice against women we must start from the home for if a woman cannot be safe in her own house then she cannot be expected to feel safe anywhere.”
― Aysha Taryam 

“[V]iolence against women is a key element in this new global war, not only because of the horror it evokes or the messages it sends but because of what women represent in their capacity to keep their communities together and, equally important, to defend noncommercial conceptions of security and wealth.”
― Silvia Federici, Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women 

We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as I will show with my cases and examples, of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, namely my inhuman violent sexually sadistic brother-in-law and my hateful sexually perverse and extremely manipulative ex-tenant.
Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.

Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny/Kate Manne (Autor)
Misogyny is a hot topic, yet it's often misunderstood. What is misogyny, exactly? Who deserves to be called a misogynist? How does misogyny contrast with sexism, and why is it prone to persist - or increase - even when sexist gender roles are waning? This book is an exploration of misogyny in public life and politics by the moral philosopher and writer Kate Manne. It argues that misogyny should not be understood primarily in terms of the hatred or hostility some men feel toward all or most women. Rather, it's primarily about controlling, policing, punishing, and exiling the ""bad"" women who challenge male dominance. And it's compatible with rewarding ""the good ones,"" and singling out other women to serve as warnings to those who are out of order. It's also common for women to serve as scapegoats, be burned as witches, and treated as pariahs.
Manne examines recent and current events such as the Isla Vista killings by Elliot Rodger, the case of the convicted serial rapist Daniel Holtzclaw, who preyed on African-American women as a police officer in Oklahoma City, Rush Limbaugh's diatribe against Sandra Fluke, and the ""misogyny speech"" of Julia Gillard, then Prime Minister of Australia, which went viral on YouTube. The book shows how these events, among others, set the stage for the 2016 US presidential election. Not only was the misogyny leveled against Hillary Clinton predictable in both quantity and quality, Manne argues it was predictable that many people would be prepared to forgive and forget regarding Donald Trump's history of sexual assault and harassment. For this, Manne argues, is misogyny's oft-overlooked and equally pernicious underbelly: exonerating or showing ""himpathy"" for the comparatively privileged men who dominate, threaten, and silence women.

Gendertrolling: How Misogyny Went Viral/Karla Mantilla (Autor)
Gendertrolling arises out of the same misogyny that fuels other ""real life"" forms of harassment and abuse of women. This book explains this phenomenon, the way it can impact women's lives, and how it can be stopped.
 Combines the phenomenon of trolling and keen feminist insight to create a unique perspective on the treatment of women, male/female interaction, and online user interaction
 Demonstrates what online rape and death threats have in common with street harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace, domestic violence, and date rape, showing the serious, harmful nature of this practice
 Discusses what can be done to change laws and Internet policies to increase women's freedom of speech and safety online.

A Brief History of Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice (Brief Histories)/ Jack Holland (Autor)
In this compelling, powerful book, highly respected writer and commentator Jack Holland sets out to answer a daunting question: how do you explain the oppression and brutalization of half the world's population by the other half, throughout history?
The result takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through centuries, continents and civilizations as it looks at both historical and contemporary attitudes to women. Encompassing the Church, witch hunts, sexual theory, Nazism and pro-life campaigners, we arrive at today's developing world, where women are increasingly and disproportionately at risk because of radicalised religious belief, famine, war and disease. Well-informed and researched, highly readable and thought-provoking, this is no outmoded feminist polemic: it's a refreshingly straightforward investigation into an ancient, pervasive and enduring injustice. It deals with the fundamentals of human existence -- sex, love, violence -- that have shaped the lives of humans throughout history.
The answer? It's time to recognize that the treatment of women amounts to nothing less than an abuse of human rights on an unthinkable scale. A Brief History of Misogyny is an important and timely book that will make a long-lasting contribution to the efforts to improve those rights throughout the world.

Misogyny and Media in the Age of Trump (Communicating Gender)/
Maria B. Marron (Herausgeber)
This book explores misogyny across media ranging from political and editorial cartoons to news, sport, film, television, social media (especially Twitter), and journalistic organizations that address gender inequities.

Beyond Blurred Lines: Rape Culture in Popular Media/Nickie D Phillips (Autor)
Beyond Blurred Lines explores the ways that the concept of “rape culture” resonates in popular media. This book demonstrates that popular culture, mass media, and social media are prominent sites for understanding and responding to sexual violence.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Autor)
Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. And, as Gail Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. Proving that porn desensitizes and actually limits our sexual freedom, Dines argues its omnipresence is a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town/Jon Krakauer (Autor)
Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, home to a highly regarded state university whose beloved football team inspires a passionately loyal fan base. Between January 2008 and May 2012, hundreds of students reported sexual assaults to the local police. Few of the cases were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.
In these pages, acclaimed journalist Jon Krakauer investigates a spate of campus rapes that occurred in Missoula over a four-year period. Taking the town as a case study for a crime that is sadly prevalent throughout the nation, Krakauer documents the experiences of five victims: their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the skepticism directed at them by police, prosecutors, and the public; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them. These stories cut through abstract ideological debate about acquaintance rape to demonstrate that it does not happen because women are sending mixed signals or seeking attention. They are victims of a terrible crime, deserving of fairness from our justice system. Rigorously researched, rendered in incisive prose, Missoula stands as an essential call to action.

Fraternity Gang Rape: Sex, Brotherhood, and Privilege on Campus /Peggy Reeves Sanday (Autor)
This widely acclaimed and meticulously documented volume illustrates, in painstaking and disturbing detail, the nature of fraternity gang rape. Drawing on interviews with both victims and fraternity members, Peggy Reeves Sanday reconstructs daily life in the fraternity, highlighting the role played by pornography, male bonding, and degrading, often grotesque, initiation and hazing rituals.
In a substantial new introduction and afterword, Sanday updates the incidences of fraternity gang rape on college campuses today, highlighting such recent cases as that of Duke University and others in the headlines. Sanday also explores the nature of hazing at sororities on campus and how Greek life in general contributes to a culture which promotes the exploitation and sexual degradation of women on campus. More broadly, Sanday examines the nature of campus life today and the possibility of creating a rape-free campus culture.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us/Rachel Louise Snyder (Autor)
An award-winning journalist's intimate investigation of the true scope of domestic violence, revealing how the roots of America's most pressing social crises are buried in abuse that happens behind closed doors.
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.
In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don't know we're seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths-that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

See What You Made Me Do: Power, Control and Domestic Violence /Jess Hill (Autor)
""Women are abused or killed by their partners at astonishing rates- in Australia, almost 17 per cent of women over the age of fifteen - one in six - have been abused by an intimate partner. In this confronting and deeply researched account, journalist Jess Hill uncovers the ways in which abusers exert control in the darkest - and most intimate - ways imaginable. She asks- What do we know about perpetrators? Why is it so hard to leave? What does successful intervention look like? What emerges is not only a searing investigation of the violence so many women experience, but a dissection of how that violence can be enabled and reinforced by the judicial system we trust to protect us. Combining exhaustive research with riveting storytelling, See What You Made Me Do dismantles the flawed logic of victim-blaming and challenges everything you thought you knew about domestic and family violence.""--Publisher's description.

Stalkers and their Victims /Paul E. Mullen (Autor)
Stalking has moved from being a novel area for study to become a core area of concern for mental health professionals, lawyers and other members of the criminal justice system. It has emerged as a significant social problem which not only commands considerable public attention but is now, in many jurisdictions, a specific form of criminal offence. This new edition brings the reader completely up-to-date with the explosion in published research and clinical studies in the field, and covers new issues such as cyberstalking, stalking health professionals, stalking in the workplace, female stalkers, juvenile stalkers, stalking celebrities, evaluating risk in the stalking situation, as well as exploring changes to the legal status of the behaviour. Illustrated with case studies throughout, this is the definitive guide and reference for anyone with professional, academic or other interests in this complex behaviour.

Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online/ Bailey Poland (Autor)
Cybersexism is rampant and can exact an astonishingly high cost. In some cases, the final result is suicide.
Bullying, stalking, and trolling are just the beginning. Extreme examples such as GamerGate get publicized, but otherwise the online abuse of women is largely underreported. Haters combines a history of online sexism with suggestions for solutions.
Using current events and the latest available research into cybersexism, Bailey Poland questions the motivations behind cybersexist activities and explores methods to reduce footprints of Internet misogyny, drawing parallels between online and offline abuse. By exploring the cases of Alyssa Funke, Rehtaeh Parsons, Audrie Pott, Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu, and others, and her personal experiences with sexism, Poland develops a compelling method of combating sexism online.

Misogyny Re-Loaded / Abigail Bray
Blending personal experience with rigorous study, this explosive manifesto rails against what it presents as the resurgent sexual fascism of the new world order. By exposing everything from the casual acceptance of snuff pornography in ""gore"" culture to the framing of rape as a punch line, Abigail Bray links the celebration of sexual sadism to the rise of an authoritarian culture of militarized violence.
Arguing that a meaningful collective resistance has been undermined by the mass destruction of genuine social and economic security for ordinary women, ""Misogyny Re-loaded"" presents a scathing critique of a politically convenient, billionaire-friendly, mainstream brand of feminism. Drawing on a wide range of resources from popular culture, literature, economics, psychiatry, psychology, philosophy, and environmental science, this book offers a warning about the growing social and environmental threat of an out-of-control military industrial complex.

Paid For: My Journey Through Prostitution/Rachel Moran (Author)
An astonishingly brave memoir of prostitution and its lingering influence on a woman’s psyche and life.
“The best work by anyone on prostitution ever, Rachel Moran’s Paid For fuses the memoirist’s lived poignancy with the philosopher’s conceptual sophistication. The result is riveting, compelling, incontestable. Impossible to put down. This book provides all anyone needs to know about the reality of prostitution in moving, insightful prose that engages and disposes of every argument ever raised in its favor.” ―Catharine A. MacKinnon, law professor, University of Michigan and Harvard University
Born into a troubled family, Rachel Moran left home at the age of fourteen. Being homeless, she was driven into prostitution to survive. With intelligence and empathy, she describes the exploitation she and others endured on the streets and in the brothels. Moran also speaks to the psychological damage inherent to prostitution and the inevitable estrangement from one’s body. At twenty-two, Moran escaped the sex trade. She has since become a writer and an abolitionist activist.

Not for Sale: Feminists Resisting Prostitution and Pornography / Rebecca Whisnant (Editor),
Christine Stark (Editor)
Including the latest research on prostitution and pornography, this essay anthology shows how the sex industries harm those within them while undermining the possibilities for gender justice, human equality, and stable sexual relationships. From sex industries survivors to social activists and theorists such as Taylor Lee, Adriene Sere, and Kristen Anderberg, this volume assesses from a feminist perspective the racism, poverty, militarism, and corporate capitalism of selling sex through strip clubs, brothels, mail-order brides, and child pornography.

The Pimping of Prostitution: Abolishing the Sex Work Myth/Julie Bindel (Author)
This book examines one of the most contested issues facing feminists, human rights activists and governments around the globe – the international sex trade. For decades, the liberal left has been conflicted as to whether pro-prostitution activists or abolitionists hold the correct view, and debates are ongoing as to who holds the key to the solutions facing the women and girls involved.

The Road of Lost Innocence / Somaly Mam
In Cambodia, girls as young as five are sold into prostitution every day. Somaly Mam was one such girl. Abandoned as a baby, Somaly was looked after by her grandmother until she disappeared. She was then taken into the care of a man she called 'grandfather', but was treated no better than an unpaid servant. Raped at twelve and forced to marry at fifteen, Somaly was then sold to a brothel. After years of abuse she managed to escape, and went on to co-found AFESIP to combat the sexual trafficking of young girls and women.
Somaly Mam has become an international figure and won a Glamour magazine Woman of the Year award in 2006.

No One Wants You: A True Story Of A Child Forced Into Prostitution / Celine Roberts
Given away by her mother at five months old, raped on the day of her first communion at age seven - when Celine Roberts was told 'No one wants you', she believed it.
Illegitimate and unwanted, Celine was forced by her foster mother into prostitution. Her bones were broken, her nose was crushed and she ate candle wax to stay alive.
Celine was finally rescued and sent to an industrial school, where she picked up the pieces of her shattered life. She also began the search for her parents. But what she found gave her battered survival instincts the hardest knock of all...
Full of the most heartbreaking tragedy but ultimately survival and hope, No One Wants You is the remarkably honest and compelling memoir of a woman triumphing over her brutal past.

Marital Rape: Consent, Marriage, and Social Change in Global Context / Kersti Yllö (Editor), M. Gabriela Torres (Editor) 
Rape in marriage is a global problem affecting millions of women -- it is still legal in many countries and was only criminalized in all U.S. states in 1993. In much of the world, marital rape is too often understood as an oxymoron due to the fact that the ideology of permanent consent underlies the legal and cultural definitions of sex in marriage. From Vietnam to Guatemala to South Africa and beyond, this volume examines how cultural, legal, public health, and human rights policies and practices impact intimate partner violence. While legal and cultural conceptions of marital rape vary widely -- from criminal assault to wifely duty -- this volume offers evidence from different societies that forced sex undermines the physical and psychological well-being of the women who experience it, regardless of their cultural context.
Globally, the nature of marriage is changing and so are notions of individual choice, love, intimacy, and rigid gender roles. Marital Rape documents wide ranging and fluid understandings of sex, consent, and rape in marriage; such an array of perspectives demands an international and interdisciplinary approach to the study of sex and gender-based violence. This text brings together an international group of scholars from the fields of anthropology, sociology, criminology, law, public health, and human rights; their work points to the importance of understanding the lived experience of sexual violence for the design of effective and culturally sensitive public policy and practice.

Child Brides, Global Consequences: How to End Child Marriage/Gayle Tzemach Lemmon (Author), Lynn S. ElHarake (Author) 
One-third of the world's girls are married before the age of eighteen, limiting both their educational and economic potential. Child marriage is damaging to global prosperity and stability, yet despite the urgency of the issue, there remains a significant lack of data on the subject. Senior Fellow Gayle Tzemach Lemmon discusses both the factors that contribute to and strategies that have proved effective against child marriage.

YEARS of SHAME: FGM Survivor & Other True Stories/Wanjiru Warama (Author)
YEARS of SHAME tells the story of a young Kenyan girl's family's decision that she should undergo the traditional ritual circumcision to mark her movement from childhood into adulthood. But the event affects far more than her physical body. The psychological effects are much more traumatic with long lasting negative impact. Even a move from Africa to the United States does not erase the impact since she must again and again face doctors who haven't experienced the medical or psychological complications. Instead of finding support, she finds misunderstanding and she feels prejudice.
Wanjiru Warama's novella compassionately conveys Njana's, the protagonist's, story, sprinkling it with commentary to explain the ritual to the audience. Though reluctant to admit what was done to her because of the shame she feels, Njana is forced to turn to medical professionals whose lack of understanding only add to her discomfort. 

Price of Honor: Muslim Women Lift the Veil of Silence on the Islamic World/Jan Goodwin (Author)
“Explains powerfully how Muslim women are affected by the rise of fundamentalism.”—Dan Rather
In recent years, the expanding movement of militant Islam has changed the way millions think, behave, dress, and live, but nowhere has its impact been more powerfully felt than in its dramatic, often devastating effect on the lives of women. Award-winning journalist Jan Goodwin traveled through ten Islamic countries and interviewed hundreds of Muslim women, from professionals to peasants, from royalty to rebels.  The result is an unforgettable journey into a world where women are confined, isolated, even killed for the sake of a “code of honor” created and zealously enforced by men. 
Price of Honor brings to life a world in which women have become pawns in a bitter power game, and gives readers a provocative look inside Muslim society today—in their own words.

Stolen Sisters: The Story of Two Missing Girls, Their Families, and How Canada Has Failed Indigenous Women/ Emmanuelle Walter (Author) 
In 2014, the nation was rocked by the brutal violence against young Aboriginal women Loretta Saunders, Tina Fontaine and Rinelle Harper. But tragically, they were not the only Aboriginal women to suffer that year. In fact, an official report revealed that since 1980, 1,200 Canadian Aboriginal women have been murdered or have gone missing. This alarming official figure reveals a national tragedy and the systemic failure of law enforcement and of all levels of government to address the issue.
Journalist Emmanuelle Walter spent two years investigating this crisis and has crafted a moving representative account of the disappearance of two young women, Maisy Odjick and Shannon Alexander, teenagers from western Quebec, who have been missing since September 2008. Via personal testimonies, interviews, press clippings and official documents, Walter pieces together the disappearance and loss of these two young lives, revealing these young women to us through the voices of family members and witnesses.
Stolen Sisters is a moving and deeply shocking work of investigative journalism that makes the claim that not only is Canada failing its First Nations communities, but that a feminicide is taking place.

She was only four years old when she was sold into the sex trade. White picket fences and steepled churches all guarded secrets that were not ever supposed to be told. In kindergarten, she began praying every night that Jesus would let her die. In second grade, she sat in church on a Sunday morning swinging her feet from a wooden pew behind the man who had paid to rape her the night before. Her perpetrators were from all walks of life. An engineer, a police officer, a bait shop owner, business men, farmers, younger men and old; different men all feeding the same lust. The only thing that they had in common was their brutal love for little girls.
She shouldn’t have survived it. If God had answered her prayers, she wouldn’t have. Here is the true account of how she was brought out of captivity and into a life of freedom.

These are my shocking experiences:.

First I was and I am a honest girl and woman, hard working at school, High School and Workplace. Goodlooking and with no sexy dresses. A hardworking wife and mother, fighting for women's rights, girls and childrens rights and human rights, for animal rights and for a clean and good environment. I am a very careful person. But inspite of this, I met many psychopaths and evil persons. Nobody is an island of safety and nobody can say, that evil things cannot crosssing the way of life, every day and every time:


The cases I'll describe in more detail!

Here is a short overview!

I was hunted and stalked on the way to school by a traveling salesman from the area of Aachen at the age of 8 to 10 years for two years (1963-1965) by the car. Female neighbors who had seen from the window, that a anonymous car was chasing me, said viciously laughing to my shocked old grandmother, that I was a little slut, if that would already start with men and cars, then I would eventually end up on the street prostitution. None of these stupid and vicious women called the police or anyone else to help, though they saw that in my desperation I ran across the fields for my life. He wanted to abduct me and rape me and perhaps kill me. All the time he cried out of the car, he has a little girl as me at home, I must fear nothing. In the back of his car, so I can see it, he had a notebook with female nude photos.The last time the man chased me with the car and tried to pull me in the car, I slammed the car door from the outside and clamped his arm in the car door and then ran away over fields, fields and scrub where he could not follow with the car. I saw on his hand a ring, he was married. He verbally abused me out of the car, called me a little slut and whore and threatened to kill me. Nevertheless, this behavior has saved me. Although the offender was tall and strong, I escaped. At that time, I was telling everything to my teacher and classmates which were trying to ambush the man to grab him. This thing ended with schoolmates and my former teacher, who ambushed the offender and expelled him, but I did not get any help from women.

In high school at the age of 17, I was massively harassed, terrorized and stalked by a classmate (1972-1976). There were female idiots in my class who thought I should finally sleep with him, so that calm would enter the class. It was known, that my harasser was an sexual sadist, because he was a great fan of the misogynist films, ""The last Tango of Paris"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Some stupid girls said, that I am an impertinence with my resistance for the whole class. Because of the fact, the stalker had girl friends in the class, it was planned, that these girls should lure me to a party where I would then be put forcefully under alcohol and drugs and he wanted to gang rape me with numerous friendsn, male classmates warned me, from the concerned girls no warning came. And when he tried every day to throw his heavy school backpack on my head for long-distance practice, which could have ended in a hit with serious or fatal injuries, male classmates intervened, some more than mindless girls were very amused over the show and thought that I should see it as casual fun. He defamed me in the whole school and called me a mad slut. What a heinous human pig! He left the school without passed exame. On a rainy night (I had already left school after passing the exam) he beheaded all the flowers and roses below my bedroom window and trampled all the beds in the garden with his very large shoes. The tracks could be seen the next morning. He made telephone terror together with other unknown guys for many years and drifted around the house at night. Destroyed all the flowers under my bedroom window on the ground floor at night and always showed with threatening looks at my station.The help for me came by male classmates and a female subject teacher, one of the few women in my life that really helped me.
Later, when I had started training in another city, he was seen several times with unknown young men in my train compartment, where they passed me with a sneering smile, then another friend of him was one day suddenly in my company canteen, where he was looking menacingly and silently sat down at my table and also my classmate stalker and two male friends threw me one day powerfully an old umbrella from behind in my back in the main station, so that the umbrella broke. So much for the harmlessness of stalkers.

During my first year at the workplace at the age of 18, I became the victim of a rape attempt by a senior colleague. My successful resistance was dismissed as outrageous and unnormal, especially among stupid women who had gone to sleeping around to make carreer, they said if I was thinking to be anything better then the other women. These mindless women bullied me instead of supporting me. I have at that time the support of my boss and a another male collague. For me, it was not surprising that the harasser had an absolutely disgusting porn calender in his office and in my presence he was constantly talking about whether I could compete with these porn stars and show if I have such a figure. My complaints had the loud mocking laughter of the men and the indignation of the absolutely dumbfounded women to say that porn and prostitution were normal and would prevent rapes and only someone who was not right in the head, like me, would be bothered by this porn calender. However, as we learn from the media / criminal cases and crimonological and scientific studies on a daily basis, increasing pornography and prostitution since the sixties has led to worldwide sexual femicide in all countries, especially in Africa, Asia, South America and all Muslim countries/ Arab / Hindu countries. When at the birthday party of my boss a friend of the harasser massively sexually molested me so in that kind that I gave him a hard slap in the face and he wanted to beat me in front of all colleagues who participated with their family in the celebration, it was some men who intervened and helped me. These absolutely totally stupid women on the party said that I was the troublemaker and the wife of the boss had to drive me home to the indignation of the female guests. Mind you, not the harasser, a family man had to leave the celebration, but me. I was bullied for three years (1973-1976)by all horny men and silly women, sleeping around in this authority because of my resilience to the rape and sexual harassment that forced me to quit my civil service.

And when my ex-tenant (a Bosnian muslim with Australian nationality) stalked me at the age of 48 and terrorized unti to this day (2004-2020), there were very stupid women in the forum for stalking victims who sided with the stalker and called me a liar, and they were totally brainlessfemale friends of the stalker, who have bully me ever with anonymously calls, laughing at the phone and always sending me English-language love-couple reunion hotlines on my birthday and New Year's Eve. No trace of female solidarity, only of mockery and terror. Apparently it makes these stupid women happy to blame and bully the victims not the culprits. They were so silly, that they have not noticed, that my Ex-tenant has make many BDSM revenge porns of them, sending me these porns with anonymous E-Mails, calling all women and girls sluts. No comment to the stupity of these women and girls.
I think the things that have happened on this matter are far from harmless. Already at the beginning of the rental period we suddenly received sadistic porn emails and had extreme cyberstalking problems and our young tenant with a lilltle girl child on the apartment at the ground floor complained above the apartment of the tenant, about footprints in the snow on her terrace and that she was apparently being watched by night. That was the female tenant, where the mother later suspected that she had been raped and blackmailed by our ex-tenant. But that was not all, because after lending monthly sanitary napkins to his girlfriend, a few days later our rubbish was scattered across the yard and my used sanitary napkins were scattered around. The night before, when I returned from a trip with a femalegood friend, the trash lid was closed and everything was fine. My husband asked our ex-tenant and this evil man claimed that the real culprits of that were birds, my girlfriend said after that, we should get rid of this dangerous madman.
Our tenant told my husband that he went to German schools in Bavaria and Hesse and that he was a student of the Swinbourne University in Melbourne, which became apparent for example later when I was in a network for stalking victims based in Hesse in December 2004 and was bullied out within two days. The perpetrator (my e-tenant) and acquaintances contacted the administrator directly, pleaded innocence, and made sure that I was no longer anonymous. I just wonder what such a person has to do in a forum for stalking victims. The most beloved place for stalkers and cyberstalkers are the social networks for victims believe me! A pen pal told me that he found out that the perpetrator really did go to comprehensive school in Hesse and that he believed that the perpetrators and his friends had been active stalked women and girls for fun for a long time, and that the perpetrator would also have these friends asked for help in this social network, even his stupid female friends. When my ex-tenant had visiting friends from Bavaria in summer 2004, these idiots showed up near my work place and grinned cheekily at me, mind you, before my ex-tenant had previously asked my husband where I work. I ask you, what these guys hat do do at my workplace, very strange or..But that was not all, when I went on holiday to Bavaria with my old parents and my lilltle son after the tenant moved out, I suddenly had the twin brother of my ex-tenant(so he looks like) on the Hotel balcony at night, the grandparents heard the nightly noise, but thought nothing of it because they had the room near me and there were a lot of young people in the hotel. During the same vacation, I suddenly had many anonymous love messages on my e-mail, which the local cell phone provider, to whom I complained, could not clarify my big problems. Immediately after the holiday, I had a kangaroo postcard of my ex-tenant in the mailbox to my son, mind you without a stamp, our tenant claimed that he was back in Australia and the stamp had fallen off on the way. Who believes that?
In April 2006, I also received love messages on my mail, in which I was called an angel. After I deleted it unanswered, my son's elementary school burned down at night. Arson suspected, perpetrator unknown.
In 2006, a female Canadian friend invited me to a network that was not very careful with data protection, because you were shown with a photo and location on a world map, which I didn't know at first. After two days I was bullied out and the girlfriend was also bothered with stalking and break-ins. In 2010 she had found out something about my tenant together with her daughter, so she wanted to visit me in Germany and tell me everything about. It never happened because her daughter was so brutally raped by foreign men that she was severely traumatized and disabled, for example, she was unable to walk afterwards. My female pen friend broke off contact with me and I didn't find out what she wanted to tell me. In August 2010, when I was in the wine village celebration in my city with a female friend, I saw my ex-tenant with four women in a cafe, two of whom were blond. He looked very aggressive, like a Panthr on the go, seemed pretty unshaven and I quickly walked away from the entrance to the cafe.
In February 2008 I happened to meet him on the tram, where he grinned so maliciously at me during his glasses (the first time I saw himd with glasses) that I changed my seat on the train. He got out at the tram stop, where he met a red-curly-haired very young girl. Both of them followed me into the stairwell of an ophthalmologist, where I had an appointment, after a violent dispute with each other, the two disappeared. In autumn 2008 I suddenly received threatening emails that I was a lesbian and homosexuals had to die, I thought, what's the point? In April 2009 I found out through the media that a friend of the ex-tenant had been found dead in South Sydney in autumn 2008 with 34 nails in his head. At the time, when I asked to find out whether the ex-tenant really was in Australia, a pen friend found him on Facebook and showed me his closest contacts whether I had ever seen one of these men in my area, including this murdered Chinese. The picture of this murdered man in Facebook was the same as in the media, with flowers in his back. Of course I wonder who murdered this poor person so brutally, right?
Here the report of the police in April 2009:
""Police have released a gruesome photo showing how a Sydney man was shot in the head and neck with a nail gun 34 times.
27-year-old Chen Liu, who also went by the name of Anthony Liu, was found dead in marshland surrounding the Georges River in Sydney's south last year.
Police say the severely decomposed body was found just after 6:00pm (AEDT) on 1 November 2008 by two children, aged 9 and 14, who told their parents they had seen a body in Oatley Bay while on a canoeing trip.
Police say Mr Liu had been dead for 12 days before being discovered.
The Homicide Squad has been handling the case in conjunction with the Hurstville Local Area Command, forming Strike Force Renfree, but so far no arrests have been made.
They have now released an X-ray of the 27-year-old's skull and neck, which shows it was filled with 34 nails.
""Post-mortem examination results revealed Mr Liu was shot repeatedly to the head with a high-powered nail gun. Similar types of nail guns can fire nails up to 85 millimetres long,"" Detective Inspector Mark Newham of the Homicide Squad said in a statement.
The head of the Homicide Squad, Geoff Beresford, says the weapon has not been found.
""If anyone knows of a particular nail gun that has been stolen from them or from work premises, building sites, et cetera, we'd be grateful to hear that information,"" he said.
He says the victim had been in Australia for eight years, but has no family here.
""In 36 years of investigation, I've never come across a murder of this nature using a nail gun,"" he said.
""May I say it's a particularly brutal and vicious murder and we are seeking information from the public so we can bring this inquiry to a conclusion.""
Detective Inspector Newham says information about the victim's car would be useful.
""Strike Force detectives are also appealing for information from anyone who might have seen Mr Liu's car in Rockdale or Connells Point around 19 October 2008,"" he said.
The car is described as a 2005 model blue Range Rover Sport four wheel drive, which police believe may have been used to dump Mr Liu's body in the marshland.
People with information are asked to contact Strike Force Renfree via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000, and police say all information will be treated in strict confidence.""
In the summer of 2009 I had an appointment with a female friend at the harbor festival and my ex-tenant called shortly before I was leaving the house, he knew where I was going and he wished us a lot of fun. I went there anyway with my girlfriend and we had fun and then at the same night the cars of my friend and her daughter, a student, were badly sratched and the police couldn't find out everything. I then told her about my stalking problem and the call. She was very angry, accused me of being responsible for everything, and broke off the contact. Apparently the daughter told someone at the university that we were going to the harbor festival and somehow this information ended up with my ex-tenant, just don't ask me how.
Until today, there were incidents around the house, calls, hacker attacks. In January 2020, three photo orders from me disappeared in a laboratory in Cologne, it was a photo summary from 2004-2019, which was not only funny to me, but to all those involved who issued a search request for the photos, but without success. I had submitted these photo orders within two months.
Since October 2019, all letters to my female Graz pen pal in Austria have disappeared, this is the friend who was massively stalked in 2006, she had several break-ins, gifts at the door, her dog was stolen, the police found nothing, as always, didn't they . During his short rental period, the tenant always traveled to relatives in Graz and Salzburg at the weekend.
The same thing happened to penpals. A male pen pal got anonymous death threats and cut the contact. Another had a over night tampered car and had an accident, he was in hospital and broke off the contact. Just to give two examples that is not all.
In the summer of 2009 I had an appointment with a female friend at the harbor festival and my ex-tenant called shortly beforehand, he knew that  I was going there with a female friend and he wished us a lot of fun. I went there anyway and at night the two cars my female friend and her daughter, a student, were scratched. I then told her about my stalking problem and the call. She was very angry, accused me of being responsible for everything, and broke off the contact. Apparently the daughter told someone at the university that we were going to the harbor festival and somehow this information ended up with my ex-tenant, just don't ask me how.
At the same time, my husband informed me that the tenant had bought a sadistic porn on the same day, when his girlfriend wanted sanitary napkins because of heavy bleeding from me. We knew immediately what had happened. During his short thenant-time he had a girl friend and many One-Night-Stands, but in spite of that, he stalked me. And he defamed me in the neighbour hood as woman, that slept around. After the departure of the tenant informed me the very worried mother of a female tenant in the apartment above him that her daugther was probably drugged with drugs, raped and was now blackmailed. The mother of the female tenant must give her 24.000 €, the daughter said, she had to pay someone at once. But she said her mother not, who he was. Since the female tenant no longer talked to us and then moved out and probably no police turned on, we could unfortunately do nothing. Anonymous murder and rape threats to me were signed with Jack from Hell. I got a photo sent from the blowjob with about a twelve years old girl or younger, I recognized him on the liver spot and dimples on the chin, on the dark hair and the clothes. And I got anonymous many rape porns with E-Mail with calling me a dumb bitch and prostitute.
A pen pal discovered a Bosnian forum where my tenant bragged that he was going to end the conflict with a woman with a bottle in her vagina, attached with a corresponding cruel X-ray image of such a crime. What a sadistic human pig! My tenant was a very tall and very strong man, when I realized that he was planning something evil during his rent time when I was home alone one day, I invited my parents and let them park their car somewhere else. He came then and was very angry when I was not alone, he was sweating heavily, claiming that he wanted to pay me the rent cash today and pulled out a bundle of unbelievable many money , which seemed very strange to me. He is a masterful psychopathic liar, and capable of anything that I know to be evil.
There are also frequent incidents (during the rental period and even today after removal of the tenant) with nocturnal shots below the house, nocturnal destruction of a flower bank, flower pots, outdoor lamps, outdoor cameras, motion detectors, garden furniture in the garden, digging plants and stone steps at night Removal of the garbage containers or paper containers at night with removal of the contents, nightly damage to the company car (scratching, loosening the wheel nuts, piercing the tires).And until now we hear unknown men nightly around the house, under the house and the garden. A girlfriend of mine saw unknown foreign men in cars under the house nightly together with her friend, these people were driving always quickly away when they saw my girlfriend and her friend. Apart from the fact that he did not even pay his monthly newspaper and told the newspaper I would pay it.
Again and again, someone unknown goes around the house at night. When I threw hard fruit out of the skylight several times a night and hit the shadow, I heard from the sounds that it was a man.
Since my ex-tenant had intercepted mail from me during his tenancy and spied constantly in the paper container at night in discarded postal items, he came so to the addresses of girlfriends, penpals and colleagues. These people were massively harassed on the Internet and privately with telephone terror, property damages, break-ins and burglary attempts. A female friend of mine, who lived below my house, was molested by a whole unknown Arab clique (there were a burglary attempt and rape threats connected with harassment and telephone terror) until she threatened with the police. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, I saw this man again and again at longer intervals nearby, near the house, in the tram, the tram stop in my neighborhood, my workplace, near my girlfriend's apartment, either alone or together with an unknown man or an unknown woman, either in changing cars with different license plates or without a car. With beard, glasses, sunglasses or without. My son also saw him differently in the car parks near his school. When I saw him once in front of the shopping center of our district in the morning, my imitated photos were gone for 6 weeks. On a vacation and a cure, I had an unknown very big man at night on the balcony, which was also noticed by others. In addition, we had two private burglary attempts and a break-in attempt in our Austrian apartment and in a cure tried at night an unknown man to invade in my room. When a movie theater we visited, had to be evacuated because of a decaying, stinking dead animal that unknown people had left behind us, my son and his friend saw our ex-tenant with an unknown woman leaving the cinema. In addition, the ex-tenant repeatedly called me with false identities professionally and privately, so in the presence of my son in December 2015, when I was just was released from a serious tumor surgery from the hospital, my ex-tenant called himself Mr. Unterberg. 
Until now there are incidents around the house, calls, hacker attacks. In January 2020, three photo orders from me disappeared in a laboratory in Cologne, it was a photo summary from 2004-2019, which was not only funny to me, and not to all those involved who issued a search request for the photos, but without success. I had submitted these photo orders within two months.
Since October 2019, all letters to my Graz pen pal have disappeared, this is the friend who was massively stalked back in 2006, she had several break-ins, gifts at the door, her dog was stolen, the police found nothing, as always, didn't she .
The same thing happened to penpals. A pen pal got anonymous death threats and cut contact. Another had a tampered car and had an accident and broke off the contact. Just to give two examples is not all.
I was not surprised that I had a very big stranger in my hoodie on my balcony twice during the course of my cure in Hessen in 2007. The noise was heard from patients above and below me. Cigarette butts were found on my balcony, after this incident the clinic hired a security service.n my cure in the Black Forest 2012, a stranger also wanted to open the door at night, but to no avail. The noise was even heard from the floor below, but nobody had seen anything. He probably escaped through the elevator and an unfinished side entrance.
After my tumor operation in December 2015, a tall, dark-haired young man tried to enter my room, where I was still very unconscious, and was driven out by a vigorous old patient. She later complained massively about the incident and the safety precautions, apparently nothing was found out by the clinic, they were somehow not interested in this incident.
I honestly have to say that I'm more fed up with this story, it doesn't seem to end.

And at last one of greatest women haters of all:
My brother-in-law and half-brother of my husband, the super-bully and misogynist:
My brother-in-law, a wealthy and successful independent businessman, with mansions, houses at home and abroad, mobbed and terrorized everyone, invariably, but mostly women and girls. He bullied me from 1974-1986. He was also still a domestic violent offender, who abused my first sister-in-law and his two children and he is always unpunished. Above all, he humiliated my husband without end. He stopped at no one. Whenever we had family reunions, he always came too late, we were not allowed to start drinking coffee he came, otherwise he was raging. His wife and children always came with blow marks, he constantly insulted me with sexually disgusting comments. I'm a very quick-witted and courageous person, I think, but I've been nearly assaulted by him on several occasions because I objected and stopped him. In one case he wanted to beat the children and his wife at the birthday table of my mother-in-law before my eyes. I intervened and he said he like beating a bitch like me. After everyone was dumbfounded and trembling with fear, I said, go ahead, I've always wanted to use the bonecrusher trick from my judo course on a living subject. And another time, he said to my mother-in-law's old girlfriends that such women as me he would meet otherwise only in brothels. Yes, I said, it has been rumored that you are the main customer in our city brothel, there was now a syphillis epidemic. The two old ladies were trembling all over and snow-white. My brother-in-law slandered me from the beginning ( I was at that time 18 years old), for example when I was in my parents' house with severe pneumonia and high fever, he claimed that he had seen me in the old town at late night with strange men and that I was a bitch. My parents didn't want to see him after that anymore. Or when I applied for an apprenticeship at the tax office, he called as my supposed husband there and said that he would forbid me to work there and that I was pregnant. And because of this lie, I didn't get the job.
He beat his first wife during the two pregnancies, he hated children, he forced my first sister-in-law to have three abortions in one year. He also terrorized and harassed the female employees in his tax advisor office. And he kept saying to everyone who wanted to hear it or not, women were only there to fuck and even for that they were too stupid!
He forced my second sister-in-law to sterilization during a holiday abroad, even though she was only 25 years old and definitely wanted children. Then he named her his free hooker. Before his first wedding, he took underaged girls to his room for sex and then literally chased them away saying that they were worthless whores.
My first sister-in-law found in his well-hidden documents before the divorce, evidence that he was constantly having sex with underaged girls abroad, but nobody wanted to get involved.
After a short time there was no contact with my brother-in-law until today. He verbally and physically terrorized and mistreated his female employees in a extreme way for very long years, a father of a underaged female trainee complained to me and my husband that his daughter had almost committed suicide, I could only point out that he must contact a lawyer and police, what else couldnot done. The brother of my husband deceived and decimated all his business associates and friends. They all complained to me and my husband too about this. At the end, the old parents were on the line, first my very ill old father-in-law, whom the brother of my husband accused in the hospital of being a simulant and that he was a case for the psychiatry. When I intervened, he terrorized my mother-in-law, telling her to ban me form visting the ill old man. He did not achieve that. When my father-in-law died, he bullied my seriously ill mother-in-law, along with his second wife, who had just married him for the money and was a true luxury female. When my mother-in-law, whom we cared for on her own, as well as for my father-in-law, although my brother-in-law had five minutes his office and his house away, became ill during our vacation, a female neighbor asked my brother-in-law for help. That was a goddamn mistake, because he pushed the poor old neighbour woman when he came almost down the stairs, screaming in rage, and my mother-in-law was forced by him and my sister-in-law to pack her things and the poor old woman was leave with their suitcases in tears in the doorway of a retirement home. In the meantime, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and playful grandson have looted my mother-in-law's account, along with the cleaning lady, sharing the most valuable stamps and coins from my father-in-law's collections, jewelry, and elegant clothing. When we got our mother-in-law out of the old people's home, the disaster had already happened. My mother-in-law threatened suicide if we went to the police. So she died completely broken in another modern retirement home, because it turned out that she had severe Alzheimer's. Before, my brother-in-law wrote two bad letters, we could take care of her now, he declines any responsibility. Well, evil exists, right.

The female betrayal of female victims is as old as the world. Because of this men worldwide call women dumb and inferior. The female betrayal includes bullying, slander, hate speech, psychoterror, abuse, violence, stalking, participation in FGM, child murder, abortion of female fetuses, femicide, forced marriages, childhood marriages, honor murder, dowry murder, sex murder, sexual torture, acid attacks, witch hunts, sex slavery, rape pornography, forced prostitution. Female treason also means excusing the perpetrators and accusing the victims. This is a worldwide disgrace and must have an end.
No wonder men around the world consider women for stupid and inferior. As long as women and girls behave so unsolidly and meanly, that will remain so.
If you are female and think you are safe at home, at school or at work, my experiences will teach you a better one!

I would advise all women, girls, and female children to learn self-defense and martial arts instead of learning to be beautiful and docile. Because the day could come when it saves their lives.

Later I deterred all the aggressors by telling them I practiced on a Grapfruit in a self-defense course, how to squeeze out the eyes of male aggressors.",0,0,Event,20204830,1,comment,2020-04-21T07:21:59Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],20204830,20204830,Replace Amber heard with Emilia Clarke as Mera in Aquaman 2,2020-02-08T19:54:02Z,,2020-02-08T19:54:21Z,,en-US,['en'],DC COMICS: Replace Amber heard with Emilia Clarke as Mera in Aquaman 2,"<p>Amber Heard has been exposed as a domestic abuser by Johnny Depp. In his $50 million lawsuit, Johnny Depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife Amber Heard, including one incident where she punched him twice in the face and another where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached.
