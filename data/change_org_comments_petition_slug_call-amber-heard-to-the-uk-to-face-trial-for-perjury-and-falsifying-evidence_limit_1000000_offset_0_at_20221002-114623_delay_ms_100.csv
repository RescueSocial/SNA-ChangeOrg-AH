Mr Depp stated that The Sun publishing an edition that labelled him as a ""Wife beater"" had the soul purpose of convincing readers that he had enacted domestic violence upon his intimate partner and to plea for his removal from the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise.</p>
<p>During this trial, The Sun called Amber Heard as a witness. She testified, under oath, that Mr Depp had violently assaulted her on many occasions throughout their relationship and presented audio, video and photographic evidence to support her claims. Consequently, Mr Depp lost the case and was branded an abusive wife beater for the last 6 years.</p>
<p>As a result of this trial, Mr Depp lost his roles in Pirates of The Carribbean (a part that he held so dear that he claims he knew that character better than the writers themselves) and his part of Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Mr Depp suffered immense financial loss as a result, but more importantly, he felt he lost the support of his much loved fans.</p>
<p>Mr Depp sought to clear his name 6 years later, and so, he bought Amber Heard to court over claims of defamation in May 2022. As the hearing has come to a close and the world waits for the verdict of the Jury, we would call for further action against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>As a result of the current defamation trial, several examples of perjury and falsifying evidence during the June 2018 libel case against The Sun have been presented to Ms Heard by Mr Depps' legal team. Including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falsifying bruises in several submitted photos that seemed to disappear in photos taken in the days following the alleged attacks. For examples, Ms Heard submitted an image of herself on the 27th May 2016, in which she can be seen leaving the courthouse after filing for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp. In this image, a bruise can clearly be seen on her right cheekbone. However, in a photo taken the day after this image (evidence that was submitted by Mr Depps' legal team), Ms Heard is seen with her friend Rocky Pennington without a bruise on her right cheek. Promoting Mr Depps' legal team to assume that the bruise was falsified and therefore, the image is falsified evidence.</li>
<li>Lying in her deposition in regards to who informed TMZ of her plans to be at the courthouse on 27th May 2016 in order to file a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp, and who informed TMZ of a bruise that would be present on the right side of Ms Heards' face (the images taken by TMZ photographers on this day were subsequently used as evidence against Mr Depp in the UK trial). Mr Morgan Tremaine, a paparazzi dispatcher who worked for TMZ at the time of the TRO filing stated that he dispatched photographers instantly as the tip had come from a verified source and was, therefore, deemed accurate. He stated that this kind of tip is checked before dispatch occurs and, as the courthouse is not a celebrity hotspot, only a tip off would have printed him to dispatch photographers to the location. Mr Tremaine also stated that there was a plan for Ms Heard to pause at some point in order for the photographers to get a clear shot of the bruise on Ms Heards' face, subsequently providing one of the images used in her evidence for The Sun.</li>
<li>Admitting photographs into evidence that were duplicates of eachother, only altered using editing software to falsify the appearance of bruising to her face. Mr Norbert ""Bryan"" Neumeister, a metadata analysis expert, testified under oath that the EXIF data presented for the photographic evidence Ms Heard submitted showed clear signs of ""modification"" and therefore there was ""no way for any forensic expert to validate any of these photos"".</li>
<li>Editing video footage that she had taken of Mr Depp ""assaulting cabinets"" in their home after Mr Depp learned of the financial loss he had just suffered due to his previous business managers allegedly stealing $650m and leaving him $100m in debt as they had not paid his taxes for the previous 17 years. TMZ paparazzi dispatcher Morgan Tremaine testified that, when TMZ received this video, the unflattering shots of Ms Heard had been removed from the footage, leaving only unflattering footage of Mr Depp.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a small fraction of examples of potential perjury and falsifying evidence that Ms Heard may have enacted during her testimony in the June 2018 legal battle against The Sun, when she submitted these files into evidence under sworn oath of their authenticity.</p>
<p>Perjury is an offence that defamation lawyer Mr Aaron Minc claims ""cuts to the core of our justice system"". The justice system is in place to ensure nobody is above the law and everyone should be held accountable for their actions. It is for this reason that we would call for your signature, to petition the UK justice system/courts/police to begin an investigation into the potential purjury committed by Ms Heard during the June 2018 libel case, and should perjury be discovered, we call for the aforementioned justice system to hold Ms Heard fully accountable for her actions.</p>
<p>The Perjury Act 1911 states that ""If any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding wilfully makes a statement material in that proceeding, which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of perjury, and shall, on conviction thereof on indictment, be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to a fine or to both such penal servitude or imprisonment and fine"".</p>
<p>We therefore request that Ms Heard be called to answer these allegations and, should evidence of perjury be discovered, the appropriate sentence or fine in adherence with the Perjury Act 1911 be applied.</p>
<p>No person should be above the law, regardless of whether or not the individual breaking the law is native to the origin country of said law. We ask that the law be upheld and investigated to the full extent of the justice systems capabilities.

Mr Depp stated that The Sun publishing an edition that labelled him as a ""Wife beater"" had the soul purpose of convincing readers that he had enacted domestic violence upon his intimate partner and to plea for his removal from the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise.</p>
<p>During this trial, The Sun called Amber Heard as a witness. She testified, under oath, that Mr Depp had violently assaulted her on many occasions throughout their relationship and presented audio, video and photographic evidence to support her claims. Consequently, Mr Depp lost the case and was branded an abusive wife beater for the last 6 years.</p>
<p>As a result of this trial, Mr Depp lost his roles in Pirates of The Carribbean (a part that he held so dear that he claims he knew that character better than the writers themselves) and his part of Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Mr Depp suffered immense financial loss as a result, but more importantly, he felt he lost the support of his much loved fans.</p>
<p>Mr Depp sought to clear his name 6 years later, and so, he bought Amber Heard to court over claims of defamation in May 2022. As the hearing has come to a close and the world waits for the verdict of the Jury, we would call for further action against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>As a result of the current defamation trial, several examples of perjury and falsifying evidence during the June 2018 libel case against The Sun have been presented to Ms Heard by Mr Depps' legal team. Including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falsifying bruises in several submitted photos that seemed to disappear in photos taken in the days following the alleged attacks. For examples, Ms Heard submitted an image of herself on the 27th May 2016, in which she can be seen leaving the courthouse after filing for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp. In this image, a bruise can clearly be seen on her right cheekbone. However, in a photo taken the day after this image (evidence that was submitted by Mr Depps' legal team), Ms Heard is seen with her friend Rocky Pennington without a bruise on her right cheek. Promoting Mr Depps' legal team to assume that the bruise was falsified and therefore, the image is falsified evidence.</li>
<li>Lying in her deposition in regards to who informed TMZ of her plans to be at the courthouse on 27th May 2016 in order to file a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp, and who informed TMZ of a bruise that would be present on the right side of Ms Heards' face (the images taken by TMZ photographers on this day were subsequently used as evidence against Mr Depp in the UK trial). Mr Morgan Tremaine, a paparazzi dispatcher who worked for TMZ at the time of the TRO filing stated that he dispatched photographers instantly as the tip had come from a verified source and was, therefore, deemed accurate. He stated that this kind of tip is checked before dispatch occurs and, as the courthouse is not a celebrity hotspot, only a tip off would have printed him to dispatch photographers to the location. Mr Tremaine also stated that there was a plan for Ms Heard to pause at some point in order for the photographers to get a clear shot of the bruise on Ms Heards' face, subsequently providing one of the images used in her evidence for The Sun.</li>
<li>Admitting photographs into evidence that were duplicates of eachother, only altered using editing software to falsify the appearance of bruising to her face. Mr Norbert ""Bryan"" Neumeister, a metadata analysis expert, testified under oath that the EXIF data presented for the photographic evidence Ms Heard submitted showed clear signs of ""modification"" and therefore there was ""no way for any forensic expert to validate any of these photos"".</li>
<li>Editing video footage that she had taken of Mr Depp ""assaulting cabinets"" in their home after Mr Depp learned of the financial loss he had just suffered due to his previous business managers allegedly stealing $650m and leaving him $100m in debt as they had not paid his taxes for the previous 17 years. TMZ paparazzi dispatcher Morgan Tremaine testified that, when TMZ received this video, the unflattering shots of Ms Heard had been removed from the footage, leaving only unflattering footage of Mr Depp.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a small fraction of examples of potential perjury and falsifying evidence that Ms Heard may have enacted during her testimony in the June 2018 legal battle against The Sun, when she submitted these files into evidence under sworn oath of their authenticity.</p>
<p>Perjury is an offence that defamation lawyer Mr Aaron Minc claims ""cuts to the core of our justice system"". The justice system is in place to ensure nobody is above the law and everyone should be held accountable for their actions. It is for this reason that we would call for your signature, to petition the UK justice system/courts/police to begin an investigation into the potential purjury committed by Ms Heard during the June 2018 libel case, and should perjury be discovered, we call for the aforementioned justice system to hold Ms Heard fully accountable for her actions.</p>
<p>The Perjury Act 1911 states that ""If any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding wilfully makes a statement material in that proceeding, which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of perjury, and shall, on conviction thereof on indictment, be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to a fine or to both such penal servitude or imprisonment and fine"".</p>
<p>We therefore request that Ms Heard be called to answer these allegations and, should evidence of perjury be discovered, the appropriate sentence or fine in adherence with the Perjury Act 1911 be applied.</p>
<p>No person should be above the law, regardless of whether or not the individual breaking the law is native to the origin country of said law. We ask that the law be upheld and investigated to the full extent of the justice systems capabilities.

Mr Depp stated that The Sun publishing an edition that labelled him as a ""Wife beater"" had the soul purpose of convincing readers that he had enacted domestic violence upon his intimate partner and to plea for his removal from the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise.</p>
<p>During this trial, The Sun called Amber Heard as a witness. She testified, under oath, that Mr Depp had violently assaulted her on many occasions throughout their relationship and presented audio, video and photographic evidence to support her claims. Consequently, Mr Depp lost the case and was branded an abusive wife beater for the last 6 years.</p>
<p>As a result of this trial, Mr Depp lost his roles in Pirates of The Carribbean (a part that he held so dear that he claims he knew that character better than the writers themselves) and his part of Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Mr Depp suffered immense financial loss as a result, but more importantly, he felt he lost the support of his much loved fans.</p>
<p>Mr Depp sought to clear his name 6 years later, and so, he bought Amber Heard to court over claims of defamation in May 2022. As the hearing has come to a close and the world waits for the verdict of the Jury, we would call for further action against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>As a result of the current defamation trial, several examples of perjury and falsifying evidence during the June 2018 libel case against The Sun have been presented to Ms Heard by Mr Depps' legal team. Including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falsifying bruises in several submitted photos that seemed to disappear in photos taken in the days following the alleged attacks. For examples, Ms Heard submitted an image of herself on the 27th May 2016, in which she can be seen leaving the courthouse after filing for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp. In this image, a bruise can clearly be seen on her right cheekbone. However, in a photo taken the day after this image (evidence that was submitted by Mr Depps' legal team), Ms Heard is seen with her friend Rocky Pennington without a bruise on her right cheek. Promoting Mr Depps' legal team to assume that the bruise was falsified and therefore, the image is falsified evidence.</li>
<li>Lying in her deposition in regards to who informed TMZ of her plans to be at the courthouse on 27th May 2016 in order to file a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp, and who informed TMZ of a bruise that would be present on the right side of Ms Heards' face (the images taken by TMZ photographers on this day were subsequently used as evidence against Mr Depp in the UK trial). Mr Morgan Tremaine, a paparazzi dispatcher who worked for TMZ at the time of the TRO filing stated that he dispatched photographers instantly as the tip had come from a verified source and was, therefore, deemed accurate. He stated that this kind of tip is checked before dispatch occurs and, as the courthouse is not a celebrity hotspot, only a tip off would have printed him to dispatch photographers to the location. Mr Tremaine also stated that there was a plan for Ms Heard to pause at some point in order for the photographers to get a clear shot of the bruise on Ms Heards' face, subsequently providing one of the images used in her evidence for The Sun.</li>
<li>Admitting photographs into evidence that were duplicates of eachother, only altered using editing software to falsify the appearance of bruising to her face. Mr Norbert ""Bryan"" Neumeister, a metadata analysis expert, testified under oath that the EXIF data presented for the photographic evidence Ms Heard submitted showed clear signs of ""modification"" and therefore there was ""no way for any forensic expert to validate any of these photos"".</li>
<li>Editing video footage that she had taken of Mr Depp ""assaulting cabinets"" in their home after Mr Depp learned of the financial loss he had just suffered due to his previous business managers allegedly stealing $650m and leaving him $100m in debt as they had not paid his taxes for the previous 17 years. TMZ paparazzi dispatcher Morgan Tremaine testified that, when TMZ received this video, the unflattering shots of Ms Heard had been removed from the footage, leaving only unflattering footage of Mr Depp.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a small fraction of examples of potential perjury and falsifying evidence that Ms Heard may have enacted during her testimony in the June 2018 legal battle against The Sun, when she submitted these files into evidence under sworn oath of their authenticity.</p>
<p>Perjury is an offence that defamation lawyer Mr Aaron Minc claims ""cuts to the core of our justice system"". The justice system is in place to ensure nobody is above the law and everyone should be held accountable for their actions. It is for this reason that we would call for your signature, to petition the UK justice system/courts/police to begin an investigation into the potential purjury committed by Ms Heard during the June 2018 libel case, and should perjury be discovered, we call for the aforementioned justice system to hold Ms Heard fully accountable for her actions.</p>
<p>The Perjury Act 1911 states that ""If any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding wilfully makes a statement material in that proceeding, which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of perjury, and shall, on conviction thereof on indictment, be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to a fine or to both such penal servitude or imprisonment and fine"".</p>
<p>We therefore request that Ms Heard be called to answer these allegations and, should evidence of perjury be discovered, the appropriate sentence or fine in adherence with the Perjury Act 1911 be applied.</p>
<p>No person should be above the law, regardless of whether or not the individual breaking the law is native to the origin country of said law. We ask that the law be upheld and investigated to the full extent of the justice systems capabilities.

She testified, under oath, that Mr Depp had violently assaulted her on many occasions throughout their relationship and presented audio, video and photographic evidence to support her claims. Consequently, Mr Depp lost the case and was branded an abusive wife beater for the last 6 years.</p>
<p>As a result of this trial, Mr Depp lost his roles in Pirates of The Carribbean (a part that he held so dear that he claims he knew that character better than the writers themselves) and his part of Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Mr Depp suffered immense financial loss as a result, but more importantly, he felt he lost the support of his much loved fans.</p>
<p>Mr Depp sought to clear his name 6 years later, and so, he bought Amber Heard to court over claims of defamation in May 2022. As the hearing has come to a close and the world waits for the verdict of the Jury, we would call for further action against Ms Heard. </p>
<p>As a result of the current defamation trial, several examples of perjury and falsifying evidence during the June 2018 libel case against The Sun have been presented to Ms Heard by Mr Depps' legal team. Including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falsifying bruises in several submitted photos that seemed to disappear in photos taken in the days following the alleged attacks. For examples, Ms Heard submitted an image of herself on the 27th May 2016, in which she can be seen leaving the courthouse after filing for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp. In this image, a bruise can clearly be seen on her right cheekbone. However, in a photo taken the day after this image (evidence that was submitted by Mr Depps' legal team), Ms Heard is seen with her friend Rocky Pennington without a bruise on her right cheek. Promoting Mr Depps' legal team to assume that the bruise was falsified and therefore, the image is falsified evidence.</li>
<li>Lying in her deposition in regards to who informed TMZ of her plans to be at the courthouse on 27th May 2016 in order to file a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Mr Depp, and who informed TMZ of a bruise that would be present on the right side of Ms Heards' face (the images taken by TMZ photographers on this day were subsequently used as evidence against Mr Depp in the UK trial). Mr Morgan Tremaine, a paparazzi dispatcher who worked for TMZ at the time of the TRO filing stated that he dispatched photographers instantly as the tip had come from a verified source and was, therefore, deemed accurate. He stated that this kind of tip is checked before dispatch occurs and, as the courthouse is not a celebrity hotspot, only a tip off would have printed him to dispatch photographers to the location. Mr Tremaine also stated that there was a plan for Ms Heard to pause at some point in order for the photographers to get a clear shot of the bruise on Ms Heards' face, subsequently providing one of the images used in her evidence for The Sun.</li>
<li>Admitting photographs into evidence that were duplicates of eachother, only altered using editing software to falsify the appearance of bruising to her face. Mr Norbert ""Bryan"" Neumeister, a metadata analysis expert, testified under oath that the EXIF data presented for the photographic evidence Ms Heard submitted showed clear signs of ""modification"" and therefore there was ""no way for any forensic expert to validate any of these photos"".</li>
<li>Editing video footage that she had taken of Mr Depp ""assaulting cabinets"" in their home after Mr Depp learned of the financial loss he had just suffered due to his previous business managers allegedly stealing $650m and leaving him $100m in debt as they had not paid his taxes for the previous 17 years. TMZ paparazzi dispatcher Morgan Tremaine testified that, when TMZ received this video, the unflattering shots of Ms Heard had been removed from the footage, leaving only unflattering footage of Mr Depp.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a small fraction of examples of potential perjury and falsifying evidence that Ms Heard may have enacted during her testimony in the June 2018 legal battle against The Sun, when she submitted these files into evidence under sworn oath of their authenticity.</p>
<p>Perjury is an offence that defamation lawyer Mr Aaron Minc claims ""cuts to the core of our justice system"". The justice system is in place to ensure nobody is above the law and everyone should be held accountable for their actions. It is for this reason that we would call for your signature, to petition the UK justice system/courts/police to begin an investigation into the potential purjury committed by Ms Heard during the June 2018 libel case, and should perjury be discovered, we call for the aforementioned justice system to hold Ms Heard fully accountable for her actions.</p>
<p>The Perjury Act 1911 states that ""If any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding wilfully makes a statement material in that proceeding, which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of perjury, and shall, on conviction thereof on indictment, be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to a fine or to both such penal servitude or imprisonment and fine"".</p>
<p>We therefore request that Ms Heard be called to answer these allegations and, should evidence of perjury be discovered, the appropriate sentence or fine in adherence with the Perjury Act 1911 be applied.</p>
<p>No person should be above the law, regardless of whether or not the individual breaking the law is native to the origin country of said law. We ask that the law be upheld and investigated to the full extent of the justice systems capabilities.
