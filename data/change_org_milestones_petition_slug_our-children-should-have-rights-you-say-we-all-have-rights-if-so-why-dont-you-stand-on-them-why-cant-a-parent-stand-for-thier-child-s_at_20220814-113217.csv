<p>i wish i felt like it mattered what i do .. At this point after everything i know and all that it is ...though it seems lost... But everyday i fight anyways</p>
<p>. Judge took adjudication. But said we'll talk ab sandwich visits in december .had nothing but positive things to say and treated me as if i were somewhat human.. I stipulated the terms with adjustment to some words. ..and agreed to disagree it was as close to right as they wanted it to be.. </p>
<p>I am hopeful the positivity i see isn't some more corrupt bullshit.</p>
<p>... Been clean.. Job.. Work for room at motel.. Stable-ish. .... definitely better since it fell.. Worker finally trying to give resources i coulda been utilizing</p>

And they called me last week so I called the supervisor to find out what I'm supposed to do cuz my girls on leave he says "" this guy will be filling in for her we have to do this today are you available?"" ..."" of course here's my work address call me when you get here or we can schedule a time"" .... He replies "" what time does your girl usually do it?""... "" between 6 and 8 depends on what time I get done working"" ...he said "" ok ill give him the info expect him between 6 and 8. Ill have him call you now so you have his number"" ... Nothing for hours so i call back.. Get his number.. Calling ""i cant do it today. Ill be there sunday."" He declared.... And assured me its on him not me... So i call the supervisor back and make sure hes aware... Again assures me its on them not me... </p>
<p>Sunday comes no call/answer. No show.... On him</p>
<p>Monday morning he texts me. I said ""heres my work address CALL  me whe you get here because i could be in any room."" . .he says hell be btween 5:30 and 6.... At 4 he says ""im done early i can come now"" my irritated but polite response ""i wanna finish the job i am almost done"" he sas ""im at Chipotle text me when youre ready"" .....i text ""20 min room 411""</p>
<p>Im waiting..............wtf so i look at my phone.... </p>
<p>""Im here"" 2 min ago</p>
<p>""Im out i got other clients"" 1 min ago</p>
<p>No unusual cars outside</p>
<p>/#÷/×/\$\!/÷/+*€×€+*\×/÷\=*÷£×€×*×&amp;÷*÷£(excuse my language)</p>
<p>So i call the company ... Yay its after 5pm .. No answer</p>
<p>So i call my girl... He came right back</p>
<p>I pee he says there's no line i about snap!! ""IDF THINK SO I AINT DONE NO DAMN DRUGS GIVE ME ANOTHER CUP"" so he did... It was ALL NEGATIVE </p>
<p>I set the cups side by side and take picture. Send them to my girl. And call her. She says ""he better have put that as a negative!"" I state ""he did and being the last 2 cups i done with you the line stops half way and there is no line we both seen it now this y'all. Gotta fix your cups. How many sittin on false positives right now???"" Dude tried to argue a little about how they cant be faulty .... I laughed then gotta hell of an attitude ""I MANUFACTURED URINE ANALYSIS CUPS FOR INTEGRITY I WAS A MACHINE AND LINE OPERATOR I KNOW ALL ABOUT THESE CUPS AND THEY'RE DEFAULTS!!!"" you are required to wear gloves while handling the cups or any of its materials because; say if someone decides on lunch to go do a bump and touched they're dope to do so... Don't wear gloves .. Touches cup. ....contaminated... The only person who is at fault for it is the guy who has to piss in it</p>
