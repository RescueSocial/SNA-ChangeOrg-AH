Through his company\u00a0News Corp, he is the owner of hundreds of\u00a0local, national, and international publishing outlets\u00a0around the world, including\u00a0The Sun\u00a0and\u00a0The Times\u00a0in the UK,\u00a0The Daily Telegraph\u00a0and\u00a0The Australian\u00a0in Australia,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0and\u00a0The New York Post\u00a0in the US, book publisher\u00a0HarperCollins, and the television broadcasting channels\u00a0Sky News Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Fox News\u00a0(through the\u00a0Fox Corporation). He was also the owner of\u00a0Sky\u00a0(until 2018),\u00a021st Century Fox\u00a0(until 2019), and the now-defunct\u00a0News of the World</em>.</p>\n<p>In July 2011, Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the News of the World, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty, and public citizens. Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Many of Murdoch\u2019s papers and television channels have been accused of biased and misleading coverage to support his business interests.</p>\n<p>The sun has a long history of printing fake news, some of which has been so damaging and offensive it will never be forgotten, such as the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The sun ran a front page headline and blamed the fans for the Hillsborough tragedy, stupefying journalistic failure, it has become the public symbol of the lies at the heart of the cover-up. The editor still claims today that he was \"duped\" by corruption involving the sun, and a cover up to \"smear fans and protect the police\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn't that long ago that The Sun ran a story about how kind hearted Johnny Depp is as he visits children's hospitals regularly dressed as Captain Jack sparrow. It is clear and obvious, that they would do anything to sell a story, true or false as they would suddenly make these allegations against Johnny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So with such a corrupt, evil and disgrace of a tabloid and news empire, and with the evidence so high against them, how did Johnny lose? Well now the connections between the judge, his son, ex wife and Rupert Murdoch are beginning to come to light. Collision? The judges son working for Rupert Murdoch? This entire case has seemingly been the biggest scandel of our recent years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How is Rupert Murdoch not in prison? How is the judge not being investigated? So many questions. Only time will tell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For major companies such as Disney and Warner Bros to fall behind this lies and corruption one can only guess as to why \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's show them that we know the truth. We stand by Johnny.
