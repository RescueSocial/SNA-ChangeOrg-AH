Anthony was wrongfully accused of murdering two fast-food restaurant managers and served 28 years on death row in Alabama before his exoneration. He was played by O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. in the film \u201cJust Mercy.\u201d The film, starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx, follows attorney\u00a0Brian Stevenson\u00a0as he fights for the\u00a0wrongly imprisoned\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Hinton.</p>\n<p>Anthony\u2019s case parallels Julius\u2019 in so many ways. He was represented by an inexperienced, overwhelmed and underprepared public defender. He was convicted despite having a strong alibi (Hinton\u2019s boss says he was at work when the murders took place; Julius\u2019 parents say he was at home). In both cases, the state\u2019s charges rested largely on \u201cjunk\u201d forensic science that has since been disproven.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, they are similar in the ways that the system was designed to protect itself, even in the face of obvious errors. The problems with Anthony\u2019s case were so glaring that when he was finally granted a retrial by the U.S. Supreme Court, a new judge dismissed all charges and let him go free. For decades before that, however, the system ignored new evidence, swept contradictory testimony under the rug, and worked to cover its tracks \u2013 at the expense of Anthony\u2019s freedom.</p>\n<p>This Friday at 6 PM SCT, Anthony will join us <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/justice4juliusjones\" rel=\"nofollow\">on Facebook</a> to share his thoughts on Julius Jones and what he learned from his long fight for justice.

Today we have over 6 million signatures on Change.org supporting Julius.

And people all across the country \u2013 from Kim Kardashian-West to Russell Westbrook to everyday folks like you and me are talking about Julius Jones and what we can do to bring him home to his family.</p>\n<p>Those conversations are having an impact. We now believe Julius Jones WILL be given a commutation hearing later this year. Between now and then, we have a lot of work to do. In the coming weeks, we will be sending out updates with news on Julius and his case, \u201cFact vs. Fiction\u201d memos to set the record straight, and other content you can share and pass on to your friends and family.</p>\n<p>We are excited that our first such update is a piece of great news. Dallas Cowboys Quarterback Dak Prescott has weighed in with an emotional, heartfelt letter to Gov.

To that end, you all are in the unique position of being able to make a direct impact by addressing a specific miscarriage of justice.</em></p>\n<p><em>After reviewing the facts of the Julius Jones case, I firmly believe the wrong person is being punished for this terrible crime; furthermore, an evaluation of the process that led to Mr. Jones\u2019 conviction raises serious legal and ethical concerns. I implore you to right this wrong. Please don\u2019t let another innocent black man die from the systemic mistreatment that has plagued our nation for far too long.</em></p>\n<p><em>It is my firm belief that Julius Jones\u2019 conviction and death sentence is an egregious injustice. Mr. Jones has been on death row for 20 years, despite written affidavits from his trial lawyers describing the ways they failed him in court. Mr. Jones\u2019 attorneys never presented the photo taken 9 days prior to the crime that could have provided clarity about the shooter\u2019s description. They were appointed without having any experience in death penalty cases, and did not even present Mr. Jones\u2019 alibi at trial. In addition, a member of the jury (comprised of 11 white members out of 12) has confirmed that the jury acted with racial animus \u2013 admitting that inappropriate and biased statements were made by other jurors during the trial, including the use of racial slurs.</em></p>\n<p><em>The treatment of Julius Jones is the kind of miscarriage of justice African American men like myself live in fear of, and that is why I feel compelled to use the influence that God has blessed me with to speak up for what I believe is right and to give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves. Julius Jones\u2019 case is a clear example of what can happen to a person who cannot afford legal representation, and what can happen to a black person at any time in this country \u2013 which is exactly why so many are protesting for the changes we so desperately need. I ask for you to please do your part to help bring about this change by giving thoughtful and sincere consideration to your review of Julius Jones\u2019 commutation application. My prayer is that he is able to salvage what remains of his life and that, through the righting of a decades-old wrong, he will be restored to his family soon.</em></p>\n<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>\n<p><em>Rayne Dakota \u201cDak\u201d Prescott</em><br><em>Dallas Cowboys</em></p>", "photo": {"id": "224421022", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/9/ad/wb/ybaDwbSpmTeenYL-800x450-noPad.jpg?1597082985", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27366255", "createdAt": "2020-07-24T00:40:59.000Z", "signatureCount": 6000000}, {"__typename": "StarterPetitionUpdate", "id": "27288293", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T22:20:59.000Z", "title": "TONIGHT: Watch Julius Jones' Story on 20/20 (7pmCT/8pmET)", "description": "<p>Hi Everyone!</p>\n<p>Be sure to watch abc's 20/20 today for a special episode featuring the story of Julius Jones! 7pmCT/8pmET.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Cece</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>More Info:</p>\n<p>A SPECIAL EDITION OF \u201820/20\u2019 FEATURES FORMER HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL STATE CHAMPION AND STAR FOOTBALL PLAYER JULIUS JONES, WHO IS SEEKING CLEMENCY\u00a0WHILE ON DEATH ROW FOR MURDER\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2018The Last Defense: Julius Jones \u2013 A Special Edition of 20/20\u2019 Airs Tuesday,\u00a0</p>\n<p>July 14 (8:00 \u2013 10:00 p.m. EDT), on ABC</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 1999, authorities arrested 19-year-old former high school basketball state champion and star football player Julius Jones, days after a businessman in a predominantly white suburb of Oklahoma City was shot and killed.
