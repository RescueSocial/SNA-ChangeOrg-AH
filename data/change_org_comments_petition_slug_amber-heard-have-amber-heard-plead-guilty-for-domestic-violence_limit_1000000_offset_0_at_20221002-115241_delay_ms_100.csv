You ruined Depp's career and life and thought that you would be free of the consequences of your own actions as well. It's time to make things right. Be honest and plead guilt to the abusing of Depp. He was already punished, charged and looked down upon. You've had your justice, let Depp have his. </p>

It seems strange, but I don't want to choose sides when I clearly did not see the inside picture. Since Depp has been charged with abuse, why isn't Heard? I'm sure that some people would find disclosure and peace if at least both parties were punished. This leaves no one free from consequences and deemed the victim. For all we know they can both be each other's abuser. </p>
<p>If you, the reader, want to learn more about this issue of Heard vs Depp, I recommend reading legitimate articles and listen to audios and videos. Keep an open mind when forming an opinion. Both Heard and Depp are beloved people and actors and can both fog your conclusion because of who you think they are. </p>
<p>My personal opinion is that Depp is the victim. Heard has been manipulative and caught lying. But since Depp has already been charged and deemed as the abuser, at least have Heard charged, too. Again, we as the community have no idea what happened in both Depp's and Heard's private lives and can only create assumptions based on what we have been allowed to see or hear. If we cannot prove that Amber Heard was the main abuser to Johnny Depp, at least have Heard punished as well.</p>
<p>Amber, I recommend that you simply come clean and accept the charges against you for domestic abuse/violence instead of only blaming the opposing party. You abused Depp, and for all we know he could've abused you. Both of you may have abused each other. You ruined Depp's career and life and thought that you would be free of the consequences of your own actions as well. It's time to make things right. Be honest and plead guilt to the abusing of Depp. He was already punished, charged and looked down upon. You've had your justice, let Depp have his. </p>
