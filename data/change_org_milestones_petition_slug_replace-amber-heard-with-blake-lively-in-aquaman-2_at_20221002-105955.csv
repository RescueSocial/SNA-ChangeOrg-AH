<p>On the stand, Depp also answered a question about what it has been like for him to listen to Heard’s testimony during the trial.</p>
<p>“Insane,” he said, “It’s insane to hear heinous accusations of violence, sexual violence … that she’s accusing me of. (It’s) horrible, ridiculous, humiliating, ludicrous, painful, savage, unimaginably brutal, cruel.”</p>
<p>Depp added that “no human being is perfect” and once again denied the allegations.</p>
<p>“I have never in my life committed sexual battery, physical abuse, all these outlandish, outrageous stories of me committing these things,” he said. “And living with it for six years, and waiting to be able to bring the truth out.”</p>
<p>He said that “no matter what happens I did get here and I did tell the truth and I have spoken up for what I’ve been carrying on my back, reluctantly, for six years.”</p>
