StarterPetitionUpdate,28230390,2020-12-16T10:58:40.000Z,"Making progress on an agreement with the school, but still some way to go!","<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Thank you again for your support as we work to get this issue resolved. We really appreciate you using your voices to help us send a clear message to let the school's leadership know what the community would like as an outcome for Famous: to be back in school, learning with his peers, and allowed to wear a mask.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the school for being open to finding a resolution. They recently suggested several options which they felt would be a reasonable way to move forward. Below are the ways they suggested Famous could return wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Although we are happy that they are keen to find a solution, we still want to make sure it is a good solution, and feel that some improvements could be made on these options for him wearing a mask.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a guided tour once everyone has left for the day so he can see the environment for himself</li>
<li>Return to school and to have his own teaching space opposite the main Year 5 classroom. Famous would be collected at dinner time allowing him to eat at home and have his mask changed by an adult, ready for the afternoon session at 1pm.</li>
<li>Return to school and have his own teaching space opposite the main Year 5 classroom. At lunch time Famous would either eat in the hall with his friends (without a face mask), or eat in the classroom. If he felt uncomfortable playing outside, he would be able to cover his face with a scarf or remain inside the classroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to find a way for Famous to be able to be taught alongside his peers wearing his mask, as we are not sure why he needs to be in a separate classroom, and we would like some more clarity about whether he can wear a mask at break time instead of covering his face with a scarf.</p>
<p>We are hoping to meet with the school's governors following the official complaints procedure, and hope that this process may bring us closer to a good solution.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support!</p>",,,,
StarterPetitionUpdate,28197747,2020-12-10T12:42:14.000Z,Let’s take this campaign to the next level,"<p>Hi all, I just wanted to reach out to let you know we’ve just passed 43,512 signatures on our petition! Thank you so much for your amazing support! It is really important to Famous to know that people in his community support him in his choice to wear a mask, and your kind words of support mean a lot.</p>
<p>We've reached out to the school and the Diocese of Birmingham education department to ask for a meeting to resolve this issue.  </p>
<p>Previously, the school have suggested that Famous could return to school wearing his mask if he was taught in a classroom alone, and stayed separate from the other children and did not mix with them at break times.<br><br>While we appreciate the school's willingness to come to a compromise, we really hope that a better solution can be reached, and that Famous can be back in school alongside his peers with his mask.<br><br>We look forward to updating you with any further news and hope you are all staying safe and well.<br><br>Take care!</p>",,,,
