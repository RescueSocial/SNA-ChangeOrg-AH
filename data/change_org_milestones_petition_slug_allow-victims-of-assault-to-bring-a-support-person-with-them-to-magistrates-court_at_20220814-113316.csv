StarterPetitionUpdate,30398007,2022-04-01T13:32:36.000Z,,Response from Attorney-General,"<p>Thank you everyone for the support. I received a response from the Attorney-General this week, advising that support people can apply for an exemption to attend court through the Magistrates Court, which is fantastic. Unfortunately, this information is not being widely advertised, as it should be, which means victims of assault may not be aware this is an option. My hope is that this petition will force the government to make this option clearer on the Magistrates Court website.</p>",,,
