<p><strong>Speak to Reporters to Support Amber!<br><br>Ask Organizations to file an Amicus Curiae brief onto Amber Heard's Appeal to Support her</strong> - <em>On long-term social effects</em><br><br>We further need to report the online operations and in-person tampering, and currently working on that. </p>
<p>""Internet Journalists"" were used by both Waldman and Barresi. They learned from each other on how to harm Amber Heard.<br>Waldman admitted he had no previous clients involved with domestic violence. The longstanding tradition of harming women and victims with ""Fixers"" was increased during this to be both <a href=""https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">online</a> and in-person.</p>
<p>We showed earlier that we have evidence of online operations harming Amber with persuasive science that we gave to Reporters.</p>
<p>The online issues are in essence extortion and illegal intimidation, saying to her since the ""Amber Heard's 2020 Takeaway: <a href=""https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/Adapt%20and%20Survive%20Amber%20Heard%20-%20YouTube%20Video"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Adapt and Survive</a>"" video in 2020 where she won in that case then saw 43K bot texts 'not a victim' then tens of thousands more switching texts, that she must recant or be destroyed/killed for it.<br>We wanted CSOs to look into it months before the trial. During her trial, it was 3-10x worse in metrics than any other previous time. Supposedly, a juror went onto one of the social media sites afterwards.</p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lgNL2l9N45ZTb5wupeSiW6lbxhoVzSP/edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">In our report of the Judge</a>, we state:<br><em>""The misconduct, neglect, and suppression [by the Judge and Court] that increased danger led to thousands of death threats increasingly reaching Amber Heard and her witnesses during the trial as in testimony. </em></p>
<p><em>In-person, witnesses became threatened and tampered with before testifying on both sides of the trial. E.g., Jennifer Howell had her door drilled in and a witness of the Viper Room Richard Albertini was given death threats by a Hollywood Fixer... </em><em>[This witness is listed as the leading first source by Richard Schwartz as witnessing a cigarette put out on a woman similar to Amber's fears in the recording]</em></p>
<p><em>It is rational to conclude that jurors could have been afraid to provide a positive verdict for Amber Heard due to the dangers discussed during the trial that persist no matter the outcomes and lack of protections. Multiple attacks on the UK Judge from the 2020 verdict persisted after he stated that Amber Heard had been abused with a verdict helping her survival.</em><br><em>The jurors could have been hunted as were the witnesses and defendant. Although Amber Heard requested protections of the juror’s identities, it is clear that many attending in the court room could have identified the jurors.""<br></em></p>
<p>Although Empire Media Group has 12+ publications and 'new' not previously approved witnesses were brought into the end of the trial, this from her past friends, tracked by the Fixer and not referred to support Amber, only appeared in 1 site.</p>
<p>""Now working for an Austin-based security company, [Joshua] Cruz told Hollywood [Fixer] Paul Barresi: <a href=""https://radaronline.com/p/amber-heard-johnny-depp-trial-friends-dispute-borderline-personality-disorder/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">“Amber was always a sweet, considerate and lovely, little girl growing up and she's never changed. I've never known Amber to have ever caused a moment of sorrow for anyone.”</a> “Honestly, I don't believe she ever really knew, as we were growing up, how beautiful she was.” - Joshua Cruz, who has known Heard since childhood.</p>
<p>We have the <strong>email that Barresi sent Waldman on April 18</strong> to shut down Richard Albertini (first witness of Viper Room). There are <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/AmberHeardIT/status/1537412652464578562"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">3 cooperating witnesses so far (Video testimony)</a> to Barresi tampering, threatening, bribing, misleading, and possibly a 4th witness if cooperating. Albertini texted on May 19th (during the trial) that he would have testified for Amber's behalf.</p>
<p>2nd, Barresi emailed Elon Musk's lawyer on May 13 to remove this witness knowing of violence, crime, and tampering from social media, and disturbingly referred to murdered Amie Harwick who was referred to Barresi and Wayne Ketaily when she had cyber-stalking.<br>Neither Amber Heard's nor Amie Harwick's deaths after cyber-stalking are being stopped.<br><br><em>***Update:</em> We have Audio files from 2019 of Adam Waldman in negotiations with (originally Team Amber) witness Albertini and Albertini's lawyer of how to harm Amber Heard in the media by using Fixer Barresi, and of pay offs both for the media articles and after the trial. The payoffs after trial explains why Barresi and others became so bloodthirsty, intimidating, and tampering during Amber's trial.<br>Waldman states Depp is 'perfectly safe' with his Security. Sadly, this wasn't obtained by Amber's lawyers for the case.</p>
<p>Right now, many pages of Amber showing her good work are being deleted. It's heartbreaking and wrong. Criminal investigations should have been started a year ago, but were thwarted. It only increased in the intimidation and harms...<br><br><strong>The positive impact Amber has done for the world</strong> - we showed Reporters her <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20120118112943/http://amberheardofficial.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">AmberHeardOfficial.com</a> site showing her causes and activism which she deleted at the beginning of the relationship in 2012 - will always continue.</p>
<p>Remember that.<br><br><strong>We now have the in-person evidence, but as said as before, <em>it's crucial for you to support her</em> as Amber Heard has many insider threats around her.</strong><br><br><strong>Thank you to everyone who have returned to sign this petition.

It's unprofessional to charge victims.<br><br>Symbols of Disinformation Operations:<br>Sure, you can confuse victims/witnesses with symbols like 'devils, truth, prejudice, monsters, skeletons, dead flesh/dead hearts, hunting hounds, mermaids, coding/tech icons' and more which requires a CYBER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST to understand (and real ones, not with fake suits)...

Abuse of Process and telling a leader in AI Governance was as far as they went. They did not use Social Network Analysis evidence.

The more Waldman/Depp try to twist it against Amber with Campaign Bot Technology, the more obvious it is...</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Amber Heard is getting ready for Aquaman 2! ~ but also for the history books ~ </strong></em><strong>Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in this scene is supposed to be saying, ""I Cannot Stand By While Women's Lives Are Lost"" while saving Mera's life.</strong> </p>

<p>Maybe if you're a history buff, you can guess why it's double sided how Lobbyist Adam Waldman used <em>""Winston Churchill"" (the Prime Minister of Britain during World War II and against the Nazis)</em> when *someone* used it for symbolism as a quote for Robart Lio's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEAomcLuClCPT-HRB-KBu_w"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Aquaman Bots channel</a> that exposed how easy it is to create traffic bots to sign petitions (using different country IPs) and on a 2nd twitter account as 'Ralph White.'   <br><em>The quote is: ""You can always count on Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.""</em></p>
<p>This is especially true when it comes to cyber abuse online. Upon that, Amber Heard won in the United Kingdom which is ahead on coercive control laws to help women, 999, and safety tech. <em><strong>Cherie Blair (ex prime minister Tony Blair's wife) and Jennifer Robinson (Julian Assange's lawyer of 10 years. Waldman met with him 7 times before he was targeted on election interference and not long after we saw him detained) support Amber Heard.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Zack Synder had Mera use a British accent in his Justice League.</strong></em></p>
<p>No Hate Campaign - yes, we wish it was progressive to remove hate online that threatens lives and the progress that removed it elsewhere.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tens of Thousands of New Accounts</strong></em> (just the ones tweeting, not the ones just liking, either, because saw some of those messing up Natural Language Understanding) target Amber Heard in preliminary social network analysis from 2019-2021. It's over 35,000 new accounts. 134,000 tweets from new accounts made in the same year of 2020 targeting Amber in 2020. This doesn't include youtube or instagram, either.<br>Around 100 a day and peaks of 240 a day of new accounts were made in 2020 and show in targeted analysis around Amber. </p>
<p><strong><em>According to ""The Price of Influence: Disinformation in the Private Sector""</em></strong><br>They had a ""layered approach to propagating<br>material throughout social media. First, a group of older accounts<br>— referred to as “aged accounts” — that posted links to the articles<br>they had published in media sources was employed. Then, a new<br>batch of accounts that reposted content from the aforementioned<br>aged accounts to amplify the messages was used..."" <a href=""https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf</a><br>This is clearly seen in Amber's case.</p>
<p>What's worse, is the linked whistleblower at Facebook earlier - Sophie Zhang - shows that over 9,000 accounts were used in Azerbaijan to attack human rights activists, journalists, and '<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157720306386"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">rebels</a>.' She said they 'did it badly.' Yes, they did. These Social Campaign bots are far more difficult, voluminous, and skilled, to attack <strong><em>a single individual linked to human rights, women's rights, and the United Nations</em></strong>. <em>(The United Nations, of which Sir Churchill supported). 35,000 plus is far greater than that disinformation campaign that Zhang caused a Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Researcher to eventually investigate at FB.</em></p>

<p>Waldman bragged after he was Suspended from Twitter around April 20 that Depp had the ""fastest to 1 million followers in the HISTORY of Instagram."" If mentioned earlier, I swear I saw 'fake jack sparrow' as an example for content review agents training AI/ML signals back in 2019 (of course, always 1 year ahead of the elections). </p>
<p><em><strong>We see that Amber's case centers around Twitter as she's said. In fact, Twitter removed social sharing signals in 2015, a year before the 2016 elections.</strong></em> Webscraping Twitter showed that on election night, Trump was being named 4-5 times more than Hillary Clinton. But Social Bots have still not been linked to or reported on any of this.<br>Facebook still has social sharing signals showing, and the petitions are hardly shared there.</p>
<p>The large fake one attacking Amber Heard in Aquaman 2 has around 22,000 shared links on FB. The Cloud words for Twitter center around @Change.</p>
<p>The Social Network Analysis of over 940,000 tweets between 2019-2021 actually focuses on destroying Amber, not 'pro-depp' first in reality. </p>
<p>Waldman represented both organized crime accused Oligarch Oleg Deripaska and Christopher Steele's Dossier. By attacking and trying to destroy or kill Amber Heard, they're essentially making it obvious that this was double dealing. <br>Unfortunately, Depp is obsessed with Amber. If you notice, she's the ""most beautiful woman according to a scientific algorithm"" - I also know what that does with my own mother. The male ex partners never let go of these women. The more glamourous they imagine the woman they abuse to be, the worse it is for the abusive man's obsessions with her.</p>

<p>Among the death threats and social bots online - as tech is a part of this 21st Century story - Waldman refers to homeland security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.'</p>
<p>In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a ""007 Flemming's novel"" to an artificial intelligence auditor? </strong></p>
<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. They terrified dozens of actresses.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, intense real-time monitoring occurs for Amber Heard online using AI Bots which claim using ""I am"" Persona Dialogue - open source between 2017 and 2020 - to be 'victims' and use ILM/Alex fill in the blank based on previous text Dialogues which goes beyond a 2021 social network analysis paper using BERT: <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071</a></p>

<p>Witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed Depp's agents wanted to make lies about Amber Heard's trips to Tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.</p>
<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>The United Kingdom is where Amber won in the NGN trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.</strong></p>

<p>From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.</p>
<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore.</p>

Over 30,000 tweets/activities were on January 27th, days <em>before</em> the audio leaks beginning on January 31st in the Daily Mail newspaper and there were few targeted tweets before then in that month.

<li>Recently, we saw two AI Bot accounts threatening Amber Heard with a dead heart profile and raw flesh banner, and Hunting Hound working, then a faceless profile working to boost as well (layered persona bots). If you recall, the trials in 2020 revealed that Depp put raw meat around the house and in Amber's gown. How does a moderator-type person who is 'not a bystander' sleep? It's like a smoking gun that we used to ask a Twitter Worker - finally reached after all of this time - for help, who said our studies were forwarded.</li>

As a result, if the case moves to trial later this year, Depp will face counterclaims after his attorney told media outlets that Heard's tale of domestic abuse was a ""hoax.""...</p>
<p>Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was ""fake"" and all part of a ""sexual violence hoax,"" Heard included defamation counterclaims too...</p>
<p>Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims — a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit against a British tabloid. <strong>The November ruling that Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was ""substantially true""</strong> has wounded Depp's career...</p>
<p>The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.</p>
<p>But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the Daily Mail in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.)...</p>
<p>""In support of her accusation of malice, Ms. Heard alleged that the GQ journalist, Mr. Heath, stated that Mr. Depp invited him to interview the actor because he was 'angry —angry about a lot of things —and he's vengeful,'"" states the opinion. ""Moreover, Ms. Heard has alleged that Mr. Depp has the intention of ruining her career; citing statements that he made to friends demonstrating a malicious intent. Further, Mr. Depp has admitted his intent to destroy Ms. Heard's career by stating that he wanted her replaced on Aquaman. Accordingly, Ms. Heard has sufficiently pled a malicious intent, which prevents a ruling on the self-defense privilege at this stage in the litigation.""<br><br>From: <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax</a></p>

I remember being told that they had reached out to a nurse to do a concussion check. 16.

Amber and I were supposed to go bowling the night before, but Amber told me that she could not join because she had been in a bad fight with Johnny. I came over to the Eastern Building to apply makeup before her TV appearance, and as I walked into her kitchen, I saw writing on the countertop in gold marker.

<p><strong>Photos, audios, texts, witnesses, and data proved Amber Heard is a victim of domestic abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber is a spokesperson for the ACLU, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, World Identity Network, and United Nations Gender Equality SDG5.</strong></p>
<p>Heard continues to make frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence that were attempting to make their voices heard during that pivotal moment in US history. In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women’s rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically). Amber has continued with trips to Central America where she met with human-rights defenders, diplomats, and indigenous community leaders.</p>
<p><em>She has spoken for, introduced and advocated for democratic candidate Kamala Harris since 2007 and has been very active in supporting Harris in her 2020 presidential run</em>. Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as “revenge porn”) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.</p>
<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.</p>
<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and free-thought in the increasingly polarized political world at Arizona State University for thousands of people attending.</p>

<p><em>The Sun</em>: ""On November 2, following a four-week trial, a judge ruled that the allegations against Depp, 57, were<strong> “substantially true” and that he was violent towards Amber.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Domestic violence charities have hailed the outcome a victory</strong></em> that will hopefully encourage other victims to speak out and seek justice.</p>
<p>Karen Ingala Smith, CEO of domestic violence charity Nia, praised Amber’s courage, saying: <strong>“I would like to acknowledge the bravery of Heard in naming the abuse that she was subjected to.”</strong>""</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately, <strong>the online warfare to demean progress for women worldwide</strong> - people of my team know that female leaders in South America were removed because of online cyberabuse - continues.</em></p>
<p>Amber Heard may be in entertainment, but she's historically been highly political, highly an activist, and a humanitarian.</p>
<p>Contrary to former belief, the social technology companies are not liberal on the backend. Stereotypes abound against women and internationals in their training and actions, which is backed up by repeated people defying their NDA contracts. Pinterest's ex-COO recently won $22 million in a settlement about gender discrimination. The world is catching onto *environments* and *livability* online, as well as training, but meanwhile, we have to see people like Amber Heard struggle.</p>
<p>From real tests and studies, people will sign petitions, ""join in,"" and more <strong><em>even when they see bots signing</em></strong>. These leaders in tech do not go out and tell them that they're wrong. It's completely enabled, just like as part of the institutions Amber discussed in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Though Change.org shut down at least 4 abusive comment sections on petitions against Amber, deleted possibly two hate petitions, and the number of 253 in search related to her name has decreased to 241, <em>they still never put reCAPTCHA onto the large hate petition against her</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you can tell from the ratio of low amounts of comments, likes, and so on compared to 'signatures' that the petitions are usually increased to a set amount to gain attention via machine learning bot experts.</p>
<p>See this short video about the Bots Swarm the days just before Xmas! Happy 'holidays' or should I say, why should coders from reddit hate groups have more of a say than our own leaders?</p>
<p>By the way, it's online retaliation... Let's say maybe the internet differed during #MeToo. If it was different, though studies are as old as 2007, it's now fully controlled by 'men's rights' and other extremist groups. Anyone can hire them, but women in machine learning and AI is rare. In fact, it can just be 17% women in AI according to <a href=""https://action.consumerreports.org/coded_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">Coded Bias</a> documentary. </p>

<ul>
<li>In reality, anyone who rationalizes abuse against Amber Heard is statistically and scientifically wrong in thinking that they're not harming women's safety and progress by doing so. It's proven in *real life* such as the danger increasing in Turkey due to the rationalized domestic abuse against women that it harms equality.</li>

<p>The same lack of action is shown by ignoring stopping domestic abuse against women in America.</p>
<p><strong>Years into the relationship, <em>""I rose from my bed one day smelling smoke"" Amber referenced in January 2020 at the Los Angeles Women's March</em>, which likely refers to waking up to her blood on a pillow. </strong></p>
<p>There was also a post from Amber about controlling women's bodies from the ACLU, but the link referenced to hiding from shelter during wildfires from Senator Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>“I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” a British judge wrote, dismissing the actor’s libel case on Monday...</p>
<p>Johnny Depp on Monday lost his court case against a British newspaper that called him a “wife beater” and claimed <strong>there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard repeatedly during their marriage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair</strong>, <a href=""https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case</a>, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was <strong>“substantially true.”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.</strong></em></p>
<p>The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said.</p>
<p>Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...</p>
<p>The article [from NGN] called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book.</p>
<p>The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....</p>
<p>After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, <em><strong>“Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, said the actress was “unable to comment on the case due to the ongoing U.S. proceedings.” But Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Ms. Heard’s American lawyer, said in a statement that <strong>the judgment was “not a surprise.”</strong></p>
<p>“We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s right to free speech,” Ms. Bredehoft said.""</p>
<p><strong>From <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/02/how-amber-heard-stood-alone-against-a-hollywood-superstar-johnny-depp"" rel=""nofollow"">The Guardian</a>: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Unlike him, however, she was given a police escort because of threats from Depp’s fans...</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 12 out of the 14 incidents of assault reported by Heard in open court, the judge said he found the allegations proved on the balance of probabilities...</strong></p>
<p>More seriously – say sources close to Heard – both she and her sister Whitney have received anonymous death threats. Harassing messages were also sent to the chambers of Jennifer Robinson, the human rights lawyer whose clients include Julian Assange and who attended court with Heard, alongside Heard’s partner, Bianca Butti, and a US attorney, Elaine Bredehoft.</p>
<p>Other voices, while not aligned specifically with Heard, had spoken up outside of court, such as the Labour frontbench MP Jess Phillips, who voiced concern about what she had read in coverage “that seems to be a character assassination of Heard, leaning too far, in my opinion, towards the old tropes about domestic abuse that campaigners like me have tried for years to combat...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>This is a great day for Amber!! We're so happy to cheer for you from the sidelines!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>We hope to support Amber Heard possibly at her May 2021 Virginia, USA Trial!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Despite online discrimination and manipulation, it's essential that jurors see support of Amber instead of only hate mobs.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The online and technology sphere has not been equal and has been altered... </strong></p>
<p><strong>It's horrible to watch her as domestic abuse victim be legally validated and the attacks to continue online...</strong></p>
<p>We've seen probable insider people online such as ""Cle"" describing the over a dozen incidents of violence when no one else reported on it... as well as $100,000 given to a 'witness' for Depp... before they were suspended on Twitter...</p>
<p><em>As proven, the main social media platforms prefer to stay with the hierarchy, of well, ""FAKE jack sparrow"" case examples, such as at BC Forward AT Facebook... Content protections could be automated with victim-centering, not discriminatory, supporting women's quality of life, and have humanitarian volunteers... </em></p>
<p><strong>It's so sad that they enable harming women's lives online and stopping their leadership...</strong></p>
<p><em>It's tragically created online, but it doesn't have to be...</em></p>
<p><strong>We're so happy to support Amber Heard!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will continue to help her life and others lives, too!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We hope that some see Amber's side</strong><em><strong>, </strong></em><strong><a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">because we should be doing more to improve and save lives</a></strong> <em>...</em></p>
<p><em>We actually work on public safety tech and safety tech projects in alliances, though not connected directly to this. When that anonymous source contacted online and then someone also continued to post with a different 'voice', it was during an internship planning about updating 911 and rescue systems with artificial intelligence, internet of things, real-time data, maps, machine learning and more, plus, also creating social media platforms... </em></p>
<p><em>Situations of having no witnesses was taken into account... </em></p>
<p><em>When it will ever be updated, is unknown... But we are helping other public safety tech partners.</em></p>
<p><strong>It's clear about technology and culture influencing this case. It's complex and won't be over unless society changes.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Not providing victims or the public with protective technology or data is about power... </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>As said, Amber was ahead of her time collecting data, especially as a woman when today, usually it's male dominated in technology, which shows also why we don't have technology for safety. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Many forces want to silence her activism.</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, the petitions on Change often have to be sponsored in order to be seen. Also... we gladly delete negative comments on this website where there is no reporting against enabling abuse against women. Defense is in our logo...</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p><strong>It's a Social Problem of Society</strong>. Blaming the woman for being murdered is exactly what we saw happening with the tabloids framing the audios against Amber Heard, and how they would literally cut out pieces that would have benefited her such as escalating to a ""crime scene"" and one of them being killed (would have been Amber losing her life), and her being kicked, kicked, kicked...</p>
<p>Blaming the woman for losing their life by the media (now social media too) is stated in 2013 dissertation sent to me.</p>
<p>""Intended to blame both partners equally for the violence, even when one had killed the other"" - We need to change this with social media. Social media can regulate news stories, also, yet, today's social media (not mentioned in the 2013 dissertation sent to me about domestic violence portrayed in the news media) is even worse, as it's 24/7 abuse. They don't even talk about 1 in 3 women being a victim of domestic violence. They'll focus on sexual assault, but not DV...</p>
<p>The tabloids (with social media) has been falsely framing and rationalizing escalations to a crime scene and Amber fearing for her life with social media amplifying hate 24/7.</p>
<p><em>""Domestic violence is also one of the leading causes of injury to women in the United States, with more than <strong>one in three women</strong> being a victim of domestic violence within their lifetime (National Criminal Justice Reference Service 2012).""</em></p>
<p>Are we ever going to empower and let people help by creating better systems?</p>

<p>After Amber WON and validated by the judge, they've increased sign ups, which is nonsensical without media and legality being on her side.

Women's Equality is political online, with figures like Melinda Gates getting 900+ dislikes to Hide From Search &amp; Hide from Recommendations with only 6K views.</p>

<p>Read the article: <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives</strong></a></p>
<p>The 911 calls made for her, audios, recordings, and videos collected have been framed on the internet without any consideration of her life or the millions of other women worldwide who have no way to collect evidence. <em>It’s preventing awareness and change to save lives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard may be Mera in Aquaman, but she is not bulletproof to the escalating repetitive, digitalized, and long-term harms against her.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What people don’t know is that Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.</strong> <a href=""https://savemenowapp.es/en"" rel=""nofollow"">911 cannot even locate with data</a> to know where a caller is or use text information.</p>
<p>She did this before the European Innovation Council and Swedish government supported creating <a href=""https://brightact.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">a cell phone application</a> that was founded during COVID-19 to streamline services, reporting, and data-collecting for domestic abuse victims.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amber-heard-united-nations-sexual-violence-event_n_5d8d58c5e4b0019647a5ebef"" rel=""nofollow"">United Nations General Assembly</a> just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://powerphone.com/landmark-decision-will-change-911-domestic-violence-call-handling/"" rel=""nofollow"">Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced for 911 dispatchers</a> in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it.</strong> There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA. Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.</p>
<p>When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You <a href=""http://accessos.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location</a> from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.</p>
<p><strong>By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.</strong></p>
<p>When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Washington Post</a> in December 2018.</p>
<p>There’s a lawyer for her ex that writes threateningly online with cryptic words such as “in memorium” and a dark profile photo with no oversight telling him to stop his actions.</p>
<p><strong><em>There are double standards of no mercy towards Amber, who wanted positive change and to do humanitarian work.</em></strong></p>
<p>Most women will never make backups of their texts, or store years of photos and recordings, not until culture has changed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.</strong></em></p>
<p>The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with her ex-husband, losing confidence, and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>It’s reported that staff knew she was injured, including kicked on a private plane and seen on a private island being physically harmed after a fight. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said she would be killed off record, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.</strong></p>
<p>Multiple YouTube accounts and a hateful petition against her crowdfund donations and advertising dollars with objectifying comments based off inciting the already existing, and increasing for the past ten years, hate against women, against LGBT equality, and especially agendas against female public figures and their leadership. It’s <a href=""https://www.stophateforprofit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hate for Profit</a> - which created a boycott campaign this year against social media platforms doing nothing to stop it, yet the United States movement of 1,100 businesses, nonprofits, and civil rights groups did not mention hate against women or LGBT.</p>
<p>Organizations such as <a href=""https://hatelab.net/2020/05/04/hatelab-featured-in-the-guardian/"" rel=""nofollow"">HateLab</a>, <a href=""https://www.adl.org/blog/redirect-method-yields-valuable-insights-for-countering-online-extremism"" rel=""nofollow"">MoonshotCVE</a>, <a href=""http://stophateuk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">StopHateUK</a>, <a href=""https://www.ditchthelabel.org/report/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ditch the Label</a>, <a href=""https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map"" rel=""nofollow"">Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)</a>, <a href=""https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/cyber-violence-report-press-release"" rel=""nofollow"">United Nations Women</a>, <a href=""https://www.genderit.org/sites/default/files/flow_corporate_policies_formatted_final_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Association for Progressive Communications</a>, <a href=""https://www.adl.org/trollsharassment"" rel=""nofollow"">Anti-Defamation League</a>, and <a href=""https://plan-international.org/news/2020-10-05-abuse-and-harassment-driving-girls-facebook-instagram-and-twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">Plan International</a> have studies about extremism, hate, discrimination, and hostility increasing on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Tens of thousands of victims are in these studies with no actions done by power-holders to do prevention.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/misogyny-sites"" rel=""nofollow"">SPLC marked in 2012</a> that Men’s Rights Reddit was a hate group and that American female public figures were especially targeted.<em> The group still exists and boosted the hateful petition against Amber Heard. </em><strong>Terms online such as ‘simp’ are used to harass supporters of Amber and other men trying to help her which is connected to these anti-women ideologies.</strong> “Fathers for Justice” posted a billboard outside her UK trial while people harassed her, proving once again that extremism from the internet will filter into in-person threats.</p>
<p><em><strong>The social media platforms ignore violence against women online and prevent reporting harassment to help others.</strong></em> Requiring victims to report themselves is too overwhelming and doesn’t protect people, not only counting the biased content review training. Only 17% of leadership at social tech companies may be women, and coding is not being used to help them or victims. AI for Good and the United Nations state that data is trained to be gender biased.</p>
<p><strong>Amber supported SDG5 for gender equality at the UN Social Good Summit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When technology could be used to rescue, empower, or to help women, it’s instead being used to wield power over them.</strong></p>
<p><em>Numerous accounts supporting Amber Heard online have been suspended, deleted, harassed, and removed from the internet and even hacked</em>, such as AmberHeard Italia page, MelanieMakeup, and witnesses. Petitions, videos, or posts supporting her are hardly seen and are suppressed online since they are not encouraged by social tech companies, their algorithms are manipulated by negative repetition, and they are not sponsored, despite hard news journalists or documentarians seeing them.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 era increased harassment, cyberabuse against women and domestic violence with no way for them to receive any help from other people, situational support, economic aid, and certainly not from modern technology. Crowdsourced help doesn’t exist for domestic abuse victims in the USA. It shows how dire the situation is.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard collected more evidence than most women ever will, and she did it in a society that tells women to be helpless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to take actions against cyberabuse and to help people with technology.</strong></p>
<p>Help crowdsourcing, crowdsourced housing and services, proactive protections against harms online, and updating public safety systems based on technology for good are the solutions we need. We need to move not only to being victim-centered, but to being proactive to help others whether online or in-person.</p>
<p>We need to tell people to help others and that leadership based on creating positive social impact which can inspire others is wanted – not retaliated against.</p>
<p><em><strong>We’re inspired to continue to work on <a href=""http://savemenowapp.es/"" rel=""nofollow"">changes to public safety</a></strong>. </em></p>
<p>We need to open our eyes to the problems of and solutions to our culture.</p>
<p><strong>We should embrace leaders and inspiring people such as Amber Heard!</strong></p>
<p><strong>More people should be supporting her and letting her be heard. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to do more to improve and save lives.</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this week, Andrew Rossow, Senior Legal Editor at True Hollywood Talk and founder of the anti-cyberbullying movement, <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/345858"" rel=""nofollow"">#CYBERBYTE</a>, announced the launch of a Kickstarter in partnership with 13 Reasons Why and Supernatural actor, Mark Pellegrino, to help fund <a href=""https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Mark-Pellegrino-and-Internet-Attorney-Andrew-Rossow-Announce-THE-GUARDIAN-PROJECT-Reality-Docuseries-20201027"" rel=""nofollow"">The Guardian Project</a> – a multi-tiered attack on bullying which they hope to bring to the big screen as a docuseries.</p>
<p>In an interview with<a href=""https://www.influencive.com/Andrew-Rossow-Bullying-Activism-Pellegrino"" rel=""nofollow""> Influencive</a>, Pellegrino and Rossow shed some light on the future of The Guardian Project. The project, according to Pellegrino, “enables victims to confront victimizers and obtain some form of justice. Whether that justice is restitution in the form of material payback for the harm caused by spreading false narratives, or the reform of the victimizers, we seek to empower victims of social media slander, libel, and bullying by letting the victimizers know that anonymity will not protect them from the consequences of their actions.”</p>
<p>The problem, Rossow says, is that our own regulators don’t want to believe this is a real problem. “Forty-eight states have some form of electronic harassment law, but the criminal provisions aren’t strong enough to do anything, other than slap on the wrist. This needs to change.”</p>

<p>Harassment is done by Depp's agents, paid tabloids, and online simulations.</p>
<p>Forces work against her, such as Adam Waldman who worked for Russian Oligarch Deripaska, to use social media against her while threatening reporters such as a New York Times one on 'national security', supporters, businesses like Warner Bros and L'Oreal, and witnesses.</p>
<p>Adam Waldman's Twitter account only follows the Dali Llama, and originally had no photo, then added a photo closer to the July 2020 UK NGN trial.</p>
<p>Swayed by false commentary and online tip jars, even reporter Nick Wallis removed evidence on Amber's side, such as <a href=""https://youtu.be/CunBOnfsDBE"" rel=""nofollow"">the recording included (13:33) of Divenere</a> telling Amber she was intimidated by Waldman with being deposed, $20,000 in lawyer fees, and leading questions to coerce her.</p>
<p>Messages are included from an anonymous source stating she was a partner of ex-staff in March 29 and April 2019, stating that Waldman and Depp's team wanted her done.</p>

Nor does she need to worry about Depp's circle, criminals including 3-time felony 'minion' Ryan Leone who will do anything for Depp's attention or to incite his followers, or high profile individuals.

<li>Amber Heard did what she should have to protect herself with collecting evidence, especially with the numerous death threats that her ex gave her, and is still giving to her de facto through his followers or by coercing her through his media manipulation.</li>
<li>She did this before culture (or public affairs) caught up.</li>
<li>SaveMeNow App is linked as the 'equal and safe technology' we support because, as the 911 calls were sensationalized, it shows that 911 isn't even connected to real-time data, location, text, or applications.

<li>We won't ever 'rationalize' abuse or deaths of women.</li>

<p><strong>We hope that her innocence is revealed soon via a verdict, and it's wrong to continually draw out these cases to make Amber suffer - it's politically and socioculturally orientated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Depp was recorded admitting to <a href=""https://youtu.be/zMAYCFPu-XQ"" rel=""nofollow"">headbutting her during that physical fight</a> that left her unconscious, nearly suffocated by being pushed into a pillow, and waking up to see her blood on her pillow.

<p><strong>For many months this 2020, Adam Waldman has used a strange account on Twitter that originally had no profile photo or banner, with it attacking a New York Times reporter, referring to her as a ""national security"" reporter among other reporters who write anything beneficial to Amber Heard or even when they write without bias. </strong></p>

<p>Parts of the Counterclaim from Amber Heard against Cyberabuse refers specifically to Adam R. Waldman, licensed by the Washington DC bar and who previously worked for Oligarch Billionaire Deripaska, who was accused of organized crime and knowing about election interference.</p>
<p><strong>Counterclaim in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virgina: CL-2019-0002911 from Amber Laura Heard against John C. Depp II.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/473092071/cl-2019-2911-def-counterclaims-8-10-2020"" rel=""nofollow"">Counterclaim CL-2019-0002911</a>: </strong></p>
<p>""1.                  As part of his ongoing smear campaign, Mr. Depp and/or his agents acting on his behalf have directed both authentic and inauthentic social media accounts, and/or non-human controlled “bots,” to target Ms. Heard’s Twitter account and attempt to interfere with her contracts and/or business expectancies. In particular, many of these accounts both smear and harass Ms. Heard while simultaneously promoting and praising Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, Adam Waldman. The talking points in these accounts are strikingly similar but use slightly different text and content to evade Twitter’s anti-spam and platform manipulation guideline, which bars harassing, abusive, and intimidating behavior except “when viewed in the context of a larger conversation.” A herd mentality helps mask predatory behavior.<br>2.                  There are a number of newly created foreign language accounts specifically or predominantly designed to damage Ms. Heard. Many of these accounts have Cyrillic signatures, reflecting Russian origin. Mr. Waldman, Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, is publicly  associated with Russian individuals with the capability to organize such attacks.</p>
<p>3.                  Two accounts, IFOD NET and MY GRINDELWALD, are responsible for approximately 50% of the targeted attacks on Ms. Heard. The MYGRINDELWALD account uses its platform to amplify anti-Heard hashtags and false information being disseminated about Ms. Heard. It has also amplified the change.org petitions described above, repeating calls for  Ms. Heard to lose contracts or business expectancies. And, as evidence of its origin, it routinely tweets the statements of Mr. Depp’s agent and attorney, Mr. Waldman, on a near-daily basis and often praises the otherwise unknown attorney, even going so far as to say “i love you waldman!!”</p>
<p>4.                  In total, there are at least dozens if not hundreds of inauthentic accounts that impugn Ms. Heard while praising Mr. Waldman. This messaging further evidences the origin of Mr. Depp’s unlawful campaign and demonstrates that these inauthentic accounts are actively coordinating content to manipulate the Twitter platform and avoid detection....</p>
<p>1.                   Mr. Depp, through his agents and attorneys in Virginia, including specifically Waldman, have engaged in a campaign to harass and damages Ms. Heard through the use of computers and computer accessible vehicles.</p>
<p> 1.                  This campaign of harassment is consistent with comments Mr. Depp made to friends regarding his intentions to ruin Ms. Heard’s career, or worse. For example, in 2013, Mr. Depp texted his friend, actor Paul Bettany, the following: “Let’s burn Amber.” The same day, he texted Bettany again with plans to murder her: “Let’s drown her before we bum  her!!! I will f-k her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.”</p>
<p>1.                  This conduct also has the potential effect of polluting  the jury  pool  who will decide the actual issues in dispute in this lawsuit.</p>
<p>2.                  Mr. Depp, through his agents and attorneys, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CunBOnfsDBE"" rel=""nofollow"">has also attempted to intimidate and threaten witnesses</a> to attempt to influence their testimony in a manner adverse to Ms. Heard, claiming that they will have to spend significant sums for attorneys if they do not cooperate and sign declarations prepared by Waldman, suggesting that without their cooperation people will be arrested and charged with crimes, and the like....</p>
<p>1.                  Depp’s defamation and harassment of Ms. Heard did not stop when he filed this lawsuit. In fact, it has continued though the present, as Depp has authorized and  conspired  with his attorney, Adam Waldman (acting on Depp’s behalf), to attempt to destroy and defame Ms. Heard in the press, accusing her of being a serial liar who created the abuse she endured from Depp, which is not true.</p>
<p>2.                  On April 12, 2019, Depp, through Waldman, accused Ms. Heard of committing “defamation, perjury and filing and receiving a fraudulent temporary restraining  order demand with the court” falsely accusing Ms. Heard of not being attacked by Depp. Exhibit B.</p>
<p>3.                   Depp, through Waldman, continued to defame Ms. Heard in June 2019, stating to Blast that “Ms. Heard continues to defraud her abused hoax victim Mr. Depp, the #metoo movement she masquerades as the leader of, and other real abuse victims worldwide.” Exhibit C.</p>
<p>1.                  On July 2, 2019, Depp, through Waldman, told Blast that Ms. Heard, “went to court with painted on ‘bruises’ to obtain a Temporary Restraining Order on May 27.” Exhibit D. The next day, Waldman continued Depp’s defamation of Ms. Heard when he stated to People magazine that “Ms. Heard’s ‘battered face’ was a hoax.” Exhibit E.</p>
<p>2.                  Depp, through Waldman, continued to claim that Ms. Heard was committing perjury to the Daily Mail, when he stated on April 8, 2020 that “Amber Heard and her friends in the media use fake sexual violence allegations as both a sword and shield, depending on their needs. They have selected some of her sexual violence hoax ‘facts’ as the sword, inflicting  them on the public and Mr. Depp.” Exhibit F.</p>
<p>3.                  Then on April 27, 2020, Depp, through Waldman, again told the Daily Mail that “Quite simply this was an ambush, a hoax. They set Mr. Depp up by calling the cops but the first attempt didn’t do the trick. The officers came to the penthouses, thoroughly searched and interviewed, and left after seeing no damage to face or property.  So Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911.” Exhibit G.</p>
<p>4.                  On June, 24, 2020, Depp, through Waldman, falsely accused Ms. Heard in the Daily Mail of committing an “abuse hoax” against Depp. Exhibit H.</p>
<p>5.                  On July 22, 2020, Depp, through Waldman, tweeted the following with a picture:</p>
<p>This photo was taken March 23, 2013 ONE DAY AFTER Ms. Heard alleges Johnny Depp backhanded her in the face with heavy rings on his fingers.</p>
<p>6.                   On July 26, 2020, Depp, through Waldman tweeted the following with the same pictures:</p>
<p>Nice Photo taken March 24, 2013 one day after she [Ms. Heard] claimed Johnny smashed her in the face with heavily ringed fingers. Confronted, Amber testified she sees swelling in the pie. Whitney then testified she sees swelling and a SPLIT LIP. Do you Believe[sic] them or your own lying eyes?</p>
<p>1.                  These tweets contained false and defamatory information, including the date of the picture.</p>
<p>2.                  This elaborate plan to defame Ms. Heard was willful and malicious.</p>
<p>3.                  Contrary to his allegations and efforts to rewrite history, Depp did in fact engage in acts of domestic violence and abuse against Ms. Heard, and Ms. Heard did not perjure herself, fabricate evidence, defraud, or create a hoax. Depp’s statements and allegations, both  through Depp and his agent Waldman (acting on Depp’s behalf), are false and defamatory.</p>
<p>4.                  In this Counterclaim, Ms. Heard seeks a judicial declaration that her op-ed is not actionable, is protected by Virginia’s Anti-SLAPP statute, Virginia Code § 8.01-233.2, and Ms. Heard is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to Virginia Code § 8.01-233.2.</p>
<p>5.                  Ms. Heard further seeks to restore the balance of truth and fight back, as the victim of domestic abuse and violence, and take a stand against this continuing and unrelenting  abuse. Ms. Heard seeks compensatory damages and punitive damages from Depp for his false and defamatory statements and for the harassment and abuse of computers and computer accessed media, as set forth in this Counterclaim.""</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/cyrillic-russian-spiders-from-mars/"" rel=""nofollow"">According to reporter Joey Davis</a>:<br>On Adam Waldman's previous client, Oleg Deripaska:<br>""If you’ve read the five volumes of the US Senate’s investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election, you know the name. If not, he just may be the richest man you’ve never heard of. With an estimated worth of $6.2 billion, <strong>Oleg Deripaska is a Russian billionaire and Kremlin insider.</strong> In a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2017, he was described as one of “2-3 oligarchs Vladmi Putin turns to on a regular basis.” <strong>He’s been denied U.S visas for his suspected connections to Russian organized crime</strong>...</p>
<p> In reaction to the charges by Heard and her legal team, Waldman tweeted, “Ms Heard’s Counterclaim are the allegations of fake petitions and non-human bots and trolls and some kind of dastardly Cyrillic Russian involvement!! And the spiders from Mars…""</p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1301170034023292929"" rel=""nofollow"">The Hollywood Reporter Senior Editor Eriq Gardner September 2</a>:  ""Amazing that this lawyer in the midst of a defamation fight tweets out something false about me even after being told it’s false. What’s more, stunning that he can’t help himself even as he’s apparently about to fight having to give a deposition about social media activity. ""</p>
<p>""... against Adam R. Waldman, Esquire.<br>You state that Mr. Waldman is “. . . inciting online social media against people . . .” and “. . . harming the legal trials . . .” on Twitter involving his client, Johnny Depp’s case before Fairfax County Circuit Court. You state that Mr. Waldman’s tweets amount to witness intimidation and coercion, and that this behavior is also damaging to the public and reporters. You also state that the judge presiding over the case appears to discourage this behavior.<br>We decline to open a formal investigation of this matter, as this is a pending case and the parties may address this issue with the court. If the Court finds that Mr. Waldman has engaged in impropriety, such as violating a gag order, or if the Court holds Mr. Waldman in contempt of court, you may write to us again...""</p>
<p><strong>Notice how Amber Heard can describe very dangerous, visually horrible acts of violence against her, including strangling, burning threats, intimidation, and bruised ribs, and Depp has revealed in the audio leaks that he says Amber ""cannot deck him.""</strong></p>
<p>Online perceptions were attempted to be altered by referring to Amber truthfully stating she was 115 lbs and that any fight would not be fair. Evidence that would be supporting Amber Heard is twisted by these accounts online. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/cyrillic-russian-spiders-from-mars/"" rel=""nofollow"">According to Joey Davis and The Geek Buzz, who as been following this case for one and a half years</a>: ""In January 2018, Twitter disclosed its security personnel assess that over 50,000 automated accounts linked to Russia were tweeting election-related content during the U.S. presidential campaign...</p>
<p>The types of AI used to power these bots, and the mentality of paid and hobbyist trolls who purposely spread disinformation, isn’t always reserved for elections, but it’s always political. Case, or cases, in point: Trolls and bots that auto-post negative reviews en masse of games, movies, and TV shows that usually feature women and people of color in empowered roles. When Larry Johnson of Entrepreneur Magazine wrote about this in December of 2019, he was already late to the game because Captain Marvel (here and here), Starwars, Batwoman, and others had already fallen victim to the practice...""</p>
<p><strong>Notice how tabloids and media will insert a single claim against Amber, which the enabling culture and institutions that Amber described, will use to claim her detailed descriptions and data are not valid... Yet, the violence and abuse against Amber Heard is clearly documented and heinous. </strong></p>
<p><strong>One example even describes raw meat left around the house, when that supposed previous partner of ex-staffer from last year wrote that Depp is fascinated with serial killers...</strong></p>
<p>""...Today, NGN’s lawyer Sasha Wass QC asked Heard, 34, about the incident in Australia in March 2015, when Ms Heard alleges Mr Depp was taking MDMA and drinking heavily....</p>
<p>Ms Wass asked Ms Heard about the evidence of Ben King, Mr Depp’s previous estate manager, on the damage to the house in which they were staying – which included broken windows, graffiti on mirrors and blood and paint on the walls and floors....</p>
<p>She added: ‘He had burned holes through some cushions and through some lampshades, blood and paint, more messages on cushions, there was a couch flipped over. ‘It appeared to be he had set fire to one of the cushions because the carpet was burned around it a little.</p>
<p>‘My paints were out, it appeared to be that maybe he had either thrown or dropped paint on the floor and on the wall. More messages in paint and blood, I could see both textures.</p>
<p>‘I found raw meat, at first I didn’t know what it was, on the floor. Not just on the floor, I continued to find it… that day, hidden in various places.</p>
<p>‘He had taken my nightgown and ripped it into shreds. He wrapped pieces of food (in it).’</p>
<p>Ms Heard said there was a ‘significant pooling of blood on the floor, on the steps leading to the stairs. I could see my own bloody footprints (from the night before) but I could also see what appeared to be dropped blood’. She said: ‘I assumed it was from my own arms and hands and feet.’</p>
<p>Ms Heard continued that, when she got downstairs, Mr Depp was playing ‘death metal, blasting really loud’ and she could see ‘tonnes of broken glass’.</p>
<p>Ms Heard added: ‘There were windows broken, there was so much glass on the floor I could barely find a pathway to walk. There was damage left in the house in March 2015 (Picture: PA/PA Wire) ‘The ping pong table was broken and on the ground.’</p>
<p>... Ms Heard replied: ‘Yes, about 24 hours into his binge, rage, I had previously come downstairs… I knew he just needed to eat or sleep and the moment I described yesterday, where he offered the bottle to me, this is after he had held me up against the fridge by my neck.</p>
<p>‘He was screaming at me for ruining his life, he said over and over again that I ruined his f***ing life and that he wished he had never met me and that I did this… I made him this mad, I made him drink, I did this and I always did this.</p>
<p>‘He held a bottle up against my face, he told me that he would slice up my face.</p>
<p>‘I accept at some point I either pushed him or pushed his arms off me...</p>
<p>‘It was after that moment or after those moments, he was so angry he punched the wall… he started hitting the wall, he was punching the wall and he got carried away in that moment.</p>
<p>‘He saw the phone… it was kind of a mint green, cream Bakelite, plastic mounted phone on the wall and he picks it up and the hand that had been on my neck loosened a little bit as he was focused on the phone and I stepped back… while he proceeded to, instead of punching with his hand, his fist, he used the phone.’</p>
<p>Ms Heard told the court that Mr Depp smashed the phone ‘repeatedly, over and over again, into the wall, screaming at the top of his lungs and I watched as this phone just was disappearing in front of my own eyes’. She said that when Mr Depp was smashing the phone against the wall ‘it was breaking off in shards’.</p>
<p>Then look again in the article and notice how pieces are inserted.

<p><strong>Solutions and Updates: </strong></p>
<p>We submitted online reports and emails to organizations about the hate crimes against Amber Heard, (in the UK, hate crimes can be before it is violent, such as verbal, written, online, and abusive) including how it escalated outside the UK trial, to <a href=""https://www.stophateuk.org/report-hate-crime/"" rel=""nofollow"">Stop Hate UK</a>, which said they'll periodically monitor it online, but without permission from the victim (we do not talk to Amber Heard), couldn't report it further.</p>
<p>We're actually involved with advocating and <strong>trying to start public safety technology that is victim-centered to save lives</strong> for almost 2 years now. Amber Heard's case demonstrates enabling culture, witness issues, and how data needs to be collected. People should be evaluating how even with data, United Nations support, and positive leadership, how culture is pushed against Amber Heard. </p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.equalitycantwait.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Equality Can't Wait</a>, it will take 208 years before women are equal in the United States. The online institutions are not helping, and actually are pushing it backwards with hateful enabling and discrimination.</p>
<p>Could you imagine going through such violence and abuse, then all of these institutions, false accounts, tabloid media, and more try to ruin your leadership, self-sufficiency, or any progress?</p>
<p><strong>Even with domestic abuse being the most commonly experienced incident, when a public figure such as Amber Heard comes forward to lead against it with influence, it's then a battle to try to keep awareness, as power works to try to silence and stop their advocacy.</strong></p>
<p><em> Many Women's places have closed during COVID-19, when domestic abuse and cyberabuse is increasing, and there is <a href=""https://www.safehavencommunity.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">no crowdsourced help or housing</a> in the United States. </em></p>

<p><strong>We say that people should use technology to stop violence against women - Amber Heard data collected evidence.</strong></p>
<p>Upon the above about financial, legal, or publicity resources referenced, is that Amber Heard <em><strong>data collected</strong></em> her injuries, the abuse, and situations with texts, videos, and audios.</p>
<p><strong>If she did not collect this Data, likely, Amber Heard could have never become a Leader on Gender Equality or speak out against her abuse with evidence in spite of any intimidation of witnesses or unhelpful bystanders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>She did the right thing by coming forward and knowing that her abusive situations were wrong in order to keep evidence.</strong></p>
<p>You can have money for lawyers or be a public figure, but without evidence as referred to in the proposal that passed <a href=""http://phoenixact.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Phoenix Act</a> to extend the statute of limitations, including from this progressive example on data collecting, there may no witnesses or intimidated witnesses, and that can stop help for the victim. </p>

<p>Update July 21, 2020:</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer Adam Waldman and others around this case have incited people (and simulations) online to intimidate witnesses and supporters from speaking up, since they are afraid of it impacting their lives, safety, and business relationships.</strong> Adam Waldman also told the NGN in an email that Amber Heard looked like 'gone girl' in February.</p>
<p>She had over 40,000 hateful comments on one IG post. We went onto <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/motivatornetwork/"" rel=""nofollow"">our instagram</a> that month with the purpose to help her.</p>
<p>July 20, 2020: ""MW is now making a complaint about Adam Waldman (who has been tweeting from Court 13) what MW says are <strong>threatening tweets about the witness evidence</strong> - <strong>particularly the “in memoriam”</strong> tweet which is says is macabre.

<p>Journalists have repeatedly responded to the faceless adam_waldman twitter account as if it's a real account. It's posting inciting claims.</p>
<p><strong>The social media companies are not protecting witnesses, victims, or legal cases.</strong> They also do not data collect for it, which is another reason we took screenshots of that alleged partner of ex-staff last year - it would have been lost.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fathers4justice-johnny-depp-amber-heard-court-case-libel-trial-divorce-law-a9628351.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a hateful billboard was seen outside the trial</a>, with groups calling for it to be questioned as 'hate crime' (against women). It is from a UK website for men divorcing women. The group claimed it was the best advertisement in the world for divorce against women. </p>
<p>We've been repeatedly asked if we have been paid to help Amber Heard. <em>The answer is and will always be no.</em> It actually pays <strong>less</strong> to help Amber Heard, because hate and bullying is profitable.</p>
<p><em><strong>We help because we're not bystanders and feel obligated to help her life.</strong> This is nonprofit.</em></p>
<p>Update July 26:</p>
<p>Online crowdfunding harms helping Amber Heard's side to be seen.

<p>Despite her strong evidence, humanitarianism, charity, and leadership, she is questioned online by incited hate and a ""Wild West"" online cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong>If you see something, do something! </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a road map of Amber's innocence in her case.</strong> For example, her arguing, speaking up, or yelling led to 3 physical fights as retaliation by JD against her in the 1 1/2-2 months before audio leak 1.</p>
<p><strong>We support Amber Heard! Interfere online!</strong></p>
<p>Recently L'Oreal which supports Amber Heard endorsed Hollaback's mission to stop harassment. We think technology should be used to help people, and false information and hate is harmful.</p>

<p><strong>-- Believe Abuse Against Women Early, Interfere, and Support Their Leaving --</strong></p>
<p>#StopDomesticViolence - We list Her Side below...</p>
<p><strong>HER SIDE: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>She feared for her life and that JD would 'accidentally' kill her.</strong></li>
<li>She believes JD is an abuser. <strong>She refers to abuse &amp; violence in December, May, and April.</strong>
</li>
<li>IO Tillett called 911 because of escalating violence and she feared physical harm and needed to protect herself.</li>
<li><strong>Bodyguards told her off record that she would be killed, and one is recorded on a phone witnessing violence.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Travis (guard) had to pull JD away from Amber. (JD admits this)</strong></li>
<li><strong>She has collaborating photos and text messages to her mother, family, and friends as proof.</strong></li>
<li><strong>She missed work because of fear of bruising and injuries the next day, and texted Jodi</strong></li>
<li><strong>(Amber Heard is crying, intimidated, and stressed - in the audio and life)</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>She is defending herself</strong> and says it makes JD angry that she defends herself. He is attacking her with abuse even on the phone call.</li>
<li>She has documented evidence, and eyewitness statements over the years of abuse who would provide statements under oath.</li>
<li>She has collaborating texts, photos, and statements with time stamps and matching dates of abuse.</li>
<li>Texts between people, people overhearing their fights, people seeing it the next day of abuse, or responding to the abuse.</li>
<li>She says JD doesn't believe her (crying) and it's pointless, but she's telling the truth with the timeline matching.</li>
<li>She was told she had a strong case of domestic violence, and if she filed against JD, they would prosecute him. She said she wanted to protect him and waited for the RO.</li>
<li>She says she doesn't want to hurt him.</li>
<li>She says JD used TMZ, tabloid media, to smear her credibility. She was *forced* to respond and defend herself.</li>
<li>TMZ was creating lies while she was in LA Court about there not being two sets of police officers at the penthouses. They subpoenaed the the security records as proof.</li>
<li>She cannot overpower him, and there's a large physical difference between them. He claims she 'started' the fights. She has photos, audio, and texts* of abuse. No fair fights in strength or ability.</li>
<li><strong>She, her family, and her friends have received death threats - which is not safety.</strong></li>
<li>JD gets angry about Amber Heard saying he is sending info to the tabloid media and raises his voice, saying she didn't 'make nice nice' and will see her in court.</li>
<li>JD tells Amber she 'doesn't exist to him.' Amber Heard says he doesn't need to be cruel on top of it.</li>
<li>JD says going to court will harm both of them and is telling Amber Heard to use the NDA and written letter to settle.</li>
<li>JD is telling her to not go to court.</li>
<li>JD tells Amber he knows she wants to defend herself and respond.</li>
<li>JD acknowledges fights between Amber and him in the past, it's already known and out there, and mentions the NDA &amp; letter.</li>
<li>She says her credibility was dishonestly smeared. JD says the abuse needs to be dealt with (NDA).</li>
<li>JD blames Amber for being *forced* to defend, protect herself, and to respond and for the smearing of her in the tabloid media and online.</li>
<li>Amber Heard did not want any of this to happen and to be forced to defend herself, but JD won't believe her. She has the timeline (crying).</li>
<li>She says she only has her integrity...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amber Heard has a long-term leadership, humanitarian, positive background with credibility: </strong></p>
<p>She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office. She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.</p>
<p>- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, and Human Rights Campaign.</p>
<p>- Spoken at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala.</p>
<p><strong>She's Mera in the movie Aquaman. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We created this video &amp; petition because we would prevent &amp; stop abuse against women... </strong></p>

<p><strong>The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B9nIeehoSdx/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">ACLU further is against harassment of women online</a>, and we can see that it creates distortions to escalate violence, threats, discrimination, and lack of safety. </strong></p>
<p>Her ex, further, <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/depp-fails-comply-judges-orders-amber-heard-files-motion-continuance"" rel=""nofollow"">has refused to provide evidence during discovery</a>, including the <strong>70,000 texts and emails</strong> sent to The Sun, which is now known by the parties for Amber Heard. Although <a href=""https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Depp-v-News-Group-decision-on-disclosure-FINAL.pdf#page=9"" rel=""nofollow"">the texts between Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany</a> were not allowed in the UK because they were sent without permission, even if they show clear violence and threats with graphic details, it's still being exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: On March 18, 2020:</strong> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B94hFCcqqd_/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>In UK Court again, texts</strong> between JD and his doctor</a> reveal that he admits twice to harming his own finger during the 3 day blackout where he abused and assaulted Amber Heard in Australia as seen in the <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/18/johnny-depp-told-doctor-chopped-finger/"" rel=""nofollow"">Telegraph</a>. However, the exploitation of social status online caused mobs to believe lies from JD accusing her, despite it being not logical for afar vs close up.</p>
<p>It possibly ended up beneficial that JD caused the case to be postponed to August in the end by refusing to provide evidence, since The Sun case is beforehand and provides credibility, as well as exposing the other violence and abuse in texts as if precedence.</p>
<p><strong>Court documents in Virginia from March 16, 2020 show that witnesses such as Laura Divenere have been coerced</strong>, given leading questions, given false information, and intimidated by JD's lawyer Adam Waldman. A <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6811708-Laura.html"" rel=""nofollow"">recorded conversation's transcript</a> shows the inappropriate actions by Waldman.</p>
<p><strong>It's clear that there are continuing moves to cover up the domestic abuse of Amber Heard and ruin her humanitarian work, resources, and any positive support. </strong></p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.screengeek.net/2020/02/24/amber-heard-aquaman-2-loreal-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">ScreenGeek</a>, Feb 24: ""A source close to the situation has told us:</p>
<p>'<strong>Warner Bros. doesn’t care about the allegations made about Amber Heard nor do they have interest in social media.</strong> <strong>As such, there’s nothing going on with her role on Aquaman 2 and they wouldn’t consider firing her.</strong> The petitions to get her dropped from L’Oreal are also highly unlikely to go anywhere with the company. L’Oreal runs Amber Heard’s social media pages and are very fond of her.'</p>
<p>The source continues to explain there’s a lot more going on with the case as well, including evidence that could be damaging against Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>'In fact, there’s much more to these allegations than what’s been revealed so far. This is why Amber Heard hasn’t settled with Johnny Depp. While the audio recordings with Amber Heard don’t look good, <strong>Amber still has incredibly damaging evidence</strong> against Johnny Depp. With that said, Amber Heard and her legal team have chosen to do everything involving their case in court rather than rely on social media.'""</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZwWGBfApM4"" rel=""nofollow"">Amber Heard spoke at the Women's March in Los Angeles</a> in January</strong>, referring to 3 years where she suffered. Like other women, <strong>she has not received aid, support, or respect</strong> and has been treated as a discretely silenced second-class citizen.</p>
<p>""That's why many of us choose to not speak up,"" stated Amber Heard.</p>
<p><strong>From the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/va-house-passes-bill-aimed-at-lawsuits-by-devin-nunes-johnny-depp/2020/02/11/865115f4-4cef-11ea-9b5c-eac5b16dafaa_story.html#click=https://t.co/T51R33Lt55"" rel=""nofollow"">Washington Post</a>, Feb 11</strong>: </p>
<p>""The Virginia legislature passed bills Tuesday that would make it harder to pursue frivolous lawsuits designed to chill free speech, a response to a string of splashy defamation cases filed in state courts by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), actor Johnny Depp and others...</p>
<p>Their targets include CNN, the New York Times, Twitter, <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/court-proceeding-reveal-johnny-depp-threatened-burn-drown-ex-wife-amber-heard/"" rel=""nofollow"">the actress Amber Heard</a>, the Fresno Bee and a parody Twitter account in the voice of an imaginary cow.</p>
<p>...meaning someone with deep pockets can harass a defendant with expensive and protracted litigation. Such cases are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP.</p>
<p>Virginia’s new anti-SLAPP bills would afford defendants stronger protections.""</p>
<p><strong>Amber Heard fan groups on Instagram finally saw our petition</strong>, and there are also a few other petitions in support of her now appearing. We thank them for sharing, linking in their IG bios, and finally realizing the need to be an <strong>activist and leader</strong> such as Amber Heard would be!</p>
<p>It's <strong>preventive, rather than reactionary</strong>, as we see with other ""Free [name here]"" movements, such as Kesha or Britney Spears, it's often done too late or afterwards. It affects everyone in the industry and it can affect people around public figures, such as ex-staff or <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE"" rel=""nofollow"">those knowing them</a>. They're <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/"" rel=""nofollow"">not bulletproof</a>. </p>
<p>We're thankful that <a href=""https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Depp-v-News-Group-decision-on-disclosure-FINAL.pdf#page=9"" rel=""nofollow"">70,000 texts and emails (see page 9 of UK Court filing of texts from 2013 and 2014 referring to <em>different instances</em> of threats and violence)</a> were sent to The Sun for the United Kingdom Court case by the ex-legal team and lawyers of her ex. Originally, it was 400 to be disclosed. However, it was sent civilly, and not to the law. Someone possibly did the ethical and right choice. It's shown earlier that ex-staff or others <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE"" rel=""nofollow"">may be too afraid to testify</a>. Similarly, a paralegal spoke up about Spears. We can see similar movements, if it's noticed.</p>
<p><strong><em>In dangerous situations such as Amber Heard is in</em> involving physical abuse, threats to life, coercive control, collusion, and high amounts of money, it's especially important for people to protect and stand up for the victim. </strong></p>
<p>Are We All Celebrities Now? <strong><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/amber-heard-revenge-porn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Amber Heard spoke up for others and equal rights in her New York Times Op-Ed</a>.</strong></p>
<p>""Denying the right of anyone, famous or not, to exercise control over who is allowed to see their naked bodies or to witness their intimate activities is to deny their humanity...</p>
<p>Today everyone is one step away from becoming famous. The power of social media makes it possible for any person to be dragged before the eyes of the world...</p>
<p>Every person, from the most famous to the most obscure, from the privileged to the poor, deserves privacy.""</p>
<p>How you treat public figures expands outwards and sets an example. There should be equal status.</p>
<p>We link to it, and <strong>we want Amber Heard's humanitarian work and leadership to continue. To do that, she needs to keep her career and resources.</strong></p>
<p>We are glad that Amber protected herself against the cyberbullying on IG which also likely included paid comments to boost negativity with spam to create false online distortions. Ex JD was already a liability to producers with numerous lawsuits, and her Washington Post Op-Ed was written the month <em>after</em> he lost 1 role while he has others and high financial means. We continue to defend her!</p>
<p>We posted <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX27126jVLQ"" rel=""nofollow"">Amber Heard's Side of the Audio Leak 2</a>, where she says she feared for her life, and other evidence (#BeNotABystander).</p>

We ask: <strong>""Would you save her""?</strong></p>
<p>Simple question, but it's on our petition to <strong>Support Amber Heard in Aquaman 2</strong>: <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2</a></p>
<p>We also refer to charity &amp; activism. It's olympic about how many nonprofits Amber is involved with and many who did not have public support.</p>
<p><strong>This petition was shortly changed and emailed to DC and Warner Brothers before Melissa came out about domestic abuse with her 14 minute video here a week ago: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4LZGXZgxg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4LZGXZgxg</a></strong></p>
<p>""I stand with Melissa Benoist"" and ""We stand with Amber Heard.""</p>
<p>They're NOT bulletproof.</p>
<p>Melissa Benoist, Supergirl of the DC/WB, <a href=""https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/"" rel=""nofollow"">was able to say that she defended herself and still received support.</a> Amber Heard was one of the first or only people to state she was domestically abused as the larger victim. Amber dealt with the mobs against her, and likely because of that, Melissa is able to come forward even if there were two-way fights. </p>
<p>There's an <a href=""https://twitter.com/AmberHeardIT/status/1203988651820101632?s=20"" rel=""nofollow"">Instagram video from Amber which may be hidden clues</a>. While looking tired, she says ""Because of this hair and pajamas, it must mean I am bulletproof."" <strong>She's not actually bulletproof</strong> and frequently people will put in metaphors and hidden messages on their social media, because they're unable to be public today. </p>
<p>This photo with a pillow is interesting, since it escalated in the fights to her waking up to a bloody pillow which was seen by IO Tillett: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B6EHDuthyjF/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/p/B6EHDuthyjF/</a></p>

<p><strong>To prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED!</strong> Believe early, let them escape early. We were told to not screenshot a partner of ex-JD staff's tweets and messages, but we DID. We were also told to not create a petition, but we DID.</p>
<p>Jane Doe said: <strong>""celebrities hiding bruises while going to events is common...""</strong></p>
<p>The Jane Does saying she was the partner of Ex-JD staff supported Amber and said she was kicked, hit, and crying.

<p>Amber Heard and Melissa Benoist are<em> CRIME VICTIMS</em> which should also be a protected class.</p>
<p><strong>If you don't support victims now, then the agenda to silence them will continue. Duty To Rescue and Duty to Care.</strong></p>
<p>We also got the database fixed for the article on Amber's friend calling 911 for her.

<p><strong>We want to see her in more films, movies, shows, modeling shoots, and work in the entertainment industry.</strong></p>

<p>We created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. Would you prevent or stop domestic abuse? The social question is also: ""Would you save her?""</p>
<p>Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his fans, both financially and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.</p>

<p>It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.</p>
<p>We have to take a stand now. They're trying to remove Amber Heard's jobs, career, resources, financial support, and they harass her and organizations (even the charities, UN, and ACLU) for years for supporting her.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality.</strong></p>
