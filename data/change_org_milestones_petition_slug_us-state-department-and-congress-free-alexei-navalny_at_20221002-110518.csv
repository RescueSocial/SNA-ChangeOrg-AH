StarterPetitionUpdate,29615825,2021-09-17T16:08:05.000Z,,Appeal the Ban of Navalny Voting App from Google and Apple Servers,"<p>Dear Supporters of Democracy Worldwide,</p>
<p>Russia will be hosting its elections and Putin and his colleagues are resorting to hardline tactics to secure his victory in a rigged election. Alexei Navalny's ""Smart Voting "" App, which is Russia's only chance at <br>a fair method of tabulating votes, has now been removed the servers of Apple and Google products, a sign that these two tech companies, crucial to the social media structure of the world, have now cratered to pressure from Vladimir Putin.<br>I urge you to write your elected official to appeal this decision, as well as to the CEOs of Google and Apple, Sundar Pinchai and Tim Cook, respectively. Below are their emails and a form letter for you to send directly to them.<br>Without your intervention, Vladimir will continue to reign over Russia for another 6 years, and possibly for life. <br>Your action is urgent, they will vote next week!!</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cook,</p>
<p>I understand you recently decided to remove the Alexei Navalny voting app from the servers of Apple products. Doing so would eliminate the possibility of a free and fair election. If you value our system of free elections, we urge you <br>to reconsider your decision.</p>

<p>Thank you all for you support!! Since our last petition, we have reached our goal of 1,000 signatures and are approaching 3,000.</p>
<p>The quickest way you can help:<br>a) donate to help promote this petition on change.org. Every dollar helps, I myself have donated more than $500.<br>b) share this petition on your networks online and offline</p>
<p>As you know, Navalny has been sentenced to 3 years prison time. However, his influence has not waned, in fact it may have grown stronger. US and European Union have condemned <br>sanctioned Russia, there is united agreement on the unfairness of how Navalny is being treated. He has a right to express his views.</p>
<p>Below is a link to an interview on TIME magazine  with, Leonid Volkov, Navalny's chief of staff, which is very useful to understanding the situation. A key idea is that sanctions work, so please urge your head of stateto sanction Putin and his elites, or his financial resources by cutting their access and ties to US and European Union- e.g. being able to own property in US and Europe, sending their children to school there, doing business with those countries, etc. Putin's empire is subsidized through his wealthy backers.</p>
<p><br>Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>Thank you all for you support!! Since the last update we have gained over 500 petitions! We are now at 657, and our goal is to reach 1,000. Please share with your networks via email, social media and word of mouth.</p>
<p>We have made great progress since the last update:</p>
<p>1) Navalny's video of Putin's palace has been viewed more than 100 times</p>
<p>2) US State Department, President Joe Biden and many members of Congress have condemned Navalny's imprisonment</p>
<p>3) The Russian Government has gone on the defensive, asking the US and other countries to ""stay out of its affairs,"" and claiming that it is not ""afraid"" of Navalny. The need to state this  indicates the influence Navalny has on the Russian people over whom they govern, and this can be interpreted Putin's state of mind as being the exact opposite: he is fearful of Navalny, who is not afraid of taking on the government singlehandedly, with the support of the Russian people.</p>
<p>Please share this petition and keep the momentum for democracy and free speech and elections worldwide. <br>Thank you for your support!!</p>
