We Love Amber Heard and Support her! We're so happy to finally see someone who speaks up against domestic violence publicly!
The Judge ruled that 12 violent incidents against Amber Heard from Johnny Depp were proven last year, but we still need to support her against violence caused from online. She's astroturfed by social bots, which is a lot like BlackCube which targeted actresses between 2017 to now.

Read some great words from supporters of Amber Heard:

""I am so sorry, Amber! I have been thinking of you a lot today because of this. You don't deserve such treatment. A lot of people believe you. You have helped a lot of people by using your voice. I'm proud of you. Take care of yourself. Know people are in your corner.""

""I'm so proud of you and your support of abused women. There's no excuse for a man to hit or raise his hands at a woman. Amber heard is the best""

""I've stood with you since day one! Thank you for your strength and courage, you inspire me and many women not to be afraid""

""you are so strong and brave we are with you #IStandWithAmber""

Keep up the good work - myself and others are silenced in the face of society, with fear of ridicule or misunderstanding of the impact of the different levels of domestic abuse, and we've previously been told to not help victims of domestic abuse in the community.

Female victims of domestic abuse should not be hidden - hopefully society's response will be to publicly help women in domestic violence, and be the force so strong - that WE should step in to stop it - that it decreases abuse overall.
Domestic abuse is the most heinous of crimes as it's unavoidable. You cannot just leave your home - that's where you live, sleep, and get comfort!

“In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure no one listens.”
― Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror

“... in practice the standard for what constitutes rape is set not at the level of women's experience of violation but just above the level of coercion acceptable to men.”
― Judith Lewis Herman

""Pornography has been so thickly glossed over with the patina of chic these days in the name of verbal freedom and sophisication… Part of the problem is that those who traditionally have been the most vigorous opponents of porn are often those same people who shudder at the explicit mention of any sexual subject… There can be no equality in porn, no female equivalent, no turning of the tables in the name of bawdy fun. Pornography, like rape, is a male invention, desgined to dehumanize women… Pornography is the undiluted essence of anti-female propoganda.""
Susan Brownmiller

""Pornography is used in rape - to plan it, to execute it, to choreograph it, to engender the excitement to commit the act.""
Andrea Dworkin

The worldwide misogyny and contempt for women are expressed, above all, in sadistic pornography and forced prostitution worldwide in such an extreme form that we have to speak of sexual femicide and sexual terrorism for men.


Misogynist thinking and acting is everyday life in Germany. For example, every fourth woman and every second girl in Germany experiences beatings or rape.
Causes of misogyny are also male and female role models that are deeply anchored in society: men and boys should be tough and take what they want, women and girls should be sexy and available.
These role models supposedly provide orientation, but ultimately ""posing"" often prevents boys and girls / men and women from getting really close.
In the worst case, the unconscious replay of role models leads to violence against women, girls and female children because they are treated like objects.
Violence against women occurs in all social classes and groups. Specifically, in 2017 alone 114,000 acts of violence in partnerships were reported in which women were the victims. The number of unreported cases is very high. According to a Europe-wide study, only about 13 percent of women affected report serious incidents of violence to the police. Why is that? How is it that so many men do not regard women as equals and treat them disrespectfully?
Sexism, pornography and misogyny are ubiquitous around the world. E.g. when a group of guys talk about who ""cleared"" a girl. Because boys use it to express that they perceive girls as objects. ""Things"" that a man ""gets"", ""takes"" or ""belongs to"".
Many young women play this game, mostly unconsciously: by portraying themselves as a sexual object through outward appearances, including on social media, and by expecting the young man to take the first step and conquer them. And here you have to speak of a brainwashing of women by the media, society and politics. Because if female children, girls and women already feel worthless and let themselves be pushed into the role of sex dolls and birthing machines, why should men and boys still have respect for such objects that they consider completely worthless and see them as human beings?
There is toxic masculinity everywhere, which manifests itself in the so-called macho culture, rape culture, forced and child marriages, honor killings, acid assassinations, forced veiling, FGM, dowry and witch killings, the accusing, imprisoning, torturing and executing female victims, stoning is very popular here in Muslim countries for girls and women, in war, mass, group rape, sexual assault on the street, in school, university or at work, not to mention the very common domestic violence and sexual child abuse.
It is not optimistic about the horrific crimes and hate crimes against women around the world, mostly with impunity!
And anyone who wants to take refuge in music as a woman will be unpleasantly surprised:
In hip hop, men sing about how they make women ""clear"", feel superior to them, abuse them. All of this is sold as ""cool"" and often hits the charts. At the expense of women. A lot of porn has a similar dynamic: Here, too, male power fantasies are served. Even the porn actress Lena Nitro sees this critically: She demands a porn driver's license so that no one under 18 can watch porn films. In any case, porn gives a completely wrong picture of what ""normal sexuality"" is.
Porn scripts do not know equality! The biggest misogynists are clearly pornographers because they glorify violence, torture, humiliation, sexual femicide. That has nothing to do with normal sexuality!
Anyone who doesn't know each other well and cannot confidently say what he / she (does not) want comes under pressure from porn. Typical porn scripts are not about two people agreeing on an equal footing about what they enjoy. Rather, the man generally exercises power over the woman. He takes what he wants and she has to obey. Basically, both genders lose: women lose their dignity and both the freedom for feelings and the chance to be close.
What happens with pornography and re-enactment during intercourse is something like this: ""This is exactly what happens with porn, that it is not fun of equal value, but rather a 'I'm going off on her and taking my fun out of it'.""

There is also an understanding of hierarchy, for example that men are superior. Misogyny is used to secure male power and dominance in society.
Role patterns can be observed almost everywhere: in the school yard, in the disco, at public festivals. Here alcohol, crowds and wide-cut, short dirndls ensure that inhibitions fall. Where is the line between flirtation and assault? Are short dresses or large necklines an ""invitation to grope""? - A couple of men interviewed by moderator Ramo Ali tend to give it a try. And some even see a ""no"" as an occasion to become more persistent.
The women, in turn, report regular attacks: verbally and tangibly. As a female you almost have to expect that at an event like the Regensburg Maidult, a small ""Oktoberfest"". One of the women questioned is nevertheless outraged: Dressing sexy does not mean that she wants to be touched everywhere. Even when inhibitions are falling, men should know that ""just reaching out"" is taboo.
And they don't know that from my 65-year-old life experience. The so-called catcalling with often disgusting slogans and insults is familiar to every woman, every woman and every girl knows such slogans and such behavior at celebrations, parties and events, often enough it also happens at school, at university and at work. Even at home, women are not safe there, even in their own four walls and at family celebrations there is a lot to be heard and anyone who does not smile and join in here as a woman is considered abnormal and at best a brake on fun!
That is why it is damned important not to participate anymore as a woman and to say: Stop it, enough now, we are human beings and we want to be treated as such!
In courses for feminist self-assertion, women learn to build inner strength and clearly convey their limits: So far and no further! It starts with making them aware of their limits. Then they mentally act out dangerous situations: What to do if steps approach from behind in the dark? Anna Pytlak has had traumatic experiences. The very thought of the steps from behind triggers a panic attack in her. Other participants react less dramatically. However, many find it difficult to act loudly and decisively at the crucial moment instead of becoming silent and rigid. But this determination can be trained.

Learning to assert yourself can empower women individually. But in order to really fight misogyny, other role models are needed across society.
Unfortunately there are damned many forms of sexual violence and sexual violence has not decreased, no increased, because we live in the thought of pseudo-equality that does not exist worldwide. The men still have the real say, they just want to make us believe that this is not the case and that if we feel that way, we should urgently see a psychiatrist:

Forms of (sexual) violence against women:

In music videos or pornographic films, women often become mere objects: a ""thing"" that men can use. Women and girls are denied a right to self-determination.
""Victim blaming"" happens frequently: women are persuaded that it is their own fault that they have been the victim of an assault. For example because they were wearing a mini skirt.
Femicide means: women are killed because they are women. For example, because they had sex or were raped before marriage. The perpetrators, mostly from the family, call this ""honor killing"".
Women are also victims of digital violence on the Internet. Women are regularly victims of digital stalking by their exes.

What equality really looks like can be observed every day by women around the world from the sexual cyberstalking, the sexual online terror and the misogynistic online haters, it is a modern sexual witch hunt that takes place without exception on all women, the pornography of all society has lowered the inhibition threshold damn well!
Our society lays the roots for sexism and misogyny early on, for example with role models. It takes a lot of (self) awareness and a lot of conversations between men and women to get more understanding and respect for one another. In this way, ""toxic"" masculinity and violence against women can be reduced step by step. But that can only happen if paid rape in the worst and sadistic form such as pornography and prostitution is finally abolished worldwide and permanently. We women neither need prostitution nor pornography nor men in this world who claim that they cannot live without it.

Hate crime: Deepfakes
Deepfakes: Blackmail 2.0

Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced using artificial intelligence are flooding the Internet. They are becoming easier and easier to manufacture. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can hit any woman - with nude pictures and porn.

In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in their sleeves for horny office stallions. If you turned the pen upside down, the woman was undressed. What wasn't funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake.

The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - that is, machine learning with artificial intelligence and falsification. The result is software that creates photos and videos that appear deceptively real, for example by placing Ms. X's head on top of Ms. Y's. A clothed person can also simply be stripped naked in a photo. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.

What a few years ago special software was needed for, an app is sufficient today!

What a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, an app is sufficient today. The Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, takes a single portrait photo to cut a person's face in video clips, including in porn scenes, of course.

The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were deceptively realistically mounted in pornography.

A popular victim: feminist Emma Watson. That's especially cool, because she's not just a woman, she's also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer who is trendy right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart.

But it doesn't just hit stars, it can hit any woman. With the “deepfake revenge porn” a genre of its own has now emerged. The ex-girlfriend's face is tinkered into a porno and sent to friends. Often women are even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. 55,000 of this “revenge porn” are checked by Facebook every month.

The same principle applies to nude photos that are created using deepfake software. The software inserts deceptively real parts of a synthetically produced woman's body at the point where the body is clothed, according to the body shape. The artificially created naked body is extremely close to the real one.

The messenger service Telegram, for example, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nude images, has fallen into disrepute. The program is even designed specifically for women. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo that has been manipulated into a nude picture.

Fake nude photos and porn videos are often sent to parents.

So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude photos have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. Women in the Arab world have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers.

At the end of October, Apple implemented a lock so that iPhones and iPads can no longer access the Telegram bot. It still works on Android devices and Telegram's MacOS app. Telegram was founded by Pawel Durow, known as the ""Russian Mark Zuckerberg"". Most of the users worldwide who use the nude picture function come from Eastern Europe.

Apart from the fact that mostly women are victims of these fakes, fake videos and photos further destroy the trust in the media, which has already been broken. Anything can be a lie. Republican politicians in the vicinity of Trump have already questioned the video showing the violent death of George Floyd. These forgeries undermine democracy.

And the judiciary? Once again, that can't keep up. Every journalistic product must answer in terms of press law. But internet providers seem to operate in an unlawful area, they ""only"" provide the software. The rest is done by the users. Both violate personal rights and copyrights - and human dignity - thousands of times without being prosecuted in any way.

But there is another way. Australia has made making deepfakes a criminal offense. Offenders have been jailed there for several years since 2018. Where there is a will, there is a way.

I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment for 17 years by a psychopathic Islamist Australian ex-renter and his very bad misogynist friends.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k. The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.
The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
Computers have changed so much in our daily lives that they have had a huge impact on crime too. Over time, the number of criminal offenses has increased as individuals have used computer technology to better organize every aspect of their lives, from finance and dating to work and process automation. This has created a multitude of gray areas and led to unclear laws that attempt to regulate the types of information that can be posted or shared online.
One aspect of online culture that is changing both the dating and legal landscape is sharing explicit personal photos or nudes. With easy access to amazing cameras right in our pocket, we can share photos with loved ones right away. At the same time, digital technology has made it easier than ever to distribute or share these types of photos online. This has led to an increase in what women worldwide call sexual cyber harassment.
Sexual assaults usually take place via private messages in chats, messengers and communities. Increasingly, harassment can also be observed in public, e.g. as a comment under videos or in the chat on live streams. Even the first pictures and sentences can be annoying, and sometimes the attacks only start after a short small talk. Many victims are minors!
Most of the time, the harassers ask children and young people about their sexual experiences or describe their own sexual practices and wishes. The victims are then asked to perform sexual acts on themselves or others, or even to perform webcam broadcasts. Pornographic files and links are often transmitted.
These crimes are still not punished, why not?

Women fight back, because only then can you finally put an end to this indescribable misery.

Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism /Julia Long (Author)
Anti-porn feminism is back. Countering the ongoing ""pornification"" of Western culture and society, anti-porn movements are powerfully re-emerging among a new generation of feminist activists in the UK and worldwide.
Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Porn Feminism examines the ways in which the new feminist arguments and campaigns around pornography are articulated, deployed and received. Drawing on original, ethnographic research, it provides an in-depth analysis of the ideological stance, tactical repertoires, impact and significance of campaign groups challenging the pornography industry.
This unique and inspiring book explains the astonishing comeback of anti-porn feminism and challenges liberal perspectives and the mainstreaming on pornography of pornography that changes the nature of our intimate relationships.

Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions/Gloria Steinem (Author)
Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983, acclaimed for its witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world, ""as if women mattered."" Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the now-famous exposé, ""I Was a Playboy Bunny,"" to the moving tribute to her mother ""Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)"". Her prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography that are still referenced and relevant today, and the hilarious satire, ""If Men Could Menstruate” resonates as much as ever.
As Watson writes of Steinem in her foreword, “She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading into something not only relatable, but also enjoyable... Her plain common sense, calling things out as they are, will make you laugh out loud. This is her superpower.”

Pornography: Men Possessing Women/Andrea Dworkin (Author)
This strongly argued feminist case against pornography stirred tremendous controversy when first published in 1979, and has lost none of its bite. Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: ""Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance."" Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency.

Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality/Gail Dines (Author)
Professor Gail Dines has written about and researched the porn industry for over two decades. She attends industry conferences, interviews producers and performers, and speaks to hundreds of men and women each year about their experience with porn. Students and educators describe her work as “life changing.”
In Pornland—the culmination of her life’s work—Dines takes an unflinching look at porn and its affect on our lives. Astonishingly, the average age of first viewing porn is now 11.5 years for boys, and with the advent of the Internet, it’s no surprise that young people are consuming more porn than ever. But, as Dines shows, today’s porn is strikingly different from yesterday’s Playboy. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. To differentiate their products in a glutted market, producers have created profitable niche products—like teen sex, torture porn, and gonzo—in order to entice a generation of desensitized users.
Going from the backstreets to Wall Street, Dines traces the extensive money trail behind this multibillion-dollar industry—one that reaps more profits than the film and music industries combined. Like Big Tobacco—with its powerful lobbying groups and sophisticated business practices—porn companies don’t simply sell products. Rather they influence legislators, partner with mainstream media, and develop new technologies like streaming video for cell phones. Proving that this assembly line of content is actually limiting our sexual freedom, Dines argues that porn’s omnipresence has become a public health concern we can no longer ignore.

Sexual Harassment Online: Shaming and Silencing Women in the Digital Age/Tania G. Levey
Women who use social media are often subjected to blatant sexual harassment, facing everything from name calling to threats of violence. Aside from being disturbing, what does this abuse tell us about gender and sexual norms? And can we use the Internet to resist, even transform, destructive misogynistic norms?
Exploring the language of shaming and silencing women in the cybersphere, Tania Levey addresses these questions and also considers how online attempts to regulate women’s behavior intersect with issues of race, ethnicity, and class.

Sexting and Revenge Pornography: Legislative and Social Dimensions of a Modern Digital Phenomenon/ Andy Phippen (Author), Maggie Brennan (Author)
This book considers the rapidly evolving, both legally and socially, nature of image-based abuse, for both minors and adults. Drawing mainly from UK data, legislation and case studies, it presents a thesis that the law is, at best, struggling to keep up with some fundamental issues around image based abuse, such as the sexual nature of the crimes and the long term impact on victims, and at worst, in the case of supporting minors, not fit for purpose. It shows, through empirical and legislative analysis, that the dearth of education around this topic, coupled with cultural norms, creates a victim blaming culture that extends into adulthood. It proposes both legislative developments and need for wider stakeholder engagement to understand and support victims, and the impact the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can have on their long-term mental health and life in general. The book is of interest to scholar of law, criminology, sociology, police and socio-technical studies, and is also to those who practice law, law enforcement or wider social care role in both child and adult safeguarding.

Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating /Alexandra Tweten (Author)
After one too many hostile dating app encounters, Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account @ByeFelipe, a place for women to protest the horrors of online dating, and to share stories and screenshots of their own experiences. Three years later, the account has become a forum where women can fight back against the men who have made them uncomfortable, scared, and embarrassed -- and to laugh at the appalling men they encounter.
The name of Bye Felipe is a nod to the ""Bye Felicia"" meme, which Urban Dictionary defines as a cool dismissal of a noxious person. In that spirit, the book helps women navigate the perils that come with swiping right and provides practical steps to overcome the harassment rampant in the dating app ether. Blending humor, feminist theory, and solidarity, this ""field guide"" provides profiles of the worst types of guys (also known as ""Felipes"") -- from the classic fat shamer to the mansplainer to the surprise sociopath -- answers questions like ""How do I react when a guy sends me a dic pic?,"" and gives women the tools they need to take control of their dating life. With stories, screenshots, and Riot Grrrl-esque graphic art throughout, Bye Felipe empowers women to stand up for themselves and uphold the confidence and self-worth Felipes try so desperately to steal.

Know My Name: The Survivor of the Stanford Sexual Assault Case Tells Her Story/Chanel Miller (Autor)
To girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought every day for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you.'
Chanel Miller's story changed our world forever. In 2016 Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail after he was caught sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. His light sentencing, and Chanel's victim impact statement, which was read by eleven million people in four days, sparked international outrage and action.
Know My Name is an intimate, profoundly moving memoir that exposes a patriarchal culture biased to protect perpetrators, a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and ultimately shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. Entwining pain, resilience, and humour, this breath-taking memoir will stand as a modern classic.

I Have the Right To: A High School Survivor's Story of Sexual Assault, Justice, and Hope /Chessy Prout (Autor)
The numbers are staggering: nearly one in five girls ages fourteen to seventeen have been the victim of a sexual assault or attempted sexual assault. This is the true story of one of those girls.
In 2014, Chessy Prout was a freshman at St. Paul’s School, a prestigious boarding school in New Hampshire, when a senior boy sexually assaulted her as part of a ritualized game of conquest. Chessy bravely reported her assault to the police and testified against her attacker in court. Then, in the face of unexpected backlash from her once-trusted school community, she shed her anonymity to help other survivors find their voice.
This memoir is more than an account of a horrific event. It takes a magnifying glass to the institutions that turn a blind eye to such behavior and a society that blames victims rather than perpetrators. Chessy’s story offers real, powerful solutions to upend rape culture as we know it today. Prepare to be inspired by this remarkable young woman and her story of survival, advocacy, and hope in the face of unspeakable trauma.

Tears of the Silenced: An Amish True Crime Memoir of Childhood Sexual Abuse, Brutal Betrayal, and Ultimate Survival/Misty Griffin (Autor)
When Misty Griffin was six years old, her family started to live and dress like the Amish. Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their stepfather kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care.
When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. After she escaped and reported the bishop, she found herself alone in a modern world with only a second-grade education and no ID or social security card.
Misty has a message for abuse survivors: “Please be encouraged, the cycle of abuse can be broken. This is my story of survival and moving past the abuse to embrace my dreams.” In June 2019 Misty graduated nursing school. She continues to work to raise awareness about child abuse and sexual assault.

Broken and Betrayed: The True Story of the Rotherham Abuse Scandal by the Woman Who Fought to Expose It/ Jayne Senior (Autor) 
For fourteen years, Jayne Senior tried to help girls from Rotherham who had been groomed, raped, tortured, pimped and threatened with violence by sex traffickers. As the manager of Risky Business, which was set up to work with vulnerable teens, she heard heartbreaking and shocking stories of abuse and assiduously kept notes and details of the perpetrators, passing information on to the authorities in the belief that they would do something. Eventually, when she lost hope that the authorities would take action against the gangs she had identified as the abusers, she became a whistleblower for The Times investigative reporter Andrew Norfolk.
Now, in her powerful memoir Broken and Betrayed, she describes a life spent working to protect Rotherham's girls, the pressure put on her to stop rocking the boat, and why she risked prison in the hope that she could help end the appalling child exploitation in the town.
