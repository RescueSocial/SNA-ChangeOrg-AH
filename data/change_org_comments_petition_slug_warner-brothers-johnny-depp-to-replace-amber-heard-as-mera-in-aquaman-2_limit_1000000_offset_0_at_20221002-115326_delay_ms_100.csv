The recent decision to drop Mr Depp from the fantastic beasts series while continuing affiliations with his abuser amber heard is making the moral stance of Warner Brothers abundantly clear and will leave a scar on your reputation. 

You have the choice to show that you have a strong stance for family values and human rights by denouncing domestic violence in a way that makes it clear that you care about your public.
