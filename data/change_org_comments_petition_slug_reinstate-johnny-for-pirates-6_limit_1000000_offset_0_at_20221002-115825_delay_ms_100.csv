832578128,"Women and men have equal rights. All people have the right to live free from violence and discrimination. Violent behavior is generally punishable by us, it is a criminal act.
and anyway

    Violence is commonplace for many women. It takes place worldwide and in all cultures. It occurs in all social classes, regardless of income, level of education and social status.
    The crime scene is often your own home. Domestic violence against women therefore takes place in the supposed shelter of one's own four walls.
    In 97% of all cases, the perpetrator is the husband or partner. Overall, almost every third woman experiences violence from her husband/partner. Women are five times more likely to be murdered by their husbands than vice versa. The highest risk for a woman of being murdered is during the time she is separating from her abuser.
Domestic violence against women has many faces

    Physical violence such as hitting, kicking, choking, tying up, inflicting injuries.
    Psychological violence such as intimidating, threatening, insulting, scaring, controlling.
    Sexual violence as a special form of psychological and/or physical violence that women experience in a special way as hurtful or humiliating.
    Social violence such as a ban or coercion to work, use of money as a means of pressure. Children are often victims of violence and are used as leverage against their partner

There are different myths about the causes of violence

    They downplay the act and excuse the perpetrator: ""He only hits because he was drinking"", ""He was under stress and his hand slipped"".
    But: Being drunk or stressed is no excuse for violence. And acts of violence against women are rarely one-off lapses, but mostly recurring abuse.
    They assign blame and responsibility to the woman: “she provoked him”, “she chose him”, “she can leave him after all”.
    But: Hardly any man is violent right at the beginning of the relationship. And whatever happens between the two - it does not legitimize violence. Separation usually provokes new violence and usually burdens the woman with the burden of an insecure existence and the loss of social and material security.
    They give society the right to look the other way: ""Family disputes are private matters.""
    But: A marriage certificate is not a license to use violence. Violent acts are criminal acts both outside and inside the home.

Domestic violence against women is rarely sanctioned by society

It is considered a private problem, a family dispute. The perpetrators usually remain unmolested and are not held accountable. The public and social institutions condone the abuse of women in the home. Women's shelters and shelters are a first step in a new direction. However, they are the only places where women can find protection from violence and support.
The experience reports that women post online under #metoo show one thing above all: We live in a society in which violence against women is considered normal. So normal that even women often don't even notice them. In a culture where women are considered the most available, thanks in no small part to pornography.

Why do we believe the perpetrators more than the victims. One example is the famous actress Amber Heard, who is facing an unprecedented media witch hunt for exposing the extreme levels of domestic and sexual violence committed by her ex-husband,  the popular Johnny Depp. Public sympathy is on Johnny Depp's side despite an English court ruling confirming Johnny Depp's sexual, narcisstic and domestic violence. However, he is not as harmless as he claims. He pushed his ex-girlfriend Kate Moss down the stairs and publicly berated his ex-girlfriend Vanessa Paradise as a French blackmailing slut. For years he made threats against Amber Heard, along the lines of let's drown her and burn her. So it's unbelievable that this man still has sympathizers and supporters in court like he does these days.
In the current trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, the US actress testified for the first time and accused her ex of ""unbridled violence"". The procedure was the “most painful and difficult” experience of her life. Amber Heard describes Johnny Depp's most horrific sexual, physical and psychological abuse in court. Most people feel  no compassion for Amber Heard, no, on the contrary. An abused woman who fights back is undesirable worldwide and this is also shown to her in the media and in court. Such a woman is subjected to a witch hunt instead of dangerous narcissistic, high dangerous and psychopathic men being locked away. Unfortunately...

	How many times have you read a news story about a woman accusing someone of abuse only to scroll down to read the comments? Most likely, nestled among a few well-meaning comments of support, you found a bevy of judgment and shaming directed at the survivor. And, they're coming from both men and women.

“This happened years ago and she’s just talking about it now? Sounds like someone needs attention.”
If it was so bad, why didn’t she leave? I would walk out the door the second a man hit me.”

“She didn’t even report it to the police. She’s probably just making this up.”

“She only wants money.”

Why do some people jump to blame the victim? At its core victim-blaming is about self-preservation.
 In essence, if people can find a reason why abuse is the victim’s fault, then abuse is something that can not only be controlled but prevented. And, in turn, it won’t happen to them.
For Example: It took Donna Kaz 12 years after leaving her abuser to identify as a survivor. It took her 35 years to come out publically about it. Her memoir, UN/MASKED, Memoirs of a Guerrilla Girl On Tour, was published in 2016.
	Disclosure is a process, she says, and one that took her a long time because of fear.

“I was afraid of being shamed and judged,” she says. “There’s still this stigma … a reluctance to believe women’s stories. And I think that hasn’t changed. We need to believe women when they tell their story.”

Kaz’s abuser was the actor William Hurt. Their relationship occurred in the ‘70s, back before domestic violence was really on the radar as a widespread epidemic. Kaz never told anyone she was being abused and she never called the police. She blamed herself.

“You do a sort of self-blaming because there’s so much guilt involved when you’re with an abuser. You blame yourself for staying, you’re embarrassed and it’s shameful. Therefore you don’t talk about it. I think that’s why a lot of women don’t express themselves. They’re sort of trying to figure it out themselves.”

Kaz says that when she did decide to make her story public, she hoped it might help change things.

“You’re led to believe every single person who has come out as being abused by someone, famous or not, is lying,” says Kaz. “I noticed in some interviews [for her book] people don’t even want to talk about the abuse. I hope by telling my story it changes this.”
That is my hope too, but in this world there is no justice for female victims and survivors until now.

n crisis situations - whether it is war, flight or a pandemic - inequalities deepen and violence against women increases. This was also shown in Germany during the Corona lockdown: Many women in a violent situation were stuck at home and had no opportunity to communicate or get support to get out of their situation.

Gender-based violence is defined in conventions and laws as physical, psychological and sexual violence against people because of their gender - in the vast majority of cases it affects girls, women and people read as women. What are the specific actions?
 In principle, it begins with everyday sexism and ends with femicide. Because they all have one thing in common: the perpetrators are mostly men who claim power over women and want to enforce it.

Every woman has experienced sexual harassment, at least verbally, and was then faced with the question: Do I react at all or do I better get away to avoid worse things? This is a situation that men rarely find themselves in. That alone already makes a gender-specific difference, but many are not aware of it - just as little corresponding assaults and criminal offenses.
Of course, the following applies in the legal system: in case of doubt for the accused. A crime must be proven before it can be convicted. But legislation - i.e. the introduction and content design of laws - not only has an effect on their application and enforcement, but also shapes public awareness of right and wrong.

In the end, it's relatively simple: if people learned to treat other people with equal respect regardless of their gender; when men realize: Would I want what I'm doing right now to happen to my girlfriend, my sister, my daughter, my mother? - then a lot would change.",0,0,Event,33172226,0,comment,2022-05-05T07:59:14Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0,[],33172226,33172226,REINSTATE JOHNNY  FOR PIRATES  6,2022-04-28T17:44:07Z,,2022-04-28T17:44:07Z,,en-US,['en'],REINSTATE JOHNNY  FOR PIRATES  6,"<p>  Johnny was unjustly removed from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series.
