Today, I think, it is time.<br>Let's look at what is abuse and talk a little about gender roles. To make it a little clearer. I began to read psychological articles on this topic, and I really did not like one thing! Most articles emphasize that a man is a rapist, a woman is a victim. Absolutely stereotypical thinking in our time, when stereotypes are crumbling everywhere. If we are talking about equality, then not only equality of rights, but also equality of responsibility! And I think Johnny suffers in part from this stereotypical thinking too! And with certain efforts, the \u201cDepp case\u201d could be a precedent for the protection of male victims!<br>Why it happens? Yes, probably men are mostly physically stronger (although not always!). But an abuse (as it is written in those articles) is not only physical violence, but also moral, emotional, psychological ... And this is already the \"power\" of women. Tell me, who better get the brain out?;) The answer is unequivocal, with a few exceptions.<br>In addition, because of these same stereotypes, men find it harder to fight. Potential victims are most likely brought up so that you can not raise a hand against a woman. And if he answer, then what will happen? Public opinion will say \"AAA, he is a scoundrel, he beats women!!!\" And now he find yourself guilty. Secondly, it is difficult to tell someone, complain. They will be called a wimp and a rag. Also so-so pleasure. It remains to endure and be silent, increasingly destroying his personality. Only in a truly equal society should all cases be treated in the same way and everyone should be entitled to protection.</p>\n<p>So what are the signs of an abuse?<br>Constant quibbles to the smallest shortcomings (the fact that ideals do not exist in principle are completely ignored), jealousy, bans on communication with family and friends, total control, humiliation and disrespect for values \u200b\u200band needs (I can, but you don\u2019t). The unpredictability of punishments. It is very difficult to understand what you are doing wrong. From this the feeling of guilt and inferiority is fixed in the victim. And the alternation of periods of violence with periods of peace, when it seems that everything is finally adjusted. And the abuser gives it all as a concern for a partner, so at the beginning of a relationship it can be difficult to figure out where you are. And this is a big danger.<br>(And now look at Amber and her relationship with Johnny, and you will see all this. Google to help). For illustration - one of her fresh photos.

He says, \u201cGrotesquely, the truth is the opposite of their latest \"blacklist allegation\": according to the\u00a0New York Post, \"senior executives at Warner Bros.,\" who are the company\u2019s #Metoo leadership and personally close with Amber Heard, claimed a week ago that Warner Bros. would throw Johnny Depp off the \"Fantastic Beasts\" movie franchise in which he stars because of Ms. Heard\u2019s abuse hoax, notwithstanding that it has been thoroughly disproven by police and other sworn testimony, photographs, audio tape and 87 surveillance videos. Ms. Heard has herself previously been arrested and incarcerated for domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, Mr. Waldman, we really hope so!</p>\n<p>!!!\"These matters will be determined by the Court, not the Hollywood Reporter, nor by People Magazine, whose employee conspired with Ms. Heard to put her hoax on its cover. Mr. Depp will have his days in courts; these lies will never survive the disinfecting sunlight of evidence.\u201d!!!</p>", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "24448177", "createdAt": "2019-04-19T20:00:48.000Z", "signatureCount": 50}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "24438777", "createdAt": "2019-04-17T15:52:55.000Z", "signatureCount": 25}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "24437068", "createdAt": "2019-04-17T07:02:53.000Z", "signatureCount": 10}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "24435854", "createdAt": "2019-04-16T22:27:31.000Z", "signatureCount": 5}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjIz", "hasNextPage": false}}}}}], "count": 2, "cursors": ["", "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjEx"]}
