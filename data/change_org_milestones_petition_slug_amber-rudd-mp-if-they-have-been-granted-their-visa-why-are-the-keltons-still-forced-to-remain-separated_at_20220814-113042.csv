StarterPetitionUpdate,22011679,2017-11-13T22:54:05.000Z,They Fixed It!,"My passport FINALLY arrived back today with my CORRECTED visa attached! Now, why was that so hard? 

Thank you so much to everyone who supported our petition. We hope that our story can STILL be heard and make a difference in the wider story of the deplorable treatment by the home office of families of British citizens-- and so of the British citizen himself-- and that together we might see some policies changed for the better. 

But for now we will just celebrate the end of this particular fight! Charles and I CANNOT WAIT for my flight to land later this week :)

Thank you and God bless!!",,,,
StarterPetitionUpdate,21865834,2017-11-01T04:53:53.000Z,Contact from UKVI,"Today, we have FINALLY received contact from UKVI to move forward with fixing the vignette in my passport so I might rejoin Charles! I am bursting!!!!!!!!! But I'm quite emotional too, because the last time I sent them my passport to put the original vignette in, I didn't see it for 10 weeks...

Please, Oh Lord, when they say they'll do it ""straightaway"" may they actually mean ""straightaway.""

Please keep praying for us. Until I can see and reach out and touch my husband's handsome face, I will continue to live on these eggshells. The anxiety is overwhelming my entire life. 

Please let's keep finding a way to hold the Home Office accountable for the nightmares they are causing people. So many of you have reached out to me since posting this petition to tell me your similar stories, and my heart just aches for each of you. It is unjust and inhumane to force families apart. And it is seemingly going uncorrected by the UK gov't. Why?

Let's keep sharing the petition until UKVI finished the job...

Thank you so so much for all of your support!!
-- Leah & Charles",,,,
