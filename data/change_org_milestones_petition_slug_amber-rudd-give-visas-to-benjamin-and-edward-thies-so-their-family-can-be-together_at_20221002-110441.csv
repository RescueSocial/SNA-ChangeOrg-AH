StarterPetitionUpdate,21084790,2017-08-17T17:42:09.000Z,Victory - visas have been approved!,"Thank you to all 17,172 of you who signed the petition. Gillian and Pat have heard today that the visas have been approved!!

Still a few hurdles to overcome before they can get on a plane back to the UK, but it's just brilliant to have this news.

I really didn't expect this petition to take off in the way that it has - thanks again to everyone who shared and signed - it really helped to put pressure on the Home Office to get this appalling situation sorted.

If you are able to help the family again, another friend has set up a Go Fund Me page to help towards their costs (lawyers, visa fees, flights etc) which have totalled more then Â£20,000.

Thank you!!",,,"{'providerName': 'gofundme.com', 'photoUrl': 'https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/23012836_1502739766.2434.jpg', 'description': 'Hello my name is Shawn Whale and to all, my thanks for giving this your time and consideration.

StarterPetitionUpdate,21055369,2017-08-14T20:58:09.000Z,Update from Gillian,"Monday 14th August: Just heard from Gillian - the Home Office have been in touch to tell her there should be a decision this week. 

But of course that decision could still be a 'no'.

Patrick needs to come back to the UK as his employers (who have been very supportive) need him back at work. So Gillian is planning to fly back to the US with their youngest son later this week to be with the older boys.

So there is progress, but we're not there yet. Let's hope the strength of support for this petition (12,121 and counting!) makes the Home Office see sense and allow this family to be together again.

Thank you again for your support. Gillian's said she's feeling humbled and amazed by all the signatures on the petition. She's been writing a blog with more about their experiences - have a read!",,,"{'providerName': ""Gillian's Immigration NIghtmare (GIN)"", 'photoUrl': 'https://gilliansimigrationnightmare.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cropped-familyphoto1.jpg?w=200', 'description': ""Kings Norton has been around a long time - it was mentioned in Domesday.

I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who has signed my petition in support of my friends Gillian and Patrick Thies and their sons. I'm absolutely amazed by the level of support - more than 6000 signatures so far! Please keep up the support and we can send a really strong message to Home Secretary Amber Rudd.

Thank you all!
