Anita Kanitz, trade unionist
 
""I am harassed, humiliated and threatened every single day just by walking into this courtroom.I get hundreds of death threats on a regular basis, almost every day. Thousands since this process began. People make fun of my statements that I was abused.""
""The disappointment I feel today is beyond words. I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband.""
""I’m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women.
""It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously.""
“I’m sad I lost this case.But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American — to speak freely and openly.”
Amber Heard, actress and victim of sexual, domestic and narcissistic violence and a media witch hunt worldwide
 
The Amber Heard-Johnny Depp trial was an orgy of misogyny! In text messages to friends, Johnny Depp fantasized about murdering his then-wife, the actress Amber Heard. “I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead,” Depp wrote. In other texts, he disparaged his wife’s body in luridly misogynist terms. “Mushy pointless dangling overused floppy fish market,” he called her.The texts became public as part of Depp’s defamation suit against Heard, now at trial in a Virginia court. Ostensibly, Depp is suing over a 2018 article that Heard published in the Washington Post, titled “I spoke up against sexual violence – and faced our culture’s wrath.” In the piece, the actress writes, “Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse.” The article does not mention Depp, but his lawyers say that the piece was about him – and was defamatory. For those 11 words, Depp is seeking 15 millions. Johnny Depp was a drug addict prone to violent rages and a misogynist who assaulted his wife and used abusive language about women, a London court heard in 2020 as the actor’s libel trial against a British tabloid neared its end. By accusing Heard of physically assaulting him, Depp was seeking to reverse the roles of offender and victim.
After the couple split up, Depp set out to destroy Heard. “She’s begging for total global humiliation... She’s gonna get it,” he said in a text to a friend in 2016. “I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of emotion, or what I once thought was love, for this gold digging, low level, dime a dozen, mushy pointless dangling overused flappy fish market.”He also described in very graphic terms an act of violence he would like to commit against someone he called “Mollusk”. The Depp-Heard trial in 2022 shines light on issues of domestic abuse and feminism.
 
The courtroom drama between former spouses Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, in which he is seeking $50 million in damages for her allegations of abuse during their marriage while she is reiterating the accusations and countersuing for $100 million, has been drawing a lot of attention — and not just because it’s a sordid saga involving Hollywood celebrities.
Although it was very obvious in the process who is the perpetrator and who is the victim, Johnny Depp won the process, while Amber Heard's life and career seems destroyed. That is the unbelievable, here the worldwide misogyny showed its ugly face, as in many, many processes where child molesters, women and girls molesters, women and child bullies, women-destroying online haters go unpunished or completely unpunished. Who wants to talk about justice and equality here? To claim that would be a joke based on the shocking facts. A jury in the USA found actor Johnny Depp mostly right in the defamation trial against his ex-wife and colleague Amber Heard on 06/01/22. Heard had accused Depp of abuse and domestic violence - the seven jurors in Fairfax, Virginia found that she defamed him. You must therefore pay $ 10.35 million in damages to Depp. The sum is significantly less than the $ 50 million for which Depp had sued. At the same time, according to the verdict, Depp also has to pay two million dollars to Heard. The jury also agreed on a number of points. Heard counterclaimed Depp's lawsuit, demanding $100 million. Dressed all in black, Heard followed the verdict in court, Depp did not show up. Numerous onlookers and fans, especially Depp, had gathered in front of the court, who cheered after the verdict and shouted ""Johnny, Johnny"". This trial of Heard reminded me of the witch trials of the Middle Ages, men and women screamed burn the witch, even though all these people and witch hunt victims, women, girls, children, a few men, were innocent. Has humanity learned nothing? From my point of view not! The hate that Heard hits, hits all victims, above all, all female people, but that doesn't seem to be clear to many female Depp fans and Depp supporters. Out of stupidity, out of malice, hard to say! This verdict and this trial will brand all future victims as liars, lunatics, abusers, career wreckers, and it hits all victims, female, male, child, thanks to Johnny Depp. We have one man and his crazy fan base to thank for this disaster and as always, the misogynist message doesn't just come from Islamic countries, but from the westernmost country of all, America!
 

For their part, Depp’s fans seem to not so much deny Depp’s alleged violence against Heard, but to approve of it. “He could have killed you,” says one viral Tiktok supporting Depp, the text superimposed over photos of Heard’s bruised face. “He had every right.” The post has more than 222,200 likes.The backlash to #Me Too has long been under way. Critics of the movement painted women’s efforts to end sexual violence as excessive and intemperate from the start, claiming #MeToo had “gone too far” before it really got under way at all. And yet the Heard trial does feel like a tipping point in our culture’s response to gender violence. The forces of misogynist reaction are perhaps even stronger now for having been temporarily repressed. Where once women refused, en masse, to keep men’s secrets, or to remain silent about the truth of their own lives, now, a resurgence of sexism, virulent online harassment, and the threat of lawsuits, all aim to compel women back into silence – by force. What Johnny Depp, his lawyers, lots of media and social media, his so-called friends are doing here is a misogynistic witch hunt and a global slap in the face to all victims of violence, female and male. While the victim is showered with scorn, hatred and threats, the perpetrator is frenetically celebrated as a hero and victim.
Here in Germany we also have an opinion and we see things differently than America, which is obviously incredibly misogynistic. A lot of people who see this are tired of going to America or watching any movies with misogynistic full drug and alcohol addicted narcissistic American male jerks and I mean that seriously. We in Germany are sick of your disgusting witch hunts and misogyny and the day of days is coming when your misdeeds will fall back on you.
I don't think much of America anymore, we're not in the Middle Ages, where innocent people were tortured and burned as witches. So honestly, is it still possible?Can we now herald the end of Metoo after so many people around the world are literally spitting on a victim of violence and hounding them to death. Where is the women's movement in America, where are the human rights of women in America? Likely disappeared in the new witch trial of a woman in America, instigated by a psychopathic narcissist and believe it or not, by millions of female and male supporters, including courts and attorneys. And in the 21st century, to say most normal people are pissed off here is an understatement.
It's a lesson in misogyny: the hate campaign against Amber Heard. There are a lot of things happening in the world right now that demand our attention and outrage. A multi-billionaire who presents himself as an icon of ""free speech"" wants to silence a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment. Global warming has reached a point of no return, but serious environmental protection is just a little too uncomfortable for the super-rich and industrialized nations. In the United States, killing sprees and terrorist attacks are now happening every week. And then there is the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, which has meanwhile joined the misery that we have learned to accept with a shrug of the shoulders.
However, when it comes to Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, all of this news seems secondary. The eye of the online public is on the court case between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, which is currently taking place in Fairfax, Virginia. The background can actually be told quickly: Amber Heard published a feminist article in the Washington Post in December 2018, in which she wrote, among other things: “Two years ago I became a public figure representing domestic violence; and I felt the full brunt of our culture's hatred of women speaking out publicly.” Heard had split from her husband Johnny Depp at the time; the split came with a domestic violence restraining order and she was photographed with bruises on her face.
The British tabloid ""Sun"" described Johnny Depp as a ""wife beater"". The Hollywood star went to court in 2020 - and has now suffered a deserved defeat there. The judge in charge ruled that the information in the text of the Sun was ""essentially true"". That's why Depp's lawsuit was dismissed.
Do you think this man would finally have calmed down? If all violent, controlling and raping men are now allowed to sue their victims, where are we going? Nobody thought of that among the women who support Depp because of his supposed good looks and his charm, and also like his ex-wives out of cowardice. Powerful men and men in general are always right, who is going to report a perpetrator anymore? In this way, female, male and child victims are silenced by perpetrators. Female betrayal is evident in two of Johnny Depp's ex-girlfriends who also broke up with him, have been called cunts by him and now claim he was a wonderful man. Honestly, I would like to see into the brains of the ladies, did they get so much money from him that they say something like this, even though they know full well that the trial is against all victims, not just against Amber Heard. If Heard loses, we all lose and Metoo is a thing of the past!
I can't hear these constant victim accusations and non-stop abuser apologies anymore. If you think only men blame female victims, think again. Often the women with accusations are even more extreme and insulting. Who hasn't had that happen to you, you become a victim of catcalling on the street, other women say, my God you're sensitive, you just don't listen. Or your classmate, colleague, boss sexually harassed you, many women scream right away, honestly, you didn't provoke them, men don't do it for no reason. A female relative is beaten up badly by her husband, often with children, most women scream right away, yes, this woman deserves it, she and her children must be cheeky. A female friend is gang raped, female sympathy, non-existent, they say, honestly, doesn't she look like a slut and doesn't she deserve it? A woman is being stalked, women are immediately screaming in chorus, yes, you must have had an affair with the guy, it's your own fault, otherwise he wouldn't be so fixated on you... And so on and so on...
Together women are strong. Together we make a change. Together we triumph!
If you are a survivor of sexual and domestic violence, rape and abuse, psychic terror and sadistic stalking, be proud of yourself. Because you have survived, in spite of everything, with all your courage, strength and bravery.
If sexual and domestic violence, sexual slavery, rape and domestic homicide and sex murder continue to be trivialized worldwide and remain almost unpunished, we need not be surprised that women, girls, female children and female babies around the world are experiencing a global cruel genocide. A female holocaust that threatens the future of humanity: Sexual and domestic crimes, murders and femicide must punished with the strictest penalties in the world, otherwise one day there will be no more women in the world and that will be very soon!
Don't tell women, girls and female childs how to dress and look beautiful. It's more important to tell them to learn to defend themselves and to fight. The day may come, that this saves their lives. Self defense is a human right and human rights are women right's.
The emergence of the #MeToo movementin the aftermath of the scandals surrounding movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and television personalities Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly has led to a rise in public scrutiny over the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements in settlements. These agreements can be incredibly pernicious contracts when they are used to silence sexual abuse. Allowing victims to speak out is a necessary form of prevention because it exposes the pattern of abuse, warns those who might become victims, and encourages others similarly situated to come forward with their own claims.
The silence, secrecy and shame that surrounds victims and survivors of child sexual assault are the
offender’s best friend and our children’s worst enemy. Silence and secrecy are always the facilitator,
rarely the solution. Criminalising a victim/survivor’s right to speak out and break their silence, to
identify themselves as a victim of sexual harm not only perpetuates the harm, disempowerment and fear
experienced by survivors but it is a breach of the their human rights. This response can cause just as
much harm as the offending itself. Victims of sexual assault have had so much taken from them by the
offender, to then have a system further strip them of their rights to have a voice, to share their story
without shame, to regain control of their lives, can have serious unintended adverse impacts.
Our demand worldwide must be:
Perpetrators of abuse are held accountable!
They are not to retain positions of power or authority, they must demonstrate they are able to function without perpetuating abuse, rape, coercive or controlling behaviours.
Victim-Survivors of rape and sexual violence must be supported and not held responsible for the behaviours of rapists, predators and abusers.
Victim surviours should have the right to speak out about their sexual assault and rape without fear of legal repuccusion.
The ever growing momentum behind feminist movements has encouraged women to speak up and demand for equal rights. This progress should not go unrecognised, as women are beginning to receive more opportunities, respect, protection and empowerment. However, one ongoing oppressive tendency includes the silencing of women.
I believe that the endless silencing of women can be explained by assessing the structure of society. The capitalist and patriarchal society, which can be found all around the globe, depends on women remaining silent in order for its existence. When women remain silent, society can be complicit and oppression can continue.
I'm a trade unionist and women's rights activist and I know what I'm talking about. I was also tried to be silenced online, with defamation and hate campaigns, sexual deepfakes, identity theft and hacker attacks, with threats of murder and rape online. But I won't keep quiet, because if we keep quiet, the perpetrators won. Of course it's dangerous. Life in the womb is already dangerous for female people, because how many female fetuses are aborted worldwide, isn't it? If we don't fight back, we've already lost.
We must say enough. It’s time to End the Silence on Sexual and Gender Based  Violence.
-Anita Kanitz, trade unionist
 
“over and over victims are blamed for their assaults. and when we imply that victims bring on their own fates - whether to make ourselves feel more efficacious or to make the world seem just - we prevent ourselves from taking the necessary precautions to protect ourselves. Why take precautions? We deny the trauma could easily have happened to us. And we also hurt the people already traumatized. Victims are often already full of self-doubt, and we make recovery harder by laying inspectors blame on them.”
― Anna C. Salter, Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, And Other Sex Offenders
“From New Delhi to New York, from Durban to Rio; women and
girls are been hunted down by rapists, abused by pedophiles and
emotionally decapitated by a society that is becoming increasingly
hostile to the womenfolk”

There are many crimes against women, girls and female childs: Domestic and sexual violence, street harassment, workplace harassment, catcalling, Eve teasing, taharrush gamea, rape culture, mass and gang rapes, war rapes, child rapes, marital rapes, dowry murder, forced and child marriages, FGM, sex slavery, women, girls and child trafficking, forced prostitution, rape pornography, online harassment, sadistic stalking, domestic and sexual murder, acid attacks, femicide, female infanticide, daily hate speech and sexism, sadistic and forced sexual practices, lack of freedom, education and human rights, forced dress codes like chador and burqa, victim blaming of assault, stalking, bullying and rape victims,witch hunts, widow murders, executions like stoning for rape and assault victims, imprisonment and punishment of female victims..
Violence against women, girls and female childs - particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence - are major public health problems and violations of women's human rights and childrens rights..
Recent global prevalence figures indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.
Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (30%) of women who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.
Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.
Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health, and may increase vulnerability to HIV.
Factors associated with increased risk of perpetration of violence include low education, child maltreatment or exposure to violence in the family, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality.
Factors associated with increased risk of experiencing intimate partner and sexual violence include low education, exposure to violence between parents, abuse during childhood, attitudes accepting violence and gender inequality.
There is evidence from high-income settings that school-based programmes may be effective in preventing relationship violence (or dating violence) among young people.
In low-income settings, primary prevention strategies, such as microfinance combined with gender equality training and community-based initiatives that address gender inequality and relationship skills, hold promise.
Situations of conflict, post conflict and displacement may exacerbate existing violence, such as by intimate partners, and present additional forms of violence against women.
Global violence uniquely affects the girl child. Although international legal instruments have been in place for decades to protect the girl child, thousands of brutal acts of violence and neglect specifically targeting the girl child can be observed around the world on a daily basis. For centuries, girls who have barely attained adolescence have been forced into marriage, often with men many years their senior. As a minor, a girl child cannot legally give her consent to enter into such a partnership. They have suffered in female genital mutilation rituals. They are traded, bought, and sold across national borders as commodities to be put to use as prostitutes or slaves, or merely to be sold again at a profit. Many girls are even victimized before birth, as technology and greater access to medicine have given rise to prenatal sex selection and selection abortion based on sex. Girls continue to face the threat of sexual harassment and abuse in workplaces and schools. Their lives may be taken for the “honor” of their families for speaking to strangers or committing other minor transgressions. Violence against the girl child has become a powerful and all-too-common tactic in times of war and humanitarian disaster.
 That is the reason why I am fighting my whole life for human rights, women and girls rights and children's rights. But it is not enough, day by day the world is getting a more dangerous and barbaric place for childs, girls and women! And the greatest danger on earth for all of us are the male humans, what a shame for humankind!
Femicide, misogyny, stalking, sexual violence, rape culture, hate speech is everywhere!
We don't want to use the term ‘harassment.’ What is happening today is sexual terrorism.
A strong woman stands up for herself. A stronger woman stands up for everyone else.

“Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It shouldn’t be that women are the exception.”
“Every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is, although we didn’t have a name for it.”
“Feminism is the notion that we should each be free to develop our own talents and not be held back by man made barriers.”
-Ruth Ginsburg,  American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in 2020.
 
We are living in a world with extreme misogyny, sexism, rape culture and violence against women, girls, female childs and babies.There are hate crimes like femicide, female infanticide, cruel rapes, gang rapes, mass rapes, war rapes ,child rapes, marital rape, heinous rape porns, child porns, forced prostitution, sex slavery, dowry murder, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, sexual and domestic violence, acid attacks, honour killings, sexual murder, sexual torture, witch hunts, widow murder, human trafficking, abduction connected with rape, torture, forced marriages, murder, religous persecution of women, girls and female childs like in the Islam and the Hinduism,street harassment, workplace and school harassment, online harassment, cyber bullying, cruel punishments for female victims like stoning, lashing, inprisonment, sadistic stalking, lack of human rights, contraception and education, forced and sexist dress codes, hate speech in the society, the media and the religion, violence during childbirths.
Domestic, sexual violence, rape, stalking are the names for hatred of women and contempt for women. It is not a new problem, it is an old problem, as in the media daily is shown with many cases and examples, of childhood harassment, school harassment, workplace harassment, gang rapes, sexual harassment and sexual murder, femicide, FGM, child and forced marriages,dowry murder and witch hunts on the social media and so and so on.
Sexual violence is male. Every day the media confronts us with reports of ""normal"" sexual harassment, rape or even sexual killings. What are the underlying causes of this behavior? It is known that these forms of violence are based on an ambivalent to hostile attitude towards women, which can be demonstrated as a tendency in almost all men. Femininity is unconsciously perceived by men as a threat and therefore warded off and that sexual acts of violence are to be interpreted exclusively as an expression of male power and ignore the sexuality of men, because what is decisive is not only the instinctual basis of sexuality and aggression, but their attachment to the common Object: the woman. The typically male willingness to use violence arises from an unconscious attitude to femininity determined by lust, fear, envy, anger and hate. This becomes extremely visible in group rapes, mass rapes, rapes in war zones, sexual mob crimes, forced prostitution, child prostitution, sex slavery, honor killings, FGM, child marriages, forced marriages, witch hunts, dowry murder, acid attacks, stoning and lashing of female victims, widow murder, child rape, child sex slavery, sadistic misogynist pornography.
And the worst thing worldwide is victim blaming:
I can't hear these constant victim accusations and non-stop abuser apologies anymore. If you think only men blame female victims, think again. Often the women with accusations are even more extreme and insulting. Who hasn't had that happen to you, you become a victim of catcalling on the street, other women say, my God you're sensitive, you just don't listen. Or your classmate, colleague, boss sexually harassed you, many women scream right away, honestly, you didn't provoke them, men don't do it for no reason. A female relative is beaten up badly by her husband, often with children, most women scream right away, yes, this woman deserves it, she and her children must be cheeky. A female friend is gang raped, female sympathy, non-existent, they say, honestly, doesn't she look like a slut and doesn't she deserve it? A woman is being stalked, women are immediately screaming in chorus, yes, you must have had an affair with the guy, it's your own fault, otherwise he wouldn't be so fixated on you... And so on and so on..
End this nonsence  and this hate against women, girls and female childs forever, that is a shame for the whole male humankind and in the future when Herstory is written, the humans in the future can read about the crimes and the shame of the male human apes.

There is no proof that he ever abused women sexually or otherwise! He has only been judged by the court of public opinion. HE HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED FOR HURTING ANYONE and he has been subjected to outrageous attempts of extortion, by liars who conspire to ruin his life. And, yes, EVAN RACHEL WOOD is best friends with AMBER HEARD! It is no coincidence that Manson is being lynched by the #metoo mob, as Johnny Depp has been. Sign this, and other petitions, and share them, to save his videos from removal! <br><br>REMEMBER:</p>
<p>1. Evan Rachel Wood fully consented to the love making in this video. <br><br></p>
<p>2. There were multiple witnesses there, who saw that Manson did nothing against her will. </p>
