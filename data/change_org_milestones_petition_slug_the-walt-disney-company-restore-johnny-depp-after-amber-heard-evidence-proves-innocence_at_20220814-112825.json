It's a myth to say, as Mr. Depp apparently is implying that, if Ms. Heard slapped him, then she can't also be a victim. That is just not true.\"</p>\n<p>The argument that he was violent too might fly, except that the whole crux of her argument on the recording, the reason for the fight de jour, is that he always leaves (\"splits\") whenever she starts a physical altercation with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can't have it both ways, hon. You can't accuse him of abuse, but get caught on tape calling him a baby and a coward for leaving whenever you get physically violent with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This reaction doesn't fly any more than the rest of her flimsy accusations. Time's up for Amber, and she's apparent'y the only one that doesn't know it, still trying desperately to seem socially relevant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts about this?</p>", "photo": {"id": "223076526", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/3/nb/op/svNBOPTsMLSPsBM-800x450-noPad.jpg?1580941913", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "25706887", "createdAt": "2020-02-05T17:55:45.000Z", "signatureCount": 25}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "25701896", "createdAt": "2020-02-04T20:58:28.000Z", "signatureCount": 10}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "25701253", "createdAt": "2020-02-04T18:49:37.000Z", "signatureCount": 5}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjU=", "hasNextPage": false}}}}}], "count": 1, "cursors": [""]}
