StarterPetitionUpdate,29291880,2021-07-04T16:45:38.000Z,,I Won’t Stop on my Mission~But I Need Your Help!,"<p>Happy 4th of July to all of my Supporters </p>
<p>I am humbled by my 414 co-signers and to all who’ve amplified my message to Congress.</p>
<p> I won’t &amp; can’t stop! As a Veteran my oath to the Constitution and the American people never expires.</p>
<p> I continue to try and get media coverage for my petition as well as a face to face meeting with my Democratic Senators to push them on the For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>This is even more urgent after failed Senate vote and the Supreme Court ruling last week that further weakened the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>We need a filibuster carve out for democracy because certainly the right of all Americans to vote is as important as budgets, cabinet picks and judges. Voting is a constitutional right that must be protected at all costs!</p>
<p>Can you please take a moment to share my petition on all of your platforms so I can meet the next 500 signature goal, to let the media and Congress know how serious we are!</p>
<p> Thank you &amp; Happy 4th of July </p>

StarterPetitionUpdate,29259460,2021-06-26T15:05:31.000Z,,Help me make some Major Noise,"<p>Good Morning Fellow Voting Rights Defenders, <br>To everyone that has helped me with my petition, my eternal thanks </p>
<p>Throughout my Marine Corps career I never could have imagined that I would see our democracy under assault by fellow Americans. I served for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, gender, age or political affiliation, and the right to vote is the very bedrock of our democracy.</p>
<p>Now that I have 280 co-signers my plan is to get further attention so the voice of Veteran’s, who served, sacrificed and died for the rights under assault can be heard in the halls of Congress.</p>
<p>I have reached out to news outlets and to have a face-to-face meeting with my Senators while they are home on break.</p>
<p>The more co-signers I have the better my chances. Can you please help one more time and share with your friends across your social media platforms and elsewhere. Because United we stand!!!</p>
<p> Thank you </p>
