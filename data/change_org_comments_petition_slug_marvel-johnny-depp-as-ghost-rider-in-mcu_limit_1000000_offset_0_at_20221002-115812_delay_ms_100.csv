Shocking Domestic Violence Statistics That Remind Us It’s An Epidemic!
For example the U.S.:

The number of American troops killed in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001 and 2012 was 6,488. The number of American women who were murdered by current or ex male partners during that time was 11,766. That’s nearly double the amount of casualties lost during war.

Women are much more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence with 85 percent of domestic abuse victims being women and 15 percent men. Too many women have been held captive by domestic violence — whether through physical abuse, financial abuse, emotional abuse or a combination of all three.

We are inundated with news stories about domestic violence , from athletes beating their significant others in public elevators or in their own homes to celebrities publicly abusing their girlfriends. This problem is not one that will go away quickly or quietly.

As Domestic Violence Awareness Month comes to an end, discussions about intimate partner abuse and its horrible repercussions should not. In an attempt to illustrate the gravity of abuse all genders (but largely women) face in the U.S., we rounded up 30 statistics on domestic violence.

Domestic violence is not a singular incident, it’s an insidious problem deeply rooted in our culture — and these numbers prove that.

No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us /Rachel Louise Snyder (Autor)
We call it domestic violence. We call it private violence. Sometimes we call it intimate terrorism. But whatever we call it, we generally do not believe it has anything at all to do with us, despite the World Health Organization deeming it a “global epidemic.” In America, domestic violence accounts for 15 percent of all violent crime, and yet it remains locked in silence, even as its tendrils reach unseen into so many of our most pressing national issues, from our economy to our education system, from mass shootings to mass incarceration to #MeToo. We still have not taken the true measure of this problem.

In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder gives context for what we don't know we're seeing. She frames this urgent and immersive account of the scale of domestic violence in our country around key stories that explode the common myths-that if things were bad enough, victims would just leave; that a violent person cannot become nonviolent; that shelter is an adequate response; and most insidiously that violence inside the home is a private matter, sealed from the public sphere and disconnected from other forms of violence. Through the stories of victims, perpetrators, law enforcement, and reform movements from across the country, Snyder explores the real roots of private violence, its far-reaching consequences for society, and what it will take to truly address it.

On the Front Line with the Women Who Fight Back/Stacey Dooley (Autor)
Over her ten years of documentary film making, Stacey Dooley has covered a wide variety of topics, from sex trafficking in Cambodia to Yazidi women fighting back in Syria.

At the heart of all her reporting are incredible women in extraordinary situations: sex workers in Russia, victims of domestic violence in Honduras, and many more.

Mummy’s Little Angels: A mother’s agonising story of losing her sons to a murderous father/ Denise Williams (Autor)
Losing a child is a mother’s worst nightmare, but when you lose two children – your innocent sons – at the hands of the man they should have trusted the most, it’s almost unimaginable.

For Denise Williams this was her reality – her very real nightmare. In her harrowing yet inspiring memoir, she tells her personal story of falling under the spell of her control-freak husband, suffering a decade of domestic violence, finding the strength to leave and then his despicable act of revenge. Denise endured agonising grief and heavy guilt, but she has slowly rebuilt her life without her beautiful boys – learning to live, love and trust again.

This is her heartbreaking memoir.

Brave: How I rebuilt my life after love turned to hate/Adele Bellis (Autor)
Control. Jealousy. Isolation. Blame. Anger. Violence.
The inspiring true story of a young woman who suffered a terrifyingly abusive relationship culminating in a horrific acid attack from the man who claimed to love her.

Adele was just 23 years old when she was scarred for life by an acid attack arranged by her ex-boyfriend, Anthony. The attack left her partially bald and she lost her right ear. This was Anthony’s attempt to stop her from ever being attractive to another man – a final act of ‘control’ over her and the horrific end to a terrifying case of domestic abuse.

The acid attack came after she had ended her relationship of several years with Anthony Riley, the man who said he couldn’t live without her. Anthony Riley was convicted in October 2015 and was sentenced to a minimum of 13 years in prison.

This is Adele’s brave story, the story of one woman’s incredible fight to recover from the most appalling injuries and to decide that she would not be controlled, she would be strong.

Playing Dead: A Memoir of Terror and Survival /Monique Faison Ross (Autor)
This domestic abuse survivor’s memoir shares an “engaging, powerful, and ultimately shocking story"" of a bad marriage that ended in attempted murder (Lundy Bancroft, author of The Joyous Recovery).
 
Monique Faison, the daughter of San Diego Charger’s football great Earl Faison, married her high school sweetheart soon after she discovered she was pregnant with his child. Her relationship with Chris had always been shaky, but his verbal abuse only increased—and then gave way to physical attacks. Eventually, Monique took their children and left. That was when the stalking and serious threats began.
 
Nothing stopped him—not protection injunctions, police warnings, or even arrests. One fateful Monday morning, Chris kidnapped Monique in front of her children. After a nightmarish car ride that involved car crashes and rape, Chris beat her on the head with a shovel and abandoned her brutalized body in the woods, presuming she was dead. But playing dead was what saved her life.

A Light In Dark Places/ Emily Clawson (Autor), Jennifer Graves (Autor)
In December, 2009, Susan Cox Powell was reported missing from her home in West Valley City, Utah. As law enforcement tried to piece together what had happened to Susan, her husband, Josh Powell, became the only person of interest in the case.
For Jennifer Graves, Josh’s sister, the nightmare started long before Susan’s disappearance. From her experiences growing up in the Powell family to the terrifying moment when she first started to believe her brother was a killer, she relied on her faith to stay strong. She devoted herself to the safety of Susan’s boys, Charlie and Braden, whom she hoped to be able to raise as her own. When the boys were murdered by their father in February, 2012, Jennifer was more than devastated, but she had to believe there was a reason for it all---including the deaths of her beloved nephews.
In A Light In Dark Places, Jennifer shares her struggles and her triumphs. In coming to terms with such tragedy she finally was able to embrace the truth that we all have the power to choose our own path---and there is always hope, no matter how dark things may seem.",0,0,Event,20201430,0,comment,2020-07-22T06:51:51Z,,8090682,8090682,Anita,Kanitz,Anita,Anita Kanitz,Stuttgart,,DE,,de-DE,,[],20201430,20201430,Johnny Depp as Ghost Rider in MCU,2020-02-07T10:48:04Z,,2020-02-07T10:49:38Z,,en-IN,['en'],Marvel: Johnny Depp as Ghost Rider in MCU,"<p>I love Ghost Rider ever since I read it.

Marvel is one of the biggest names in Hollywood right now and if Depp is hired as the iconic Ghost Rider, Marvel would get yet another incredible actor on board and this would prove such a positive step in Depp's redeeming career. </p>",Marvel,Johnny Depp as Ghost Rider in MCU,2021-02-07,,,PK,,,,,,,marvel-johnny-depp-as-ghost-rider-in-mcu,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 476601, 'locale': 'en-IN', 'name': 'Other', 'slug': 'other-en-in', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 23267}]",True,False,,34,34,0,290,17,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,,223083055,photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-400x400-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-400x225-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-800x450-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,1600,900,photo,1,1654676307.947,1,1640766611.183,1041662033,1041662033,Waqas,Irfan,Waqas,Waqas Irfan,,,PK,,en-IN,,223083059,photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-48x48-noPad.jpg?1581072554,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-128x128-noPad.jpg?1581072554,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-400x400-noPad.jpg?1581072555,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-800x800-noPad.jpg?1581072556,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 49204, 'display_name': 'Marvel', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'marvel-19', 'description': '', 'publicly_visible': True, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': '2016-08-04T18:39:10Z', 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Marvel', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 28195}, 'has_email': False, 'photo': {'id': 146278517, 'url': 'photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-fullsize.jpg', 'sizes': {'small': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-48x48-noPad.jpg?1529271801', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 48, 'height': 48}}, 'medium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-128x128-noPad.jpg?1529271800', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 128, 'height': 128}}, 'large': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-400x400-noPad.jpg?1529271800', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 400, 'height': 400}}, 'xlarge': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-800x800-noPad.jpg?1529271800', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 800, 'height': 800}}}}}]",False,False,False,Waqas Irfan,223083059,photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-48x48-noPad.jpg?1581072554,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-128x128-noPad.jpg?1581072554,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-400x400-noPad.jpg?1581072555,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/bs/eg/uYBSeGDJBevcVoF-800x800-noPad.jpg?1581072556,False,800,800,Marvel: Johnny Depp as Ghost Rider in MCU,Marvel: Johnny Depp as Ghost Rider in MCU,active,100,223083055,photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-400x400-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-400x225-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-800x450-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/uu/ix/LqUUiXzgmExmYiy-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1581072486,False,1600,900,photo,49204,Marvel,,Custom,marvel-19,,True,,,en-US,2016-08-04T18:39:10Z,True,Marvel,,,28195,False,146278517,photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-48x48-noPad.jpg?1529271801,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-128x128-noPad.jpg?1529271800,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-400x400-noPad.jpg?1529271800,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/4/en/jl/smenJLPdzoIggAu-800x800-noPad.jpg?1529271800,False,800,800,34,8419438.0,photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-48x48-noPad.jpg?1518776370,False,48.0,48.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-128x128-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,128.0,128.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,400.0,400.0,//assets.change.org/photos/8/ve/vu/QuveVuBzKPOEulq-800x800-noPad.jpg?1518776892,False,800.0,800.0
