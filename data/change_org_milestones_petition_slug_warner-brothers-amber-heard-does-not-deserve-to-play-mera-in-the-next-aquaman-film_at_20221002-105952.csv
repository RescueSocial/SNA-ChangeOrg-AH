StarterPetitionUpdate,28135129,2020-11-28T08:32:05.000Z,,26k supporters!!! Let’s keep it going!,"<p>Wow guys. I had no idea the petition increased so much! Thanks for the support! The fight is far from over though. I’m sure many of you have heard that Warner has decided to keep Amber as Mera. We cannot, and WILL NOT stand for this. Johnny not only lost his job as Captain Jack Sparrow, but as of recently lost his place as Gellert Grindelwald. She has continued to affect Johnny and his career. It’s wrong, and cannot be tolerated. The evidence is clear. So let’s continue to pursue and make our voices heard! Thank you! </p>",,,

As I said before, we need to be the voices, and make ourselves heard. Amber Heard should not be an exception when it comes to abuse. So keep it up, and let’s make this petition even bigger! </p>",,,

I know there’s another petition regarding this situation, but feel that in having 2 will speak MAJOR volumes as to how serious we are about having Amber Heard removed from the DCEU. </p>",,,
