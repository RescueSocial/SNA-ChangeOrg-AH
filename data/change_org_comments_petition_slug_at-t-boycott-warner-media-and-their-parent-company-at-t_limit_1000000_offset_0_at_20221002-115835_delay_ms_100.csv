It's hard to be told to lighten up because if you lighten up any more, you're going to float the fuck away. The problem is not that one of these things is happening; it's that they are all happening, concurrently and constantly.”

""You probably also know the kind of women who are academically educated, professionally highly qualified and want to make you believe that we women have completely equal rights and are much smarter than men. Who has problems with equal rights, yes, to whom happnes something like domestic, sexual, narcissistic violence, rape, sexual harassment at university and at work, then is something wrong with women and girls. These academic women will never stand up for women's, girls' and children's rights and they will also sign not petition against child and forced marriages, FGM, honor killings and dowry killings , acid attacks, domestic and sexual murders, forced prostitution or wartime rapes, because from their point of view these are isolated cases, cultural and religious ruptures, regrettable incidents and mostly  you can hear the unanimous chorus of the allegedly educated women, the fault of the victims themselves. Because whoever wants to have equal rights and behaves wisely, something like that  is so clever, that such a horror won't happen to her.
Honestly, this kind of females must have the Stockholm Syndrome, what's wrong with our supposedly educated upper class women?
Every year on March 8th is International Women's Day - also called feminist struggle day. This day has been repeated for more than 100 years. In Berlin it is even an official holiday! But a holiday in the name of women!? Yes, unfortunately this is still needed! Because there is still a lot to do before women and men finally have equal rights at work, in the media or in private life.
It is therefore important that you not only stand up for women and girls and more equality on International Women's Day, but also beyond that. You can change something by becoming a feminist and doing something for equality!
And the sad fact is: We can't believe it ourselves! Unfortunately, not all people are equal even in the 21st century. The sad truth is that women and girls are still disadvantaged - also in Germany. According to the Federal Agency for Civic Education, for example, they suffer more often from poverty, hunger and poorer pay. In fact, during the pandemic, gender inequalities have increased as women still do most of the care work. In order for something to change in the situation of women and girls, we have to raise our voices!
If we don't have the courage to stand up for ourselves worldwide, who will?
-Anita Kanitz, trade unionist, publishing clerk, women's, children's and human rights activist

The Social media is like a mirror around the world. Cyberviolence and Cybermisogyny is an increasing problem worldwide and is often gender-based and targeting women and girls. I can talk a long story about that, because I am a cyberstalking survivor too.
Violence against women including in online environment can take many forms, cyberharassment, revenge porn and threats of rape, sexual assault or murder. Perpetrators can be partners or ex-partners, colleagues, schoolmates or, as is often the case, anonymous individuals. Online violence against women increasingly targets female journalists, women rights activists having an impact on their personal and professional life as well as on the public’s right to seek information. On the other hand, perpetrators of online attacks often bear no consequences. Patrick Penninckx, Head of Information Society Department at the Council of Europe, recalls the importance of implementing available instruments and urges to continue working on this subject.
Some women are particularly exposed, such as women’s rights defenders, journalists, bloggers, video gamers, public figures and politicians.
Predominantly, root cause of violence against women and girls is gender inequality (discrimination, gender stereotypes, sexism). Moreover, women who have more than one commonly-targeted characteristic – for example, women of color, members of minority religions, or people who identify as LGBTQ – may be attacked more frequently.
Chilling effect that cyberviolence has on women: Violence and abuse online may limit women’s right to express themselves equally, freely and without fear, women are often silenced. In many instances the impact on victims that experienced online abuse or harassment is major such as lower self-esteem or loss of self-confidence as a result to stress, anxiety or panic attacks after experiencing online abuse or harassment.
Cyberviolence affects women disproportionately not only causing them psychological harm and suffering but also deterring them from digital participation in political, social and cultural life. Cyberviolence hampers the full realisation of gender equality and violates women’s rights.
 
Don't let the bastards win! Hate, bullying, threats, insults, defamation, deep fakes, hacker attacks, online identity thefts, cybermisogyny, cyberflashing, online harassment, cyberstalking, male mob harassment on women and girls online,  on the internet are not private matters. These are particularly disgusting crimes on the Internet, mostly aimed at girls and women, affecting all social classes, social networks, and all countries. It hits celebrity and non-celebrity women and girls. It meets women's rights activists, politicians, journalists, actresses, singers and the women and girls next door. 80 percent of hate messages online are directed at women. Victims often fall on deaf ears. In serious cases, the platform operators will give out the user data at the request of the public prosecutor. For example, in the case of a death threat including publication of the address, a request on Facebook could then be successful. Unfortunately, it is very arbitrary when the platforms help with the investigation - and when not. If they don't help, the police do what is known as open source research. Those who look: What can be inferred from the perpetrator's user profile? Is there anything else you can find out with Google? Of course, the police have a few more options than a private individual. For example, you can query the owner if a license plate number appears in a photo. But the question is always whether the police make this effort. The public insult and threats against women is not a private faux pas. For example, if I'm sitting in Stuttgart and being sexually insulted by a troll in Melbourne, thousands of people can read along. And then it might spread out into closed groups where I no longer have any control over it at all. And this misogyny not only affects those who are defamed or threatened, but everyone who reads along. And if no punishment follows, the perpetrators feel empowered – and the victims intimidated.
 
It is well known that almost every second woman no longer dares to comment on political issues online. So it's about time that authorities and politicians finally understood that this so-called private violence also has a societal dimension. In addition, there is a “manual for media guerrillas” with downright instructions for digital misogyny. This handbook, circulating in far-right circles, explains the best ways to bully and intimidate people online. One tip, for example, is to always have a large repertoire of insults ready. This shows that insults were so rarely prosecuted in the past that they are no longer perceived as a criminal offense. Second tip: women are described as particularly suitable victims because they are particularly easy to intimidate and muzzle. One form of digital violence that almost exclusively affects women is pornographic violence: for example, the head of a real woman is mounted on the body of a porn actress. Such a forgery could be punished as an insult or slander, for example, because the woman is degraded. Or it can be a violation of the right to one's own image. Of course, these are very blunt swords. And that unfortunately makes it very easy for the law enforcement authorities to drop such a case. In the prosecution of this so-called ""image-based sexual violence"" we see a major deficit in the legislature. Especially since these pictures often end up in porn portals and keep reappearing. There's a scene there of men who call themselves ""slut exposers"" who keep uploading pictures like this because they enjoy exposing women. Naked on the net - without knowing it? That can happen with deepfakes. Videos and photos produced by artificial intelligence are flooding the internet. They're getting easier and easier to make. Initially, actresses and pop stars were the victims. Now it can happen to any woman - with nude pictures and porn. In the analog age, there were joke pens with photos of women in the sleeve for horny office guys. If you turned the pen over, the woman was undressed. What was not funny back then has now reached an alarming dimension. It's called: Deepfake. The term is made up of the English words ""deep learning"" and ""fake"" - i.e. machine learning with artificial intelligence and fake. The result is software that creates deceptively real-looking photos and videos, for example by placing Ms. X's head on Ms. Y's. A clothed person in a photo can also simply be stripped naked. The victims of photo and video deepfakes are mostly women.
 
What only a few years ago required huge amounts of data and special software, today an app is sufficient. For the Chinese app ""Zao"", for example, a single portrait photo is enough to cut a person's face into video clips, including porn scenes, of course. The Dutch company Deeptrace examined around 15,000 deepfake videos last year. The result: 96 percent of the films were pornography - in most cases the heads of Hollywood actresses or pop singers were mounted in porn in a deceptively real way. A popular victim: Feminist Emma Watson. That's particularly cool, because she's not only a woman, but also a feminist. But pretty much every actress and singer that's trending right now appears in several of these videos. From Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift to Kristen Stewart. But it doesn't just affect stars, it can affect any woman. With the ""deepfake revenge porn"" a separate genre has now emerged. Ex-girlfriend's face is made into a porn and sent to friends. Women are often even blackmailed with it. For example, by sending it to the woman's parents or to employers, according to Deeptrace. Facebook checks 55,000 of these “revenge porn” a month. For example, the messenger service Telegram, which uses a bot to convert photos of women into nudes, has fallen into disrepute. The program was even specially designed for women's bodies. In order to generate a nude picture, the perpetrators send photos of their victims to a program via Telegram. After a short time they get back the photo manipulated into a nude picture. So far, more than 100,000 AI-generated nude pictures have been created on Telegram and shared in dubious channels. In the Arab world, women have already been blackmailed with it. These photos are also gladly sent to parents and employers, And the judiciary? Once again she can't keep up! But there is another way. Australia has made it illegal to make deepfakes. Since 2018, perpetrators have been imprisoned there for several years. Where there is a will, there is a way. But there is another type of hate crime on the internet, as we are now finding out in 2022, in the 21st century, that shows women and girls are miles away from equality and human rights around the world.
 
I have also been a victim of sexual cyber harassment, cyberstalking, online defamation and deep fakes for 18 years by a psychopathic and dangerous Islamist Australian ex-renter and his misogynist friends, Adis Fazlic, now Melbourne, so he had told at the end of rent time my husband( I hope very much that this great wanker and  all his  biggest assholes on earth are on places where the pepper grows, believe me).
The ex-tenant proved difficult at the time. He paid the rent in cash if he wanted to, and then late at night, and even rang the bell for us to get out of bed. We had reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had sexually abused his then short-term girlfriend and a young tenant with a small daughter. In addition, mail disappeared, we were bombarded with sadistic pornography by fax and e-mail, and he had visits at night from sinister young men, clearly Islamists from our point of view. We've been renting for a very long time (40 years in total now), but we've never had such a creepy man in the house. The terror began during the rental period and even more so afterwards. He set a whole internet mob on us and obviously also Muslims from the area.
After rent disputes and the tenant moving out in 2004, I was able to enjoy the usual stalking incidents damn fast: telephone terror, group stalking, group harassment, lurking professionally and privately, break-in attempts and break-ins, privately, professionally, on vacation and health resort, property damage, then mail and faxes, that Relatives have died, floods of sadistic porn mails, vulgar sex offers, even the famous penis pics with a circumcised penis, harassment of my female friends at home and abroad, on the Internet, through property damage, telephone harassment, break-ins, I also got alleged revenge porn of his Alleged female friends, it was about BDSM porn with tied up women, then my husband's computer was hacked and destroyed several times, obviously photo files were also hacked, because then it got really funny. With my head and name, international porn sites, sex contacts were switched, always the same motto: fucking k. There were started by him and his friends online witch hunts campaigns, identity thefts, hacker attacks, online harrassment and defamation, faked accounts, faked profiles and sex deepfakes and posts and trolling with my name, hate campaigns on the internet against me.
I have to say that once the reputation has been ruined, a woman lives completely unashamedly on the Internet. It is well known that misogynists, sadists, sex offenders and violent offenders, stalkers, perverts and crazy people let off steam on the internet. Some people always have to roll in the dirt, so the best thing to do is laugh at the idiots. And tries to stop them, which turns out to be difficult. But the more women and girls will try to get these idiots off the net and out of life, the better the results. I can only say: Don't let the bastards get you down. Show them where the hammer hangs and I mean that seriously.
And to say to the sexual deepfakes: The really funny thing is, there are no nude photos of me, not a single bikini photo, and I've been fighting pornography with women's organizations since 1977. In the meantime, I wish the stalker that his masculine equipment rots away.
It is now a male hobby to destroy women's and girls' lives worldwide on the Internet, victims of violence and rape are filmed during the act and posted as allegedly sex-horny whores, ex-partners post nude videos and photos on the Internet, send them to friends, Relatives and employers, then the heads of the victims are mounted on perverted porn videos and porn photos and thus the victim is ridiculed and humiliated worldwide. With the exception of Australia, the perpetrators go unpunished worldwide.
The height of the harassment is that I am still bombarded with stupid calls from unknown foreign younger men (sometimes women too)  and  still on the net porn sites under my name are nasty deep fakes, such as the sadistic porn site Assholefever (porn Saddle girls) or an insulting suitor and whore forum, where women even more to be demoted than usual.
But there is also damage to property and human dung in the garden. The Koran says that women are the field of men, but as far as I know the Koran doesn't say that good male Muslims are entitled to shit in women's gardens.There's nothing like human shit, but unfortunately I can't do a DNA test here, can I?
If I were not a polite lady, I would say that my ex-tenant and his Islamist friends are a bunch of stinking, cowardly, disgusting manly shit that will one day disappear like a bunch of shit, because brave people, men and women, have to take care of that if we want to live in a peaceful world.
I can now heartily empathize with a famous personality, Amber Heard,  coming across a psychopath, the actor Johnny Depp and his misogynistic mob. So we can see in the media. A very sad case of misogyny and witch hunts in the media and social media, in the society and the trials. To really get someone down, social media is great for these people. I know that from my own bitter experience and with me many, many women and girls and sometimes men and boys worldwide. The woman is always finished off by the women hating mob. The sad truth is, there are many, many other victims, female and underaged:
 
In December 2007, Tina Meier founded the nonprofit Megan Meier Foundation in Missouri. The non-profit was named in honour of Tina’s 13-year-old daughter who hanged herself in a bedroom closet in October 2006. 1 Megan struggled with attention deficit disorder and depression in addition to issues with her weight. About five weeks before her death, a 16-year-old boy named Josh Evans asked Megan to be friends on the social networking website MySpace. The two began communicating online regularly, although they never met in person or spoke on the phone. 3 “Megan had a lifelong struggle with weight and self-esteem,” Tina said on the Foundation website. “And now she finally had a boy who she thought really thought she was pretty.”
In mid-October, Josh began saying he didn’t want to be friends anymore, and the messages became more cruel on October 16, 2006, when Josh concluded by telling Megan, “The world would be a better place without you.” The cyberbullying escalated when additional classmates and friends on MySpace began writing disturbing messages and bulletins. Tina said on the Foundation website that it was about 20 minutes after Megan went to her room after leaving the computer that the mother found her daughter had hanged herself in her bedroom closet. Megan died the following day, three weeks before what would have been her 14th birthday.
 
Jessica Logan was an 18-year-old Sycamore High School senior who sent nude photo of herself to her boyfriend, but the Cincinnati Enquirer reported that the photo was sent to hundreds of teenagers in at least seven Cincinnati-area high schools after the couple broke up. 3 According to the University of Alabama’s cyberbullying website, the cyber bullying continued through Facebook, MySpace and text messages. Jessica hanged herself 2008 after attending the funeral of another boy who had committed suicide. A little more than one year later, 13-year-old Hope Sitwell hanged herself after a picture of her breasts that she “sexted” to her boyfriend was shared amongst students at six different schools in area of Ruskin, Florida, friends and family told CNN. Hope never told her parents about the “Hope Hater Page” that was started on MySpace that led to additional cyber bullying.
In October 2012, ABC News reported that the video Amanda Todd had posted to YouTube had been viewed more than 17 million times. In the video entitled “My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self harm,” the British Columbia teenager uses flash cards to tell about her experiences of being blackmailed and bullied. 2 A little over a month after posting the video on September 7, 2012, Amanda hanged herself in her home on October 10, 2012.Amanda began using video chat in the seventh grade to meet new people online, and one stranger convinced the teenager to bare her breasts on camera. However, the stranger attempted to use the photo to blackmail Amanda, and the picture began circulating on the internet, including a Facebook profile that used the topless photograph as the profile image. “The Internet stalker she flashed kept stalking her,” Amanda’s mother, Carol Todd, told the Vancouver Sun. “Every time she moved schools he would go undercover and become a Facebook friend.”
 
The violence women and girls experience online is mostly sexualized, clearly misogynistic and often very personal. Female Politicians receive hardcore porn with their heads mounted. Female Journalists are advertised on relevant websites as prostitutes on the Internet. Female Climate activists have to protect their private addresses because the rapists would like to drop by in real life. And of course there are also the dick pics: photos of penises that younger women in particular receive unsolicited direct messages on social media. This development leaves its mark - on women themselves, but not least in our society. Net violence is changing the way women move, behave and express themselves on the Internet. Many women and girls consider very carefully which topics they are still addressing on social media. As a Female You must censor yourself to protect yourself. According to a European study, every second woman stays out of discussions on social networks after such experiences. Politicians are resigning from their offices or no longer running because they can no longer stand the online hatred. Women journalists are more often affected by depression and anxiety disorders due to hatred on the net, report less on certain topics or even consider getting out of journalism altogether. Much of what women have fought for in analogue life since the women's movement is being questioned again online - and often remains unchallenged or unpunished.
Because that is also part of the truth: Many women who defend themselves and go to the police to file a complaint are ridiculed. They are asked why they have to ""provoke so"" or why they not just delete their Facebook account when everything is so bad. Prosecutors are quick to drop proceedings because they do not recognize violence against women as such and do not punish it as hate crime. It takes consistent law enforcement. This can only happen if the authorities are aware that misogyny on the Internet is not a trivial matter and not a coincidence. This not only requires more women in the apparatus, but also training and a management culture that does not downplay or glorify violence against women. Legislation is needed that addresses violence against women. Because if perpetrators are not held accountable, hatred and violence against women in public become a bit more normal every day.
And we, who are part of this public, can help to draw red lines. By supporting women who are being attacked on the internet every day in front of all of us. In concrete terms, this means: solidarity in the comment columns, by direct message or by retweet. Anyone who receives support cannot be silenced so quickly. Knowing that you are not alone is still a great motivation for many politically active women online, not to give up and to oppose the hatred.
We must say it very clear: The biggest hate crime against women right now is: Sexual cyber harassment!
In my cyberstalking case I have as survivor to say: I also found the many dick pics of the perpetrators and rape revenge porn of alleged female and obviously underage female friends of the perpetrators, who looked frightened and sometimes were tied up, covered with sperm, disgusting. More disgusting and cowardly perverse cyber hatred of women is actually in my sight not possible. A female friend from abroad said that when she sees so much disgusting perversity, every woman seeing that has a great lust castrating the perpetrators herself with a kitchen knife. No comment.
 
In 2022, the famous American actress Amber Heard is a victim of a new witch trial, sorry a misogynist defamation trial and  finds herself in the crossfire of public malice, a woman who publicly came out as an abuse victim and was sued for defamation by her ex-husband Johnny Depp. This was now unnecessarily negotiated in public, in frightening to repulsive details and with the hooting of the public online. Judge Penny Azcarate had inexplicably allowed two poolside cameras to broadcast the trial on American cable network Court TV so the nation could watch live as the hideous details of a deeply humiliated, physically and emotionally abused woman and a narcissistic, manipulative, drug-addicted  and alcoholic, misogynistic millionaire and violent criminal, the well-known actor Johnny Depp, were dragged into the public eye. There was no sign of compassion in the court, the jury, the judge, the American media, social networks and the Hollywood scene. Rather the opposite, it reminds you of a medieval witch hunt and for Amber Heard it's the only luck that she wasn't burned alive. But her life and career would be ruined with this modern day witch trial. Because it was Amber Heard who was stylized into pictures from the hall in Virginia on the Internet as a megara who was not in control of her own emotions and had nothing else in mind than destroying an idol. The pop singer Lance Bass recreated a statement by Amber Heard in a Tiktok video, the language app Duolingo made fun of Heard, and pet owners had their four-legged friends portray Amber. Snippets of their statements were taken out of context. The balance of power is clear: the hashtag #JusticeForAmberHeard has 53.3 million views on TikTok, the hashtag #JusticeForJohnnyDepp has 16.2 billion views - 300 times more. The New York Times recognized an ""industrial-scale harassment against Heard"" on the Internet, ""that dwarfs all previous campaigns in the social networks"". so the sheet. Like so many victims of domestic abuse, the traumatized Heard is far away from the ""perfect victim"" one might wish in all too childish naivety. And her crime was to fight back against a misogynist abuser,  there are many countries worldwide, where victims which were fighting back, were lynched, executed, gang raped and killed. The patriarchy wants our silence, so patriarchy must destroy figthing back victims and survivors. The mechanisms of domestic violence and sexual abuse are also known to be far more complex than a simple question of guilt would suggest.
 
That tired old straw man, that ‘men are domestic violence victims too’, was dragged out yet again. Two women a week are killed  in the United States by partners and ex-partners. According to the latest figures from the Office For National Statistics, these make up 44 per cent of female murder victims compared with 6 per cent of male murder victims. Hatred makes strange bedfellows and while those who rail against Amber Heard think of themselves as proudly unwoke, wokeness has given misogyny a new energy, with the now familiar sign of screeching young masked men threatening uppity women – ‘TERFS’ – with violence, sexual or otherwise. We’ve been told to mistrust White Women’s Tears and White Women’s Fragility and Pretty Privilege; that a woman who reports a rapist can be contributing to Carceral Feminism.
Maybe it’s true that Gentleman Johnny was ‘only joking’ when he chuckled about burning and raping his wife – but this was truly a witch-trial and, if they could burn Amber Heard, I have no doubt that the monstrous mob who idolise this sad excuse for a man would do so. The true shame in this sorry tale – no matter what a show the principal players made of themselves – is theirs.
 
MeToo has also brought all of this to light - but now this movement is being undone on social networks. With 280 characters and 15-second videos, there is simply no room for consideration and nuances. In the future, women who have experienced domestic abuse, violence or sexual abuse will once again carefully consider whether they want to talk about what they have experienced - and expose themselves to public doubt about their experiences, even to the point of social annihilation. And the perpetrators have a new and old tool: the libel lawsuit, which subjects its victims to a scathing public tribunal just like Amber Heard had to endure. Because in this case, the victim not only had to endure malice, hatred and hate speech every day, but also had to pay 15 million dollars to the perpetrator, who let himself be celebrated in public with a grin. It might have been different without the digital hate, but juries also look at the media. With the advent of new technologies and social media, more and more women and girls experience harassment, stalking and other types of threats while online. It is estimated that one in ten women in the EU aged 15 and over is a victim of sexual harassment through digital tools. Cyber ​​harassment can include trolling, cyberbullying, flaming, hate speech, and other text and message-based forms of gender-based cyber violence. Of particular concern is a growing phenomenon of cyberbullying and trolling against youth and children, with at least 12.5% ​​of school bullying incidents occurring online.
 
This affects both boys and girls, but young women and girls clearly outnumber the victims, with serious mental health implications. However, the growing phenomenon of gender-based cyber violence is not adequately addressed. EU member states react and act differently, often inadequately, and although it is a cross-border problem, there is currently neither a common definition nor an effective policy approach to combating gender-based cyber violence at EU level. In many countries, including America, cybercrime against women and girls is not an issue! The internet can be a very dangerous space for women. Full of traps and 'opportunities' for perpetrators, largely due to prevailing impunity and a slow and inadequate response from the criminal justice system. So far, the EU and no other country apart from Australia has not done much to ensure that women and girls - who remain the main victims of gender-based cyber violence - can feel safe online. I hope that this will finally change now. It is time for countries around the world to step up their efforts and without further delay come up with a comprehensive policy covering all forms of gender-based violence, including online. When politicians are threatened with murder or rape online, they are often told to ignore it. But these online threats and attacks can translate into physical acts, such as the 2016 assassination of British MP Jo Cox. This must not happen again. More needs to be done to combat harassment and the other threats women and girls face online. Our laws have not been adjusted to address these issues. There is also international support for NetzDG, for example from former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Hate, discrimination and fake news on the Internet are the greatest threats to democracy, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner in a lecture at the Technical University of Munich in February 2018. Social media must therefore be subject to the same rules as traditional media. ""We need the same transparency here,"" Annan said, ""and clear accountability."" I can only fully agree with this comment.

I am referring to fact that they have refused to acknowledge that by her own admission Amber Heard has admitted to abusing her former spouse on numerous occasions. I will not get into the details of he said she said but rather rely on the video taped confession of Ms Heard admitting that she assaulted her ex spouse not only with bare hands but with metal objects, ie pots and pans.</p>
<p>No one should be above the law and people that commit crimes against family shouldn't be protected and definitely not given major movie platforms. If we allow this kind of example to continue and influence our coming generations then we have failed our children.</p>
<p>We strive to live in an age were equality and the merrit of one's soul/character should be the most paramount but unfortunately we have large entities at play that would sacrifice all of this on the alter of the almighty dollar, so if the dollar is all they want and care about then let us all deprive them of this by refusing to buy or subscribe to their products. The only way they will learn is to hit them in the wallet and let them know that we are not going to sacrifice the world we wish to create for future generations just so they can false virtue signal and protect an admitted domestic abuser. We must be the change we wish to create and anyone willing to abuse the ones they claim love must be brought to justice no matter their sex or gender and those willing to prop them and give platforms to this kind of evil must not receive our hard earned dollar.</p>","AT&T, Warner Brothers, Time Warner","Boycott Warner Media and Their Parent Company AT&amp;T!

I am referring to fact that they have refused to acknowledge that by her own admission Amber Heard has admitted to abusing her former spouse on numerous occasions. I will not get into the details of he said she said but rather rely on the video taped confession of Ms Heard admitting that she assaulted her ex spouse not only with bare hands but with metal objects, ie pots and pans.</p>
<p>No one should be above the law and people that commit crimes against family shouldn't be protected and definitely not given major movie platforms. If we allow this kind of example to continue and influence our coming generations then we have failed our children.</p>
<p>We strive to live in an age were equality and the merrit of one's soul/character should be the most paramount but unfortunately we have large entities at play that would sacrifice all of this on the alter of the almighty dollar, so if the dollar is all they want and care about then let us all deprive them of this by refusing to buy or subscribe to their products. The only way they will learn is to hit them in the wallet and let them know that we are not going to sacrifice the world we wish to create for future generations just so they can false virtue signal and protect an admitted domestic abuser. We must be the change we wish to create and anyone willing to abuse the ones they claim love must be brought to justice no matter their sex or gender and those willing to prop them and give platforms to this kind of evil must not receive our hard earned dollar.</p>","AT&T, Warner Brothers, Time Warner","Boycott Warner Media and Their Parent Company AT&amp;T!
