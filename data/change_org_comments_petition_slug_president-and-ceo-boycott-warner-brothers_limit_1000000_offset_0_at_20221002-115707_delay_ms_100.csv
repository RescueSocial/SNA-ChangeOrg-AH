She severed his finger from his body by crushing a vodka bottle down on to it... the force alone shows effort and intent. Definitely not an accident.
That’s just one piece of evidence.
Have you listened to their deposition? Amber openly mocks Depp about admitting that she’s abusive and taunts him that no one would believe him... that’s just plain evil. If that was a scene in a movie she’d most definitely be a villain and you wouldn’t be blaming both of them!
Let’s not forget... after her false allegations she went on to accept being the face of Victims of Abuse movement. Not just is some photo campaign either. She stood at a podium before thousands of REAL abuse victims and have a speech regarding her empathy, sympathy and how they were one and the same!
