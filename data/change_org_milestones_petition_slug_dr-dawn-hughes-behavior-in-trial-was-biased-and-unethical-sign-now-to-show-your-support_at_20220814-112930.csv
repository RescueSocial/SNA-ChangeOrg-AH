<p>I've seen a couple comments saying this is too far or not justified, and in this update I want to address those concerns. I didn't make this petition to attack or destroy Dr. Hughes. In some aspects of her testimony she presents that she is an good CLINICAL psychologist. Meaning she could be highly beneficial in a patient's treatment. She definitely devoted herself to Ms. Heard.</p>
<p>My issue is with her actions in this trial, and any past or future forensic psychology she might be a part of. In forensic psychology, one has to remain separated from the individuals they are asked to examine, in part to prevent bias, but primarily to make sure that justice is carried out. Dr. Shannon Curry was a shining example of this in both her first testimony and her rebuttal testimony. Not only did she not offer an opinion on Mr. Depp's mental state, she also did not offer an opinion in regards to whether or not Ms. Heard was a victim of abuse. She did her examination, evaluation, and testimony on Ms. Heard without believing or disbelieving Ms. Heard's story. THAT is what it is to be a forensic psychologist. You're not a victim advocate, you are only there to provide your professional opinion in regards to what you were asked to assess. THAT is why I created this petition and what I hope to see. I have no issues with Dr. Hughes continuing her clinical practice and hope that she is a benefit to those in need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That being said, I am so excited that we hit 1,000 signatures! Let's set the next goal at 2,000!!!</p>",,,

StarterPetitionUpdate,30545395,2022-05-12T23:16:41.000Z,,Updated Title and Description & Almost 250 Signatures,"<p>We're almost hit 250 signatures! Thank you everyone who signed and thank you especially to those who are sharing! Please keep sharing so we can get more people aware of and behind this cause!</p>
<p>Remember that this petition isn't just about Johnny Depp or Amber Heard, this is about gender stereotypes and the presumption that only men can commit DV/IPV! We know this just isn't true. Abuse has no gender. This petition is in part to remove someone who can't remember the last time she treated/testified about a male victim of IPV that was perpetrated by a FEMALE abuser (listen to her testimony again, she never describes testifying about male victims of female abusers, only treatment of adults that experienced abuse as a child BY ANOTHER MALE, e.g. priest or a coach, or same sex couples), but also to set the precedent that bias, particularly gendered bias, is neither an ethical, nor appropriate component of being a professional in psychology.</p>
<p>I've also updated the title to be less confusing for those who don't know what the ABPP or the APA are, and I updated the description for spelling/grammar and to make it more readable overall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you everyone,</p>

<p>Again no matter which side you support Dr. Hughes' behavior is unacceptable! Please share this petition so we can hit that 1,000 signature goal before May 16th!</p>
