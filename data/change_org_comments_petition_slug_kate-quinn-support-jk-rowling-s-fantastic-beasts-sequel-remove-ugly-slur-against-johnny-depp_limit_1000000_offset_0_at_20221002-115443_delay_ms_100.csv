He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

710931157,"I have had the privilege of meeting Johnny five times at UK premieres. He is a patient, kind gentle soul who really cares about those in the disabled enclosure and children and elderly fans. Johnny does not have the psychological profile of an abuser. Miss Heard allegedly was the abusive partner and allegedly abused her former partner Tasha Van Ree. Johnny's former partner of 14 years - Vanessa Paradis , the Mother of Johnny's children, wrote a letter to the Court in LA to testify that he had never raised his voice or abused her. Winona Ryder, Johnny's former girlfriend and Lori-Anne Allison-Depp, Johnny's first wife attested to his gentleness. The LA Police said no crime had been committed. Miss Heard on the other hand allegedly used to lunge at Johnny and his security team allegedly used to prise her off Johnny. Miss Heard heartlessly served divorce papers on Johnny two or three days after his beloved Mum passed away.

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>

<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

532652693,"I have years of experience in the field of behavior, not just academically but hands on frontline. I also have a theatrical background. I've witnessed or have been right in the middle of dangerous situations countless times throughout my life, starting from an early age. I'm extremely skillful T recognizing and managing those with highly aggressive behaviors, substance abuse issues, codependency, PTSD, and numerous other concerns, with a variety of individuals from all walks of life. I'm booksmart and streetsmart. I've also experienced bullying by a male who was highly regarded and who did everything to destroy what he thought would prevent any chance for any kind of life success. This and many other experiences have taught me how to be shrewdly observant of everyone. I don't have to know Johnny Depp intimately to know that he's innocent. All I have to do is be consciously aware of the fact that there are people in this world who go to great lengths to manipulate others to get what they want. Clearly Mr. Depp has been victimized during his height of vulnerability. Some of us will prefer not to carefully examine all of the true facts. Human nature can get at the best of us but people who admit this to themselves, know an opportunist when there's one cleverly shielding themselves.

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He does not deserve to be treated horrendously as he has. For being in the public as an actor & musician, he is very private when it comes to personal life. In such a messy divorce as he went through, he has handled himself with true style and class. He deserves to be treated as such.

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>

<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>

<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

532163849,"I think the point you make that had any of the allegations Amber Heard made were in any way true, Johnny Depp would have paid upfront to keep her quiet. The fact that he chose to fight it says a lot. As does the fact that she kept saying that she was going to file charges but never did. He was never actually charged. If he had been charged he would have been arrested by the LAPD, that's what they do even before the charge is investigated. And in the end Amber Heard settled. Based on the evidence lists that both sides gave to the court Johnny Depp had proof of something about Amber Heard, something that would have either ruined her career or put her behind bars.  That's why she settled.  The bruises were created by her make up artist friend, text messages were fake and that video that shows a grumpy Johnny Depp pouring a glass of wine, slamming cupboards and then stopping her from recording him, all the while you can hear her egg him on, was a set up obviously. And why is that video so blurry with today's technology. I'm not even 100% sure that's Johnny Depp, the guy actually looks like her father. But we'll assume that it is Johnny Depp since that's what she wanted the public to believe. There was no crime in that video.

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

532153805,"I am signing this petition because people have seem to forgotten that one is ""innocent until proven guilty."" Johnny Depp has had a huge impact on my life and is someone I look up to as a hero, a friend, and family. One does not need to know him personally to understand that he only ever has good intentions towards others. He has always been very gentle, very warm and compassionate, and very sensitive but strong. The hate displayed towards Johnny recently has broke my heart in two repeatedly. This man was not charged with any domestic abuse, he was not arrested for it, and at all times he was willing to take it to court and talk over it with Amber Heard. Whereas she never showed up for her court dates, never gave her evidence to the proper authorities, --but instead sold it to tabloids, and exploited him to the most sinister degree. I am disgusted by this malice towards Johnny, a man who did nothing wrong. It needs to stop, and if one cannot accept that a wonderful and talented man has been cast in the Fantastic Beasts sequel, then they need not go see it. But one should not hate this man based on false accusations and headlines.

""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

Also, I just do not understand why some people just dismiss the initial police reports and also the claims by several other witnesses that no signs of violence were seen.

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

What has happened to the fact that people are innocent until proven guilty by a court of law......and not by the Social Media Court which has happened here and under the umbrella of domestic violence......

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>

<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

Oh, and what about that extra 7 million Amber was demanding Johnny send to the charities because he would get a deduction and supposedly would only have paid half the settlement??  Johnny signed the checks in the name of Amber Heard anyway, so that went away pretty fast. Thank goodness.  Now?  Harry Potter, a boy beaten by his aunt and uncle and messed around by Voldemort more than once...is used as an example of hypocracy by BLIND FAITH in the words of someone who lies about abuse just to get back at Johnny for not  being the ""fantasy"" she had as a teenager...and his money didn't hurt!

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

It is sickening what this i have no word to describe her.... Did to Johnny Depp days after his beloved mother passed away.... The bogus allegations she through out in the media ( never with police & court of law) only AFTER he said no to her insane demands ( blackmail) for months she seen through her lies of fake bruises & lies to the point she refused to be deposed and settled. Only guy what California state law allowed for THE DIVORCE as she dropped the restraining order cuz she knew she lied  Johnny never did, never should touch her or anyone. She was cought in her lies and is disgraced. 

Johnny for 32yrs has taken us on an amazing journey, his creation of characters is magnificent and he is genius at his craft, no one is close to matching this man's talent & dedication.  I can't wait for this good caring loving generous man's future to take us in more amazing journeys",0,0,Event,8655098,4,comment,2016-11-05T03:16:33Z,,75964981,75964981,erica,g,erica,erica g,Fall River,MA,US,,en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],8655098,8655098,Support Fantastic Beasts--Remove Ugly Slur Against Johnny Depp!,2016-11-04T22:58:26Z,,2016-11-04T22:58:26Z,,en-US,['en'],Kate Quinn:  Support JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts Sequel--Remove Ugly Slur Against Johnny Depp!,"<p>Johnny Depp was accused of something he did not do. He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>

He may not have done any prison time, but he may as well be a prisoner of the label inflicted upon him. ""Domestic Abuser,"" is what blindsided Harry Potter fans on Twitter called him as soon as they learned Depp was cast in the saga of JK Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.""  Those outraged by the idea of Johnny Depp having anything to do with Harry Potter, a story that promotes anti-bullying and awareness of domestic violence towards children, etc...they NEED to know that this man is INNOCENT. Johnny Depp knew, like so many others, that the West Memphis Three were innocent. He campaigned passionately for them along with Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and others. However, even after all was said and done, the Three were released from prison, ONLY if they pleaded guilty to murders they never committed! Now, they will wear that stigma on their characters for years, unless they can somehow re-open the case and prove themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was arrested for hitting Tasya Van Ree in 2009, and even if Tasya, obviously still a victim in denial, declared homophobia to be the reason for the arrest?  Beverly Ellis, the very officer who made the arrest, revealed herself and shot back at Tasya's claims.  Ellis is an openly gay woman.  </p>
<p>Domestic Violence against women is too strong an issue to just blindly look at the surface and run on emotions alone. There are many facets to Domestic Violence.  Women are not the only victims of it.  Children, obviously, and even men, are often victims as well.  How many obvious signs that Amber Heard lied about her husband's ""violence"" were ignored?  Probably more signs than there are letters in the alphabet.  The four that stand out in my mind, however, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those people who SAW, with their own eyes that Amber was NOT bruised the night of, and after May 21st, i.e. Johnny's bodyguards and the concierge at the L.A. Condominium.</li>
<li>The picture of a perfectly bruise-free Amber on Instagram, taken that very next day, Sunday, May 22nd that was suddenly, mysteriously deleted before the abuse claims became headline news.</li>
<li>Vanessa Paradis, a MOM, supposedly dumped by Depp FOR Heard, supporting the father of her kids.  What mom in her right mind would not have had full custody of those two teens had Johnny indeed been beating Amber all through their relationship?  And don't tell me she wouldn't have known...Johnny stays close with his family, and that includes the mother of his kids.</li>
<li>Most Important: The LAPD.  The police, especially in L.A. are NOT allowed to turn a blind eye to a woman claiming abuse by her husband.  Even if said woman didn't file a report.  Why was Johnny Depp not arrested?  Simple.  Not only did the police see no evidence of violence or disarray in the room(""No evidence of a crime"") but they also stated that Amber never mentioned violence.,</li>
</ol>
<p><br>It's a terrible, distasteful slur on humanity that feminism has become so dogmatic that anyone who looked closely at both sides of Amber Heard's story were mocked, shunned, and many times cyberbullied in horrible ways.  Lily Rose Depp endured many horrible words on one of her posts on Instagram.  One highly emotional and angry woman actually stated that Lily Rose should never have been born!  A woman, angry about another woman's alleged, but not PROVEN, abuse, shot back by emotionally abusing ANOTHER woman--a young one at that!  This hypocrisy is the result of leaning too much on emotion and personal experience, rather than facts.    Amber Heard has an arrest record of Domestic Violence--Johnny Depp doesn't even have a history of it.  Johnny Depp has a history of hitting furniture, throwing bottles, whatnot, trashing hotel rooms, but those things are inanimate objects.  He never once hit a woman in the history of his career or we would have heard about it, and he would have owned up and gone for help.  I forgot one more telltale sign. Why did Johnny Depp refuse Amber instant spousal support if he physically abused her the whole time they were together? He'd have given half his fortune in a heartbeat if any of her claims had been true. </p>
<p>As hard as it is for many to accept, being that she's a woman, the truth is that Amber Heard has insulted the cause of Stopping Domestic Violence Against Women.  She did so by accusing an innocent man of hurting her physically, when it's crystal clear Johnny Depp did no such thing.  The signs are all there.  Heard may or may not have done it for money but she certainly did it spitefully--obviously because their relationship was toxic from go.  Amber clearly is a sick, sad person who could benefit from professional help--but she doesn't seem to be seeking any.  However--we cannot let her lies OR her myopic supporters affect Johnny doing his job, when he does it so beautifully!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp had to have gone through intense agony this past summer, although he hid it well with a brave face. It may not be desirable to him to re-open the case and prove Amber Heard a liar, given the stress it would bring about for him and his family. However, let's not forget that Depp was prepared with 23 witnesses for the upcoming trial in August.  </p>
<p>Of course, Amber Heard is a master at what she set out to do to him. She, having lived with and known him for four years, knew how to push Johnny Depp's buttons. It was malicious. Once Amber learned of all the ammunition Johnny had gathered for his defense, she wasted no time putting out that video of Johnny cursing and banging around inanimate objects while drunk. She denied putting the video out, but that was just a cover up. No one who saw that video didn't cringe when they saw Johnny Depp really angry--for real, not playing a character. Those who supported Amber took that video and assumed the worst. However, they failed to notice many things.  For one, the camera filming the video was BEHIND Amber Heard, not held in her hand. Why else would we see her? What we hear at the end of the video which may sound like a scuffle and perhaps Amber being thrown to the floor--is actually Johnny ripping the hidden camera out of the wall. What else would it be? He gestures to Amber's hand holding the remote to the camera. But he did not grab the remote. He went right for the camera.  Also, Johnny believed he was by himself before Amber showed up, asking ""What happened?"" and so on.  Angry as Johnny was, he never verbally abused or degraded Heard, calling her horrific names and slandering her character. His only action was to reach for the remote control in her hand...and then make a bee line for the camera to dismantle it. </p>
<p>The final straw for Depp was the picture of the severed finger, and the message he ""supposedly"" wrote on a mirror that indicated Amber Heard had been unfaithful to Johnny with Billy Bob Thornton.</p>
<p>NOBODY took into consideration that despite the report of ""Johnny's dipping his gushing finger in paint""...that mirror would be spattered with blood and the message would never have been legible. Why didn't anyone consider that?</p>
<p>Whoever painted that horrible message about Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton on that mirror--was not someone with a severed finger gushing blood.  Johnny Depp never painted that message.  That is clear evidence that again, was overlooked by supporters of Amber Heard.</p>
<p>The horrific anguish which I have been through myself, that women have suffered in domestically violent relationships with men, again, caused emotions to run high when Depp was accused. Emotions alone and not sense ruled those supporting Amber in the social media trial. As emotional as I got, however,I also made sure to look carefully at all the clear evidence on both sides. Once I learned what was really going on, I, yes, joined the fray and went to town on social media.  I defended Johnny like a raging lion and still do.  But we will not bring Johnny Depp peace by fighting and mud-slinging with each other.</p>
<p>We need to show support and promote awareness of Domestic Violence against ALL humans. We need to NOT lessen the importance of stopping REAL Abuse Against Women--but we can't forget that all men are not perpetrators and misogynists. Johnny Depp isn't just one more ""white male celebrity who can get away with hitting his wife and still work."" This is not about that. Johnny Depp is INNOCENT. Mel Gibson and other male celebrities who were proven guilty, yes, may not have much trouble getting work. It's a sad state of affairs, yes, and I am not denying that sexism and misogyny are alive and well in Hollywood. However?  Once all aspects are studied carefully and looked at with at least one foot in logic, not emotion, we CAN see that Johnny Depp was framed.  That said?  We cannot afford to allow Depp to be lumped in with those who actually DID hurt their girlfriends/wives.  That does not help women who suffer violence in the home, any more than allowing these other GUILTY celebrities to continue to work in Hollywood does.</p>
<p>Let's stand strong against violence, lies, bullying and ALL forms of abuse! Let's remember that not ALL celebrity men are conceited misogynists who don't care about anybody but themselves. Johnny Depp has always been real, upfront and has always spoken his Truth. Everyone who meets him or watches an interview with him knows how GENUINELY kind and good he truly is. It's not an act. No one who works with Johnny doesn't know that, no one who loves him doesn't know that.  </p>
<p>Stereotypes, Blindsidedness, bias towards ONE gender who gets domestically violated, stops here.  The unfairly boycotted ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" has a powerful message about how we handle time. Time gives before it takes. Let's use Time as a gift to help end blind fear, needless boycotting, bullying and hate!  LOVE is what keeps Johnny Depp going, as the video above relays.   Johnny was also honored with the Healing and Hope award by Rhonda's Kiss  for his work to find a cure for cancer.  His beloved mother, Betty Sue, died of cancer on May 20th. Here also is a video montage of Johnny discussing what his two children, Lily Rose and Jack, mean to him.  Lily Rose had E-Coli in 2007 and made it through, as Johnny also mentions in his Rhonda's Kiss acceptance speech.</p>
