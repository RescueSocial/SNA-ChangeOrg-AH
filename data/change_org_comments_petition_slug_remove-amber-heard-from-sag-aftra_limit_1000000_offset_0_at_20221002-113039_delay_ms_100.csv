<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5.

The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8. The National Board may adopt rules governing the investigation of charges and the conduct of any hearings or appeals under this Article.</p>","Fran Drescher, Joely Fisher",Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,,,,US,,,,,,,remove-amber-heard-from-sag-aftra,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 89}, {'id': 468100, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 44}, {'id': 7984, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'domestic violence', 'slug': 'domestic-violence-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 465}, {'id': 398632, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Narcissistic abuse', 'slug': 'narcissistic-abuse-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 20}]",True,False,,1940,1940,0,4474,447,0,5,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,6676818,6676818,Christine,Sanders,Christine,Christine Sanders,Los Angeles,CA,US,,en-US,,[],102,1653619071,3,1655106201,43,1653667627,2,1653397716,5,1653576212,12,1654916410,2,1653044497,135,1660221378.257,25,1660617270.664,106,1656085110.592,3,1653391412.072,39,1660361555.988,36,1657443559.297,28,1656085103.913,"[{'id': 12753911, 'display_name': 'Fran Drescher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Fran', 'last_name': 'Drescher', 'title': 'President, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652256}, 'has_email': False}, {'id': 12753912, 'display_name': 'Joely Fisher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'joely-fisher-5f8003cb-ba57-43bd-8968-8f56072686b5', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Joely', 'last_name': 'Fisher', 'title': 'Secretary-Treasurer, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652257}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Christine Sanders,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,active,2500,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,12753911,Fran Drescher,,Custom,fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713,,,False,,,,,True,Fran,Drescher,"President, SAG-AFTRA",12652256,False,77.6

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8. The National Board may adopt rules governing the investigation of charges and the conduct of any hearings or appeals under this Article.</p>","Fran Drescher, Joely Fisher",Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,,,,US,,,,,,,remove-amber-heard-from-sag-aftra,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 89}, {'id': 468100, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 44}, {'id': 7984, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'domestic violence', 'slug': 'domestic-violence-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 465}, {'id': 398632, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Narcissistic abuse', 'slug': 'narcissistic-abuse-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 20}]",True,False,,1940,1940,0,4474,447,0,5,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,6676818,6676818,Christine,Sanders,Christine,Christine Sanders,Los Angeles,CA,US,,en-US,,[],102,1653619071,3,1655106201,43,1653667627,2,1653397716,5,1653576212,12,1654916410,2,1653044497,135,1660221378.257,25,1660617270.664,106,1656085110.592,3,1653391412.072,39,1660361555.988,36,1657443559.297,28,1656085103.913,"[{'id': 12753911, 'display_name': 'Fran Drescher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Fran', 'last_name': 'Drescher', 'title': 'President, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652256}, 'has_email': False}, {'id': 12753912, 'display_name': 'Joely Fisher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'joely-fisher-5f8003cb-ba57-43bd-8968-8f56072686b5', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Joely', 'last_name': 'Fisher', 'title': 'Secretary-Treasurer, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652257}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Christine Sanders,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,active,2500,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,12753911,Fran Drescher,,Custom,fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713,,,False,,,,,True,Fran,Drescher,"President, SAG-AFTRA",12652256,False,77.6

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4.

Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5.

The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

833057195,I believe this woman has systematically tortured and ruined a man's life for personal gain. I can't name anything other than Aquaman that she acted in. I didn't watch the movie. What person that has been through dv not cry when faced with the person who allegedly harmed her? Who would marry a person that harmed them? As a dv survivor she disgusts me.

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5.

If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8. The National Board may adopt rules governing the investigation of charges and the conduct of any hearings or appeals under this Article.</p>","Fran Drescher, Joely Fisher",Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,,,,US,,,,,,,remove-amber-heard-from-sag-aftra,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 89}, {'id': 468100, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 44}, {'id': 7984, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'domestic violence', 'slug': 'domestic-violence-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 465}, {'id': 398632, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Narcissistic abuse', 'slug': 'narcissistic-abuse-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 20}]",True,False,,1940,1940,0,4474,447,0,5,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,6676818,6676818,Christine,Sanders,Christine,Christine Sanders,Los Angeles,CA,US,,en-US,,[],102,1653619071,3,1655106201,43,1653667627,2,1653397716,5,1653576212,12,1654916410,2,1653044497,135,1660221378.257,25,1660617270.664,106,1656085110.592,3,1653391412.072,39,1660361555.988,36,1657443559.297,28,1656085103.913,"[{'id': 12753911, 'display_name': 'Fran Drescher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Fran', 'last_name': 'Drescher', 'title': 'President, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652256}, 'has_email': False}, {'id': 12753912, 'display_name': 'Joely Fisher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'joely-fisher-5f8003cb-ba57-43bd-8968-8f56072686b5', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Joely', 'last_name': 'Fisher', 'title': 'Secretary-Treasurer, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652257}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Christine Sanders,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,active,2500,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,12753911,Fran Drescher,,Custom,fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713,,,False,,,,,True,Fran,Drescher,"President, SAG-AFTRA",12652256,False,77.6

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5.

If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Amber is a horrible and dangerous performer and sadly she makes a mockery of the real victims of DV by telling so many lies which are now being exposed to the world, therefore all women or any victims of abuse trying to tell their story in the future will have been set back by her actions of accusing Johnny Depp of forms of abuse and her claims clearly proving to the world to be false which is a real insult to real victims and why so many people are so outraged. Amber does not deserve the title of a screen actor and she does not deserve the privilege of being a member of the guild when she has clearly horribly ABUSED and DEFACED and defamed another member and wonderful actor and human being in Johnny Depp who did not deserve to lose his jobs or anything over her false claims but sadly she tried to destroy and unfairly cancel him. The public opinion is loud and clear that she will not be seen in any good light and she is quickly losing all respect and has no credibility in the trial of public opinion so will very much be a liability to future projects, she has shown she cannot be trusted and now no one in their right mind wants anything to do with her, fans everywhere very clearly do not admire her at all and she is probably the most disliked person around at the moment besides other criminals, war tyrants and bad politicians.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5.

The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any.

<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7. A member may be expelled from membership only by two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of the National Board members voting on the issue.<br>8. The National Board may adopt rules governing the investigation of charges and the conduct of any hearings or appeals under this Article.</p>","Fran Drescher, Joely Fisher",Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,,,,US,,,,,,,remove-amber-heard-from-sag-aftra,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 89}, {'id': 468100, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Amber Heard', 'slug': 'amber-heard-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 44}, {'id': 7984, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'domestic violence', 'slug': 'domestic-violence-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 465}, {'id': 398632, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Narcissistic abuse', 'slug': 'narcissistic-abuse-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 20}]",True,False,,1940,1940,0,4474,447,0,5,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,6676818,6676818,Christine,Sanders,Christine,Christine Sanders,Los Angeles,CA,US,,en-US,,[],102,1653619071,3,1655106201,43,1653667627,2,1653397716,5,1653576212,12,1654916410,2,1653044497,135,1660221378.257,25,1660617270.664,106,1656085110.592,3,1653391412.072,39,1660361555.988,36,1657443559.297,28,1656085103.913,"[{'id': 12753911, 'display_name': 'Fran Drescher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Fran', 'last_name': 'Drescher', 'title': 'President, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652256}, 'has_email': False}, {'id': 12753912, 'display_name': 'Joely Fisher', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'joely-fisher-5f8003cb-ba57-43bd-8968-8f56072686b5', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': None, 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Joely', 'last_name': 'Fisher', 'title': 'Secretary-Treasurer, SAG-AFTRA', 'id': 12652257}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Christine Sanders,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,Remove Amber Heard from SAG-AFTRA,active,2500,226615193,photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x400-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-400x225-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-800x450-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/8/fd/xi/QaFDXIiXoJCujAX-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1652461184,False,1600,900,photo,12753911,Fran Drescher,,Custom,fran-drescher-7b08ed8b-31db-4be2-b539-d6a2acd81713,,,False,,,,,True,Fran,Drescher,"President, SAG-AFTRA",12652256,False,77.6

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision. On any appeal, the charges may be upheld, dismissed, the decision modified, or the charges referred to the disciplinary committee for further proceedings.<br>7.

<p>Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution, which deals with the “Discipline of Members,” states:</p>
<p>A. A member may be reprimanded, censured, fined, suspended or expelled from membership in the Union for any of the following offenses:<br>1. Violation of any of the provisions of this Constitution, or the policies, rules or regulations adopted by the Union or any of its Locals.<br>2. Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4. Unless the charges are dismissed pursuant to subparagraph B(3) of this Article, the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, shall give written notice to the member or members charged, attaching a copy of the charges and setting a hearing date at least fourteen (14) days in advance.<br>5. Prior to a hearing before the disciplinary committee, the National Board may designate a representative(s) to meet with a member who has been charged with any of the offenses set forth in this Article. The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them. The charged member shall be given written notice of the decision and penalty, if any. The National Board, or a disciplinary appeals committee designated by it, has authority to review the disciplinary committee’s decision and penalty, if any, on its own motion or on the member’s written appeal filed with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, or the National Executive Director, or their designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of sending of notice of the disciplinary committee’s decision.

Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3.

If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.

Engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the Union, any of its affiliated Locals or its membership, including providing services covered by the Union’s jurisdiction for any employer declared unfair by the National Board.</p>
<p>B. Procedure for Discipline<br>1. Any member in good standing, any affiliated Local, the National Executive Director or their designee, may file with the Secretary-Treasurer, or their designee, written charges against any member alleging facts describing any of the offenses set forth in this Article.<br>2. Charges must be filed within six (6) months of knowledge of the action or event that gave rise to the charges. Charges must set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the offense and the facts underlying it.<br>3. The National Board, or its designee, shall review the charges and dismiss them if they have not been timely filed, if the act complained of does not constitute a violation subject to discipline under this Constitution or in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for proceeding.<br>4.

The National Board’s representative(s) may offer a resolution to the charges that, if the member accepts, would be final and binding. If the member does not accept the offer, a disciplinary committee will be convened to hear and determine the charges, as described in this Article.<br>6. The National Board, or a disciplinary committee appointed pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the National Board, shall hear and decide the charges. At the hearing, a charged party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony, and may have a representative assist them.
