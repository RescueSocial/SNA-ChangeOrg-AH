They are once again ignoring the fact that SC covid numbers are higher than ever before. FYI: DD2 has already decided to do 2 weeks e-learning for all students for the two week after winter break. So I\u2019m not sure how soon they want these kids back. Sounds like they don\u2019t want them home for Christmas break even.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A few of the lies they are telling people:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kids don\u2019t get covid. WRONG! As of mid November over 1 million young people (infants through teenagers) had tested positive for covid. Imagine how many are asymptotic and spreading to adults? While the cases are usually mild, over 100 children have died from covid. Now, that may seem like a low number but how low is that number when one of them might be YOUR child?\u00a0</li>\n<li>They have called teachers lazy. call them Cowards. Even ranted about them being Sociopath on social media.\u00a0<br><br></li>\n<li>they have accused the virtual students of cheating because they are not at school. </li>\n<li>they claim Students are falling behind and failing but the reality is that number of students failing a class right now half way though the first \u00a0semester is only marginally higher than this same time last year. I don\u2019t know maybe because they have been trying to survive through a global pandemic. Could be why they are a little slow with the math facts and the vocabulary. Just saying.\u00a0<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line, it\u2019s not the time. It\u2019s too risky. Stop fighting the same old fight of \u201cthis is too hard for me so we have to go back to regular school\u201d. \u00a0Right now we have to be adaptable\u00a0and make THIS LEARNING MODEL WORK! We have to come together as a community to make this work for our students.\u00a0<br><br><em><strong>PLEASE SIGN AND SHARE THIS EVERYWHERE!\u00a0</strong></em></p>", "photo": {"id": "224994601", "petitionMedium": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/5/jt/te/tEjTTErbYXjsnkE-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608436636", "processing": false}}, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27827226", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T22:16:23.000Z", "signatureCount": 750}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27794992", "createdAt": "2020-09-27T13:02:14.000Z", "signatureCount": 500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27791453", "createdAt": "2020-09-26T14:16:09.000Z", "signatureCount": 250}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27790911", "createdAt": "2020-09-26T11:24:06.000Z", "signatureCount": 200}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27789298", "createdAt": "2020-09-26T00:47:14.000Z", "signatureCount": 100}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27789175", "createdAt": "2020-09-26T00:05:53.000Z", "signatureCount": 50}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27789149", "createdAt": "2020-09-25T23:55:29.000Z", "signatureCount": 25}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27789093", "createdAt": "2020-09-25T23:40:50.000Z", "signatureCount": 10}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "27789062", "createdAt": "2020-09-25T23:30:53.000Z", "signatureCount": 5}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjk=", "hasNextPage": false}}}}}], "count": 1, "cursors": [""]}
