<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales. Negative backlash from the public is an unreasonable fear, as your releasing the movie will surely result in the exact opposite. </p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales. Negative backlash from the public is an unreasonable fear, as your releasing the movie will surely result in the exact opposite. </p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

JohnnyDepp is abused from all sides, I never understand why, even those in his native country, do not want this film, which has very good reviews where it was seen, I have seen the film and I recommend it to everyone. I congratulate the whole team of professionals who made a movie about a true story, masterfully! By far, I find the best compositional role of our handsome Johnny Depp Star! The right to work and to harness work is a legal right, for all people, so let the film run in the U.S., has nothing to do with his trial at court with his ex wife, with the movie Minamata!!

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

I Love JD and his bigger than life heart!! One of the most caring people you will ever meet. He deserves so much more than what he is giving he must be so disheartened right now. Poor kind soul!!

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

Moreover, this film MUST be watched because it touches on social issues. Ecology is a global problem for which there are no state borders. The film does not leave you indifferent. And to justify not releasing the film by the personal problems of Johnny Depp (who perfectly played the photographer Eugene Smith) is silly. Firstly, because he is innocent, secondly, the artistic value of the film is much higher, and thirdly, many people watch movies, but are not interested in the personal lives of the actors.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

This is extremely disheartening and ignorant. First of all the movie would give people information not known and the acting was done by a phenomenal actor!

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

It is a shame that the studios, especially Warner Bros & MGM would deny people and descendants of the tragedy to see the story come to life because the studios want to punish Johnny Depp; who has never been charged or found guilty of domestic abuse and if anything, so far has submitted official proof to show he was the abused and their is nothing to date proving he is the abuser.

The studios should be ashamed of themselves for backing an self proclaimed abuser & shelving the work that so many put their heart & soul into getting this film created.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

The message in it is powerful and there are people in the world that are still suffering from this deadly disease and the message should be told. There is a mountain of evidence to prove that he is innocent of any domestic abuse of anybody. In Johnny's case the victim is being treated like he is guilty and the guilty is being treated like she is innocent. This is not right and a slap in the face to all victims of abuse. Amber tried to ruin Johnny and MGM is not helping the situation.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales. Negative backlash from the public is an unreasonable fear, as your releasing the movie will surely result in the exact opposite. </p>

<p>We stand with Johnny Depp, and we stand with the victims and survivors of Minamata, and we hope this petition serves to prove to you, MGM, that we WANT the release of Minamata. </p>",MGM,Release Minamata Movie,,,,US,,,,,,,mgm-release-minamata-movie,published,,,False,False,,False,,"[{'id': 7482, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Entertainment', 'slug': 'entertainment-11', 'photo_id': 139992269, 'created_by_owner': True, 'created_by_staff_member': False, 'total_count': 123929}, {'id': 4435, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'movies', 'slug': 'movies-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 689}, {'id': 258896, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Movie release', 'slug': 'movie-release-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 1}, {'id': 44549, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Business and Brands', 'slug': 'business-and-brands-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 2397}, {'id': 4567, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'mgm studios', 'slug': 'mgm-studios', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 5}, {'id': 232583, 'locale': 'en-US', 'name': 'Johnny Depp', 'slug': 'johnny-depp-en-us', 'photo_id': None, 'created_by_owner': False, 'created_by_staff_member': True, 'total_count': 89}]",True,False,,3571,3571,0,11594,1951,0,1,0,0,0,207,,ReleaseMinamata,,,,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,632,1638161883,667,1657204079.774,67,1658367238,49,1653989434,182,56,1658367257.894,6,5,180,38,1652612104.174,1634604327,1636932213,51,4,1654729548.129,1627744551.534,1633111341.986,222,1633795012,67,1,1654801548.556,390,1627706299.884,1657204126.388,11,1630375535,1640040222,969487981,969487981,Bri,M,Bri,Bri M,Surprise,AZ,US,https://www.twitter.com/nearlydear,en-US,,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,[],"[{'id': 596168, 'display_name': 'MGM', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'mgm', 'description': None, 'photo_id': None, 'publicly_visible': False, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': None, 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'MGM', 'last_name': None, 'title': None, 'id': 41848}, 'has_email': False}]",False,False,False,Bri M,225797714,photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-48x48-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-128x128-noPad.jpg?1627501941,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/6/hg/hn/xjHGhNNOlPHWPao-800x800-noPad.jpg?1627501942,False,800,800,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,MGM: Release Minamata Movie,active,5000,225795146,photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x400-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-400x225-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1627426387,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/9/et/cl/kHETCLIenFpOcDh-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1627426388,False,1600,900,photo,596168,MGM,,Custom,mgm,,,False,,,en-US,,True,MGM,,,41848,False,71.42

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood.

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>

<p><strong> About the victims whom story is depicted in the movie</strong>:</p>
<p>Minamata disease was first discovered in the city of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from a chemical factory owned by the Chisso Corporation, which continued from 1932 to 1968. It has also been suggested that some of the mercury sulfate in the wastewater was also metabolized to methylmercury by bacteria in the sediment. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated and biomagnified in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning and widespread death and suffering. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, Chisso and the Kumamoto prefectural government did little to prevent the epidemic, and even went as far as to try and bury it, much like MGM is for the time being attempting to do with this film. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially recognised as having Minamata disease (1,784 of whom had died)</p>

<p><br>Not only is the public outraged by this, but they are banding together to push MGM to release the film with “<strong>#ReleaseMinamataMovie</strong>” which is currently trending on Twitter alongside “<strong>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</strong>”. The people want to see this movie, and a large portion of the reason being that they want to support Johnny Depp, as it is now widely known that he is a victim of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-wife, Amber Heard. </p>
<p>The people refuse to stand by silently as Johnny Depp is yet again treated wrongfully (for things there is more than enough evidence readily available to prove that he did not do) with extreme bias by the morally corrupt and biased media, and Hollywood. Even putting Johnny Depp aside for one moment, MGM is clearly ignoring the weight of awareness this film carries, and that withholding Minamata’s release is depriving thousands of victims their voice, and their experiences. <br><br></p>
<p>MGM: Read the room, and realize that the people want this movie released. This goes far beyond Johnny Depp and his trials over the last few years. If you were unaware, there is a Change Petition to “Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2” that’s garnered over 2 million signatures (and counting) Not to mention the success, support, and gratitude from the public for Dior, who has chosen to stand firmly with Johnny Depp for the sale of their cologne “Sauvage” which broke records in it’s sales.
