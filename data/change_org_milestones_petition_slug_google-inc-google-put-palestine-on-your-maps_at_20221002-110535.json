This is a war of perception. A war for the hearts and minds of the people who, on the basis of misleading propaganda, support Israel either actively or tacitly by failing to speak out against Israel's brutal occupation and ethnic cleansing and apartheid policies.\n\nIf a state does not exist on the world's most authoritative maps, then it ceases to exist in public consciousness and public perception.  Eventually, it ceases to exist *in fact*. Children around the world are now being taught geography with a map of the Middle East in which no such place as Palestine exists. Instead, the whole of Palestine is titled \"ISRAEL\". \n\nMake no mistake, the omission of Palestine from Google Maps is a deliberate act in support of Israel's ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign. It is the online parallel of events taking place on the ground.\n\nGoogle representatives have claimed that Palestinian land is delineated by broken lines (without being named) because the borders are \"contested\". But contested by whom? Contested only by Israel. The Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is illegal under international law. By refusing to identify Palestine in its maps, Google has in effect - and in fact - aligned itself with the Israeli government's position and its illegal and unjust policies.\n\nLast week our campaign, and the issues it raises, was featured extensively in newspapers and media outlets around the world, including The Guardian, The Huffington Post, The Telegraph, Al Jazeera, India Times, Breitbart, Russia Today, The Jerusalem Post and many others. When Google was asked to comment, a spokesperson responded by pointing out that Palestine had not been deleted from Google Maps, and that in fact it had never been listed in the first place. This is a bit like a man who is accused of beating his wife the previous day arguing that the charge is false because he has actually been beating her for years, but it was Google's idea of a \"denial\". \n\nThis Google statement was a response to a claim made by an individual not connected in any way with this campaign, or with this petition, who had mistakenly stated that Google had recently deleted Palestine from its maps. However, neither I nor anyone connected with this campaign, or this petition, have ever claimed that the omission of Palestine was a recent deletion. \n\nThe aim of this campaign, and the name of this petition, is \"Google: Put Palestine On Your Maps\". Not \"Google: restore Palestine to your maps\". The issue is not whether Palestine was ever included in Google Maps. The issue is that it ought to be included, and there is no excuse for not including it. And if it wasn't included in the past, it should have been. The fact that it wasn't reflects even more badly on Google.\n\nSo far we have had no direct response from Google. For the moment we will continue to collect signatures and publish posts and articles drawing attention to the issue. If Google persists in identifying Palestine as Israel in its maps, our next step will be to call for a boycott of Google.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your support.

However, for an issue as important as this one, we need a lot more signatures if our petition is to have any real impact. Our plan is to issue a press release drawing attention to this issue when we have 100,000 signatures. \n\nYou can help us to reach our target by posting (or reposting) the link to our petition on your facebook page (or re-posting it, tweeting it to your followers on Twitter, or sharing it on Palestine support group websites, blogs etc. Please do whatever you can to make more people aware of this petition. Every signature counts.\n\nAgain, this is an important issue, as Google Maps are now regarded as definitive by people around the world, including journalists, students and others carrying out research into the Israel-Palestine situation. And perception is at least as important, at this stage, as events \"on the ground\". Recognition of Palestine by Google may even turn out to be as important as recognition by organizations like the U.N.\n\nWhat you may not be aware of is that Palestine - or at least the \"Palestinian Territories\" - were previously designated in Google Maps, but all mention of Palestine was removed at the insistence of the Israeli government, which claimed that by including Palestine in its maps, Google was interfering with the \"peace process\" by pre-empting the outcome of any two-state solution that might be reached. (The fact that Google's two Jewish founders have close links with Israel and its leaders might have had some bearing on their willingness to acquiesce to Israel's demands).\n\nIf this argument had any merit at the time it was made (and of course it didn't), it certainly cannot be claimed to have any merit now that Palestine has been given de facto recognition by the UN, and the Israeli government has made it clear that it has no intention of ever agreeing to a two state solution or giving back the Palestinian land it illegally occupies. The \"peace process\" is dead and buried.\n\nGoogle has no grounds whasoever for omitting Palestine from its maps. The fact that Israel - an artificial state established on Palestinian territory - is clearly designated on Google Maps, while Palestine itself has been \"airbrushed\" out, is outrageous and deeply offensive to Palestinians. It is the online parallel of Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian villages and changing Palestinian place names in an effort to erase Palestine from the map. Google is aiding and abetting the Israeli government in this ethnic cleansing program.\n\nThank you again for your support.", "photo": null, "video": null, "embeddedMedia": null}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15872741", "createdAt": "2016-03-17T17:04:30.000Z", "signatureCount": 25000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15840323", "createdAt": "2016-03-15T12:06:48.000Z", "signatureCount": 20000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15816956", "createdAt": "2016-03-13T14:57:01.000Z", "signatureCount": 17500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15785690", "createdAt": "2016-03-10T18:15:06.000Z", "signatureCount": 15000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15761060", "createdAt": "2016-03-08T23:13:04.000Z", "signatureCount": 12500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15752225", "createdAt": "2016-03-08T11:06:19.000Z", "signatureCount": 10000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15750242", "createdAt": "2016-03-08T06:41:20.000Z", "signatureCount": 9000}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjIz", "hasNextPage": true}}}}}, {"data": {"petition": {"id": "6325562", "slug": "google-inc-google-put-palestine-on-your-maps", "user": {"id": "17601959", "displayName": "Zak Martin", "photo": {"id": "4666793", "userSmall": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/0/re/ek/CSreEkuZZSGXMVP-48x48-noPad.jpg?1517505154", "processing": false}}}, "organization": {"id": "1233707", "name": "Google: Put Palestine On Your Maps!", "photo": null}, "updatesConnection": {"nodes": [{"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15748124", "createdAt": "2016-03-08T00:47:36.000Z", "signatureCount": 8000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15747026", "createdAt": "2016-03-07T22:35:00.000Z", "signatureCount": 7500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15744821", "createdAt": "2016-03-07T19:47:03.000Z", "signatureCount": 7000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15741167", "createdAt": "2016-03-07T14:29:00.000Z", "signatureCount": 6000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15738113", "createdAt": "2016-03-07T09:01:09.000Z", "signatureCount": 5000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15735332", "createdAt": "2016-03-07T00:34:53.000Z", "signatureCount": 4000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15733577", "createdAt": "2016-03-06T20:48:11.000Z", "signatureCount": 3000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15732797", "createdAt": "2016-03-06T19:25:37.000Z", "signatureCount": 2500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15732059", "createdAt": "2016-03-06T18:13:50.000Z", "signatureCount": 2000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15730811", "createdAt": "2016-03-06T15:52:02.000Z", "signatureCount": 1500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15728051", "createdAt": "2016-03-06T09:32:46.000Z", "signatureCount": 1000}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15726470", "createdAt": "2016-03-06T04:30:51.000Z", "signatureCount": 750}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjM1", "hasNextPage": true}}}}}, {"data": {"petition": {"id": "6325562", "slug": "google-inc-google-put-palestine-on-your-maps", "user": {"id": "17601959", "displayName": "Zak Martin", "photo": {"id": "4666793", "userSmall": {"url": "//assets.change.org/photos/0/re/ek/CSreEkuZZSGXMVP-48x48-noPad.jpg?1517505154", "processing": false}}}, "organization": {"id": "1233707", "name": "Google: Put Palestine On Your Maps!", "photo": null}, "updatesConnection": {"nodes": [{"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15724913", "createdAt": "2016-03-05T22:57:27.000Z", "signatureCount": 500}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15722708", "createdAt": "2016-03-05T18:47:43.000Z", "signatureCount": 250}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15720887", "createdAt": "2016-03-05T15:18:39.000Z", "signatureCount": 100}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15720146", "createdAt": "2016-03-05T14:05:53.000Z", "signatureCount": 50}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15719543", "createdAt": "2016-03-05T12:55:43.000Z", "signatureCount": 25}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15717050", "createdAt": "2016-03-05T05:53:55.000Z", "signatureCount": 10}, {"__typename": "MilestonePetitionUpdate", "id": "15713333", "createdAt": "2016-03-04T20:22:54.000Z", "signatureCount": 5}], "pageInfo": {"endCursor": "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjQy", "hasNextPage": false}}}}}], "count": 4, "cursors": ["", "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjEx", "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjIz", "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjM1"]}
