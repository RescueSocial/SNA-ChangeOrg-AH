<p>Since few days the social media was swarming in with #johnnydepp and #amberheard  #defamation  trial, I watched and followed most of its sessions even the one today and thought of writing down on a subject that stirred my thought seeing this trial / This write up has no correlation with the trial or any Influence of my fanside as I like both of them equally .

<p><br>✏️Women do verbally and #physically  assault men, yes it does happen , and it’s not only self protection but with intention to hurt and cause harm</p>
<p>✏️A woman has the privilege to talk it out and vent herself on a man's shoulders and laugh with her friends about it and humiliate him, yes this happens .<br>Do you think it’s fine ?</p>
<p>✏️A woman can cut off a man's finger tip in a heated argument and engages in physical altercation and yet no one gives a heck about it. Like really ? Why </p>
<p><br>✏️A woman can gas light a man into doing things he does not want to do and force him to become aggressive and play a victim later . </p>
<p><br>✏️A woman can talk poorly about a man's kids from his previous #marriage  breaking his self-respect and ruining and #tarnishing him in front his own kids and making him show low for the kind of choices he made including herself, should she be allowed to do that ? Who gave her those rights, Just her womanhood ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>✏️A man can be #trauma  bonded into submission and can loose his self confidence . Yes , because he is also a human after all. And it’s surprising to many </p>
<p>✏️A man can love hard and be fearful of failure and force himself to stay</p>
