This article was titled: “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.”</p>
<p>The article starts by narrating how from a young age the author of the opinion piece has had to contend and deal with varying degrees of abuse. Given the ambiguity surrounding who exactly the author refers to outside of her own family struggles it can be reasoned no single individual is referenced and as such these early accounts by the author provide sound and powerful testimony from which other survivors of domestic abuse can relate.</p>
<p>The author concludes that from their experiences in childhood and adolescence that women have had to operate within a system where men typically hold physical, social and financial power over women and this dynamic is further enhanced and maintained through the support of many large institutions. Again this element of the article is well within the rights of the author to express under the freedom of speech laws of the land. </p>
<p>However it is my opinion that the Op-ed becomes problematic when the author states in 2016 they became 'a public figure representing domestic abuse'.</p>
<p>By specifying the year in which they became a 'representative' for domestic violence survivors the author knowingly forwarded the allegation that they had been abused at the hands of their then partner Johnny Depp. It was well documented that in 2016 Amber Heard got a Temporary restraining order against Johnny Depp while he was out of the country on a movie tour.</p>
<p>My view is if there had been a civil or criminal court case that ruled on the authors favour, prior to the release of the Op-ed, these statements would be completely fair and reasonable to state. However in the absence of this verdict the author wrongly infringed upon the right of Johnny Depp to defend themselves under the concept of 'innocent until proven guilty'. </p>
<p>Furthermore It must be said that the lack of due diligence from the Washington Post, prior to the article's publication, was shocking and completely against the processes in which most News outlets look to break a story. There was no communication carried out to Johnny Depp's side prior to the article's release in order to get their rebuttal. As such the Washington Post released an article condemning someone without any  evidence other than 'hearsay' testimony. </p>
<p>Moving forward to 1st June 2022 Johnny Depp was able to achieve a clear verdict in which all the points raised in the Op-ed was viewed as completely defamatory and false.</p>
<p>As such the aim of my petition is simple. The Washington Post should look to:</p>
<p>(A) Rewrite the article and omit all insinuations of domestic abuse on the part of Johnny Depp against Amber Heard</p>
<p>(B) completely remove the article from their site</p>
<p>Irrespective of which point is carried out the publication should <strong>issue an apology</strong> for having released the article without taking the time to ensure these allegations were legitimised via a court case or at the very least a counter response from Johnny Depp.</p>
<p><strong>To note: </strong>As of 3rd June 2022 the Washington Post have only issued an editors note stating the outcome of the 2022 court case. Given the clear verdict I do not believe the publication's current action goes far enough. The defamatory statements should be removed from the article or the article completely removed. </p>",Washington Post,The Washington Post should now properly amend or remove the Op-ed written by Amber Heard,,,,GB,55.3781,-3.43597,,,,,the-washington-post-should-now-properly-amend-or-remove-the-op-ed-written-by-amber-heard,published,,,False,False,,False,,[],True,False,,130,130,2,218,28,2,24,0,0,0,0,,,,,,226671569,photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-400x400-noPad.jpg?1654530178,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-400x225-noPad.jpg?1654530178,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-800x450-noPad.jpg?1654530178,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1654530179,False,1600,900,photo,1268152318,1268152318,Enoch,Baffour,Enoch,Enoch Baffour,,,GB,,en-GB,,[],26,1654797982,8,1654555356.669,2,1654593254.958,3,1662542389.729,1,1654555864.463,3,1654548071.832,"[{'id': 592649, 'display_name': 'Washington Post', 'email': None, 'type': 'Custom', 'slug': 'washington-post-7', 'description': '', 'publicly_visible': True, 'verified_at': None, 'summary': None, 'locale': 'en-US', 'confirmed_at': '2016-08-03T19:00:50Z', 'is_person': True, 'member_of': {}, 'additional_data': {'first_name': 'Washington', 'last_name': 'Post', 'title': None, 'id': 37989}, 'has_email': False, 'photo': {'id': 146181155, 'url': 'photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-fullsize.jpg', 'sizes': {'small': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-48x48-noPad.jpg?1529264162', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 48, 'height': 48}}, 'medium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-128x128-noPad.jpg?1529264162', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 128, 'height': 128}}, 'large': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-400x400-noPad.jpg?1529264162', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 400, 'height': 400}}, 'xlarge': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-800x800-noPad.jpg?1529264162', 'processing': False, 'size': {'width': 800, 'height': 800}}}}}]",False,False,False,Enoch Baffour,The Washington Post should now properly amend or remove the Op-ed written by Amber Heard,The Washington Post should now properly amend or remove the Op-ed written by Amber Heard,active,200,226671569,photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-400x400-noPad.jpg?1654530178,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-400x225-noPad.jpg?1654530178,False,400,225,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-800x450-noPad.jpg?1654530178,False,800,450,//assets.change.org/photos/4/jz/ck/vVjZcKHRlePYLRG-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1654530179,False,1600,900,photo,592649,Washington Post,,Custom,washington-post-7,,True,,,en-US,2016-08-03T19:00:50Z,True,Washington,Post,,37989,False,146181155,photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-fullsize.jpg,//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-48x48-noPad.jpg?1529264162,False,48,48,//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-128x128-noPad.jpg?1529264162,False,128,128,//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-400x400-noPad.jpg?1529264162,False,400,400,//assets.change.org/photos/4/ne/tj/tDnetjrJQaqZtjR-800x800-noPad.jpg?1529264162,False,800,800,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article was titled: “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.”</p>
<p>The article starts by narrating how from a young age the author of the opinion piece has had to contend and deal with varying degrees of abuse. Given the ambiguity surrounding who exactly the author refers to outside of her own family struggles it can be reasoned no single individual is referenced and as such these early accounts by the author provide sound and powerful testimony from which other survivors of domestic abuse can relate.</p>
<p>The author concludes that from their experiences in childhood and adolescence that women have had to operate within a system where men typically hold physical, social and financial power over women and this dynamic is further enhanced and maintained through the support of many large institutions. Again this element of the article is well within the rights of the author to express under the freedom of speech laws of the land. </p>
<p>However it is my opinion that the Op-ed becomes problematic when the author states in 2016 they became 'a public figure representing domestic abuse'.</p>
<p>By specifying the year in which they became a 'representative' for domestic violence survivors the author knowingly forwarded the allegation that they had been abused at the hands of their then partner Johnny Depp. It was well documented that in 2016 Amber Heard got a Temporary restraining order against Johnny Depp while he was out of the country on a movie tour.</p>
<p>My view is if there had been a civil or criminal court case that ruled on the authors favour, prior to the release of the Op-ed, these statements would be completely fair and reasonable to state. However in the absence of this verdict the author wrongly infringed upon the right of Johnny Depp to defend themselves under the concept of 'innocent until proven guilty'. </p>
<p>Furthermore It must be said that the lack of due diligence from the Washington Post, prior to the article's publication, was shocking and completely against the processes in which most News outlets look to break a story. There was no communication carried out to Johnny Depp's side prior to the article's release in order to get their rebuttal. As such the Washington Post released an article condemning someone without any  evidence other than 'hearsay' testimony. </p>
<p>Moving forward to 1st June 2022 Johnny Depp was able to achieve a clear verdict in which all the points raised in the Op-ed was viewed as completely defamatory and false.</p>
<p>As such the aim of my petition is simple. The Washington Post should look to:</p>
<p>(A) Rewrite the article and omit all insinuations of domestic abuse on the part of Johnny Depp against Amber Heard</p>
<p>(B) completely remove the article from their site</p>
<p>Irrespective of which point is carried out the publication should <strong>issue an apology</strong> for having released the article without taking the time to ensure these allegations were legitimised via a court case or at the very least a counter response from Johnny Depp.</p>
<p><strong>To note: </strong>As of 3rd June 2022 the Washington Post have only issued an editors note stating the outcome of the 2022 court case. Given the clear verdict I do not believe the publication's current action goes far enough.

This article was titled: “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.”</p>
<p>The article starts by narrating how from a young age the author of the opinion piece has had to contend and deal with varying degrees of abuse. Given the ambiguity surrounding who exactly the author refers to outside of her own family struggles it can be reasoned no single individual is referenced and as such these early accounts by the author provide sound and powerful testimony from which other survivors of domestic abuse can relate.</p>
<p>The author concludes that from their experiences in childhood and adolescence that women have had to operate within a system where men typically hold physical, social and financial power over women and this dynamic is further enhanced and maintained through the support of many large institutions. Again this element of the article is well within the rights of the author to express under the freedom of speech laws of the land. </p>
<p>However it is my opinion that the Op-ed becomes problematic when the author states in 2016 they became 'a public figure representing domestic abuse'.</p>
<p>By specifying the year in which they became a 'representative' for domestic violence survivors the author knowingly forwarded the allegation that they had been abused at the hands of their then partner Johnny Depp. It was well documented that in 2016 Amber Heard got a Temporary restraining order against Johnny Depp while he was out of the country on a movie tour.</p>
<p>My view is if there had been a civil or criminal court case that ruled on the authors favour, prior to the release of the Op-ed, these statements would be completely fair and reasonable to state. However in the absence of this verdict the author wrongly infringed upon the right of Johnny Depp to defend themselves under the concept of 'innocent until proven guilty'. </p>
<p>Furthermore It must be said that the lack of due diligence from the Washington Post, prior to the article's publication, was shocking and completely against the processes in which most News outlets look to break a story. There was no communication carried out to Johnny Depp's side prior to the article's release in order to get their rebuttal. As such the Washington Post released an article condemning someone without any  evidence other than 'hearsay' testimony. </p>
<p>Moving forward to 1st June 2022 Johnny Depp was able to achieve a clear verdict in which all the points raised in the Op-ed was viewed as completely defamatory and false.</p>
<p>As such the aim of my petition is simple. The Washington Post should look to:</p>
<p>(A) Rewrite the article and omit all insinuations of domestic abuse on the part of Johnny Depp against Amber Heard</p>
<p>(B) completely remove the article from their site</p>
<p>Irrespective of which point is carried out the publication should <strong>issue an apology</strong> for having released the article without taking the time to ensure these allegations were legitimised via a court case or at the very least a counter response from Johnny Depp.</p>
<p><strong>To note: </strong>As of 3rd June 2022 the Washington Post have only issued an editors note stating the outcome of the 2022 court case.
