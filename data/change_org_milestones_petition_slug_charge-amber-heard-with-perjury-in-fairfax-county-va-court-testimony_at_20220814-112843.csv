StarterPetitionUpdate,30620416,2022-06-02T23:31:02.000Z,,New Perjury Proven,<p>It’s been discovered that Amber Heard and her attorney committed perjury together. Amber testified under oath she paid $6 million in legal fees and her attorney repeated this during closing. It was now discovered Ambers home owners insurance company has been paying the bill for legal fees. This is a clear violation of her lawyers ethical obligation and she could be disbarred for it. This is also further proof Amber willfully got on the stand to commit perjury. This new detail will be added to the petition. We will also send this same petition to the Va Bar association to demand her attorney be investigated. </p>,,,
